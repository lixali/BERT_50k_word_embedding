 "text": "The City of Manningham is a local government area in Victoria, Australia in the north-eastern suburbs of Melbourne and is divided into 12 suburbs, with the largest being Doncaster and Doncaster East. It comprises an area of 113 square kilometres and had a population of 125,508 in June 2018. The district spans a roughly east–west direction along the southern banks of the Yarra River and across the undulating valleys of the Koonung, Ruffey and Mullum Mullum Creeks, alternating from typical low density suburban housing in the west to remnant bushland, within a green wedge, in the east. As such, the district encompasses the transition between the built and natural environments in Melbourne's east and promotes itself as a \"balance of city and country\". Formerly the City of Doncaster & Templestowe, the district is situated in the Wurundjeri nation's territory. Most of the first European settlers to the area were orchardists, arriving through the 1850s. Gold was first discovered in Victoria around the same time at Andersons Creek, in Warrandyte, however, the district saw varied growth as periods of low density suburban development occurred sporadically throughout the mid-late 20th century. ==History== The Manningham municipality was created on 15 December 1994, as part of a general restructure of Melbourne's local government boundaries. The new municipality contains the former City of Doncaster & Templestowe, but with part of Ringwood North ceded to the new City of Maroondah and Wonga Park, annexed from the former Shire of Lillydale. The name Bulleen, a nearby suburb, was proposed for the new municipality, as it was the name of the shire predating the City of Doncaster and Templestowe. However, modern residents believed the name was too localised, so the name of one of the major roads was adopted. The origin of Manningham Road comes from the region of Bradford, West Yorkshire, England. Residents' requests for the City to be named after Indigenous Australian names local to the area such as Mullum Mullum or Koonung were rejected. ==Geography== 250px|thumb|right|Mullum Mullum Creek in Victoria, Australia The main watercourses that border or flow through the City of Manningham include; * Yarra River * Mullum Mullum Creek * Koonung Creek * Ruffey Creek *Anderson's Creek *Hopping Creek *Jumping Creek *Skipping Creek ==Structure== ===Federal electorate=== The Federal electorate of Menzies covers much of the City of Manningham.

A Doncaster railway line had been planned for many decades; however the land was sold off in the 1980s. Residents have long campaigned for extension of the route 48 tram along Doncaster Road to Doncaster, Doncaster East or Donvale, although this is heavily supported by Local Governments, the issue has been consistently avoided by State Government. There are increased bus services to cope with the demand for public transport, including four radial SmartBus routes, and two exclusive Manningham Mover circular routes. Most routes are operated by Kinetic Melbourne, which has a depot in Doncaster East, near the intersection of Blackburn and Doncaster Roads. ===Major roadways=== * Andersons Creek Road (State Route 13) * Blackburn Road (State Route 13) * Bulleen Road (State Route 52) * Croydon Road (State Route 7) * Doncaster Road (State Route 36 / State Route 40) * Eastern Freeway (M3) * Elgar Road * High Street * Fitzsimons Lane (State Route 47) * Foote Street (State Route 42 / State Route 52) * King Street * Jumping Creek Road (State Route 42) * Manningham Road (State Route 40) * Mitcham Road (State Route 36 / State Route 40) * Northern Route: ** Reynolds Road (State Route 52) ** Tindals Road ** Falconer Road ** Stintons Road * Park Road * Springvale Road (State Route 40 / State Route 52) * Templestowe Road (State Route 52) * Thompsons Road (State Route 42) * Tram Road (State Route 47) * Warrandyte Road: ** Heidelberg-Warrandyte Road (State Route 13) ** Warrandyte-Ringwood Road (State Route 9 / State Route 42) * Wetherby Road (State Route 23) * Williamsons Road (State Route 47) ==Notable residents== * Charles \"Bud\" Tingwell (died 2009) * Karl von Möller – Australian Cinematographer, Director * Alisa Camplin – Aerial skier, Olympic gold medallist * Michele Timms – Basketballer, Olympic silver medallist * Stephen Mayne – Journalist, Councillor for Heide Ward from 2008 to 2011 * Jade Rawlings – Former AFL player * Mark \"Jacko\" Jackson – AFL Footballer and Actor * Greg Evans – Australian television presenter * Kim Crow, Olympic rower * Scott Martin, an Australian shot putter, who is best known for appearing on Commonwealth Bank TV advertisements, which aired during the 2006 Commonwealth Games. * Mark Wilson – Ran a dance studio on Thompsons Road in Templestowe until it was burnt down in 2008. * Roy Robbins-Browne – Professor Roy Robins- Browne was appointed an Officer of the Order (AO) “For distinguished service to education and research in the field of microbiology and immunology and to professional groups” on 26 January, as announced in the Australia Day 2020 Honours ListProfessor Roy Robins-Browne receives Order of Australia ==See also== * List of Melbourne suburbs ==References== ==External links== * Official website *Public Transport Victoria local public transport map *Link to Land Victoria interactive maps Category:Local government areas in Melbourne",
