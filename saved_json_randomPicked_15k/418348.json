He was selected as the second choice of the Nashville Predators. He made his National Hockey League (NHL) debut on January 8, 2001 in a 2–1 loss against the Vancouver Canucks in Vancouver. During this game he notched his first NHL point when he got an assist on a Richard Lintner goal against Bob Essensa. Two days later he scored his first NHL goal in a 5–2 win at the Edmonton Oilers. He scored when he took a Scott Hartnell pass and got it past Tommy Salo. He also got an assist on a Marián Cisár goal to make this his first ever NHL multi-point game. In the 2001–02 NHL season he played in all 82 games with a career high 42 points. He led the Predators in goals, game-winning goals (6) and shooting percentage (16.9%). That year he centered the \"Vowel Line\" which also included, Vladimír Országh on right wing, and Martin Erat at left wing. They were called the Vowel Line because their last names all start with vowels. Arkhipov played the 2004–05 NHL lockout season in the Russian Super League, and remained there for the 2005–06 season before signing as a free agent with the Chicago Blackhawks on July 6, 2006. ==Records== Youngest player in Predator's franchise history to score 20 goals. ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
