He was the designer and programmer of 1985's The Bard's Tale and 1986's The Bard's Tale II: The Destiny Knight role-playing video games published by Interplay Productions. He also programmed the Apple II version of Donkey Kong, the Commodore 64 version of Super Zaxxon, as well as Maze Master (a spiritual predecessor of The Bard's Tale). His last video game was Dark Seed for Cyberdreams in 1992. He left the video game industry to pursue graduate studies, and thus was not involved in the creation of 1988's The Bard's Tale III. Almost thirty years later, however, he was approached by inXile Entertainment to assist with the development of The Bard's Tale IV and had agreed to provide feedback and advice for the new game. He is currently developing the video game Wisewands in the crypto-gaming space. ===Games=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Name ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Credited with ! scope=\"col\" | Publisher |- | Story Machine (VIC-20 port) || 1983 || programmer || Human Engineered Software |- | Maze Master || 1983 || designer, programmer || Human Engineered Software |- | Super Zaxxon (C64 port) || 1984 || programmer || Human Engineered Software |- | Donkey Kong (Apple II port) || 1984 || programmer || Atarisoft |- | The Bard's Tale || 1985 || designer, programmer || Electronic Arts |- | Borrowed Time || 1985 || writer || Activision |- | The Bard's Tale II: The Destiny Knight || 1986 || designer, programmer || Electronic Arts |- | Centauri Alliance || 1990 || designer, programmer || Broderbund |- | Dark Seed || 1992 || designer || Cyberdreams |- | Wisewands || 2022 || designer || Sundoulos |} == Academic career == He was a professor for eight years at Biola University in La Mirada, California, gaining his Master of Divinity degree from Biola and a master's degree in Social Ethics from the University of Southern California.
