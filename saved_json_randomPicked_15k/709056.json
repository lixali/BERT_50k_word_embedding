It is the inner terminal of the famous Puffing Billy heritage steam railway. Belgrave (Puffing Billy) is adjacent to, and forms an interchange with, Belgrave suburban railway station, which is the outer terminal of the Belgrave line of Melbourne's broad gauge (5 ft 3in) electric suburban network. The suburban station is accessible via a short footpath. Before this station was built, the original narrow gauge line ran from the original site of the narrow-gauge station (approximately where the existing Metro station car park is) to Selby station. ==Gallery== File:PuffingBillyBelgraveStation2.jpg|thumb|The entrance and booking windows of Belgrave Station ==See also== * Puffing Billy Railway == External links == * Melway map * Official website Category:Tourist railway stations in Melbourne",
