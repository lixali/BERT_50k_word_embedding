Cheshunt is the most populated town in the borough Broxbourne with a population of 45,832 according to the United Kingdom's 2011 census. == History and geography == The Prime Meridian passes to the east of Cheshunt. The town name comes from the Old English name (as recorded in the Domesday Book) for the area, Cestrehunt, which probably refers to a \"castle, erected by the Romans\", the word cestre (along with the form ceastre), or even its modern forms, chester and caster being derived from the Latin castrum meaning \"fort\".Tompkins, Herbert Winckworth (2008) Hertfordshire; illustrated by Edmund H.

Cheshunt was a settlement on Ermine Street, the main Roman road leading north from London. Before the Norman Conquest, the manor of Cheshunt was held by Eddeva the Fair, but William I granted it to Alan of Brittany. The parish church of St Mary the Virgin was first recorded in a charter of 1146, but was entirely rebuilt between 1418 and 1448 with a three-stage tower topped by an octagonal turret. As Princess Elizabeth, Queen Elizabeth I lived at Cheshunt in the care of Sir Anthony Denny, after she left Queen Catherine Parr's household in 1548.http://www.oxfordinstitutepress.com/files/Oxford_Midas_Press_Release.pdf Richard Cromwell, Lord Protector of the Commonwealth, died here in 1712. In 1825, Cheshunt was also the location of the Cheshunt Railway. Running from the town's High Street to the River Lea near the present-day Cheshunt railway station, this horse-drawn line was the first passenger-carrying monorail and the first railway line to be built in Hertfordshire. The town's Bury Green neighbourhood was once the home of singer Cliff Richard. Lotus Cars as well as the central headquarters the Debenhams store chain were formerly located in Cheshunt, and the headquarters of Tesco, the UK's largest supermarket chain, was located here until 2016. In 2002, Cheshunt hosted the only officially licensed European BotCon convention ever. In 1957, a review of how London was governed was undertaken by government and led by Sir Edwin Herbert, who was appointed to create the new Greater London conurbation as it is today. Initially, Cheshunt was planned to be merged in with the London Borough of Enfield; however, the plan was eventually dropped and Cheshunt remained part of Hertfordshire. The Metropolitan Police Service served Cheshunt until 2000, when policing was taken over by Hertfordshire Constabulary. Services in Cheshunt include the Brookfield Centre, which includes Next, Boots, Argos, River Island and Marks & Spencer stores, as well as a large Tesco Extra store. There was a Marriott Hotel nearby (which closed in 2020), and the town centre includes a wide variety of smaller shops. Being located in the Lea Valley, Cheshunt has access to the Lee Valley Park. The park is accessible at many points, one being extremely close to the town's railway station at Windmill Lane.

There is no parish or town council in Cheshunt, which has been an unparished area since 1974. Historically, the parish of Cheshunt was in the hundred of Hertford. As well as Cheshunt itself, the parish also included Waltham Cross. From 1837 the parish of Cheshunt was included in the Edmonton Poor Law Union. On 13 July 1850 the parish of Cheshunt was made a local board of health district. After elections, the first meeting of the Cheshunt Local Board of Health was held in October 1850, with John Sanders being appointed the first chairman of the board. Under the Local Government Act 1894, Cheshunt Local Board became Cheshunt Urban District Council on 31 December 1894. For the first few years the council used St Mary's Hall on College Road as its offices and meeting place, as the Local Board had done. Around 1901 the council moved to a large 1860s house called the Manor House at 22 Turners Hill (not to be confused with Cheshunt Great House).The house was occupied by a family called Gower in the 1901 census (taken on 31 March 1901), when it is listed as 22 Turners Hill, whilst the Kelly's Directory of 1902 records the council as being based at Manor House. Cheshunt's public library was built in the grounds of the Manor House in 1907. Cheshunt Urban District Council was granted a coat of arms on 25 November 1944. Cheshunt Urban District was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, becoming part of the borough of Broxbourne on 1 April 1974. No successor parish was created for the town, and so it became an unparished area. The Manor House was demolished in the 1980s and Edwards Court built on the site.Broxbourne Planning Application 7/710/1987 for: Demolition former Council Offices and erection of 3-storey building comprising 51 sheltered flats with house managerâ€™s apartment, ancillary accommodation and car parking, at Manor House / Glen Luce, Turners Hill, Cheshunt == Industry == Cheshunt's best-known employer was Tesco, whose head office was in Delamare Road, Cheshunt for many years. A small store in the town centre is still open today, while \"Home 'n' Wear\" store, which was situated across the Old Pond in College Road, is now closed.Tesco Home 'N' Wear Retrieved 19 April 2011 In 1983 a new out-of-town Tesco store located to the north of the town opened, named \"Brookfield Farm\". It later expanded, a branch of Marks & Spencer was built next door, and the entire estate was renamed \"The Brookfield Centre\". Tesco announced in 2015 that it would move its headquarters to Welwyn Garden City.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-30712762 \"Tesco to close 43 stores across UK\" [BBC News] 8 January 2015 retrieved 8 January 2015 In 1959, Colin Chapman moved his fledgling Lotus group of companies, including Lotus Cars and Team Lotus, from its outgrown premises at Hornsey to a purpose-built facility on Delamare Road. Racing cars from here won the first two of its seven constructor championships in ( and ) before moving to Hethel, Norfolk, in 1966. thumb|North Met Pit, flooded gravel workingsUntil the late 1960s the main land use around Cheshunt was for its nursery industry, and many new techniques for growing under glass were developed here. Thomas Rochford had a large concern here, although now almost all the glasshouses have been redeveloped into housing estates. This is often reflected in the names of the roads or estates, such as Rosedale or Thomas Rochford Way. A small amount of nursery trade survives to the west of the town. The neighbouring town of Goffs Oak still has a large number of nurseries as well as a large garden centre. The River Lee Navigation passes the east of Cheshunt and was used for the transport of flowers and crops to the London markets for many years until road transport became more viable. A wharf existed just east of the railway on the site now occupied by Herts Young Mariners Base. The Youth Hostel was built on the site of the derelict open-air swimming pool.Herts Young Mariners Retrieved 5 April 2010 \"Cheshunt Compound\", a fungicide developed at the Cheshunt Research Station, was widely used by amateur and professional gardeners but has been withdrawn from sale in the UK since November 2010 and it is no longer legal to use it. It was a mixture of copper sulphate and ammonium carbonate.Coutts, J, Edwards, A, Osborn, A, & Preston, GH, The Complete Book of Gardening, p. 533, Ward Lock, London (1954) From the end of World War II a large area of the River Lea flood plain was used for sand and gravel extraction which resulted in the creation of the now mature lakes which are popular with anglers, birdwatchers and naturalists. The area now forms part of the River Lee Country Park and the Turnford and Cheshunt Pits SSSI. == Notable people == thumb|221x221px|Cliff Richard performing in Sydney, Australia * Cliff Richard, singer, musician and actor * Laura Kenny, quadruple Olympic Gold Medal cyclist * Queen Elizabeth I stayed here on occasion in her younger life. * King James I lived here in his later life, and died at Theobalds Palace. * Victoria Beckham, singer, fashion designer, attended St Mary's High School, Cheshunt. * Michael Birch, founder of Bebo * Cardinal Wolsey was given land in Cheshunt by King Henry VIII.
