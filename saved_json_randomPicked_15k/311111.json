The arboretum was founded by Dr Wilfrid Fox, starting in 1938 and continuing through World War II. He cleared the land and planted it with carefully chosen trees and shrubs to maximise its autumnal appearance. Once it was established, he presented it to the National Trust in 1952. Winkworth Arboretum exhibits over 1000 species of trees as well as large collections of azalea, rhododendron, and holly on slopes leading down to landscaped garden lakes. Gertrude Jekyll explored the woods in the early 20th century. ==References== ==External links== *Winkworth Arboretum - Official site at the National Trust Category:Arboreta in England Category:Botanical gardens in England Category:Gardens in Surrey Category:National Trust properties in Surrey Category:Parks and open spaces in Surrey Category:Busbridge, Surrey Category:Lakes of Surrey",
