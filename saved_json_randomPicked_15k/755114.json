 "text": "Pont-Saint-Esprit (, literally \"Holy Spirit Bridge\"; ) is a commune in the Gard département in southern France. It is situated on the river Rhône and is the site of a historical crossing, hence its name. The Ardèche flows into the Rhône, just to the north of the bridge. The residents are called Spiripontains. ==History== The bridge was observed by the Irish pilgrim Symon Semeonis in 1323 on his way to the Holy Land: \"Pont-Saint-Esprit where there is a famous stone bridge over the Rhône, half a mile in length, the height of which and the breadth of its arches are greatly admired by all those who cross over it.\" Italian Canon Antonio de Beatis described the bridge in his 1517-1518 travel journal: \"This has twenty tall, wide arches, is finely built in a pleasing stone and is still better paved.\"Antonio de Beatis. The Travel Journal of Antonio de Beatis, 1517-1518. Translated by J.R. Hale (Ed) and J.M.A. Lindon. Hakluyt Society (1979) ==Bouvier family origins== Pont-Saint- Esprit is famous as the town of origin of Michel Bouvier, a cabinetmaker, who was the ancestor of John Vernou Bouvier III, father of Jacqueline Kennedy. ==1951 mass poisoning incident== On 15 August 1951, an outbreak of poisoning, marked by acute psychotic episodes and various physical symptoms, occurred in Pont-Saint-Esprit. More than 250 people were involved, including 50 persons interned in asylums and four deaths.
