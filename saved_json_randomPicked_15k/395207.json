It is currently the second- largest domain registrar worldwide and operates OpenSRS, Enom, Ascio and Hover, platforms for domain owners and resellers. It continued to host its namesake directory of shareware and freeware software downloads until early 2021. In 2012, Tucows launched Ting, a wireless service provider and fiber Internet provider. The company was formed in Flint, Michigan, United States, in 1993. The Tucows logo was two cow heads, a play on the homophone \"two cows\". == Origins == Scott Swedorski, a Flint native, started working as a computer lab manager at Flint's Mott Community College in 1991. By late 1992, Swedorski left Mott College to work at the Genesee County Library System as a system administrator for FALCON (Flint Area Library Cooperative Online Network) and saw a need to bring shareware reviews to the public. In 1993 he formed TUCOWS (The Ultimate Collection Of Winsock SoftwareAl Harberg, DP Director. \"TUCOWS' founder and president Scott Swedorski announced earlier this week that he has resigned from TUCOWS\", November 30, 2003.) leading all editorial, reviews, HTML programming and scripting. ==Company history== 250px|right|thumb|Tucows headquarters in Toronto In the early 1990s, Tucows was hosted on university and public servers (much like Yahoo! and Google were in their early stages). TUCOWS' mission was to provide users with downloads of both freeware and trial versions of shareware. Internet Direct, owned and operated by John Nemanic, Bill Campbell, and Colin Campbell, acquired Tucows in 1996. STI Ventures acquired Tucows in 1999. The company employed roughly 30 employees in Flint, Michigan, in 1998 with additional employees in Canada. For several years Scott Swedorski personally oversaw day-to-day activity in the Flint office located in the White House building on Beecher Road. In 2000, Tucows acquired Linux Weekly News (which was then \"unacquired\" in 2002).

In January 2006, Tucows completed its acquisition of certain assets of Critical Path, an outsourced email services provider. In June 2006 Tucows paid $18 million to purchase Mailbank.com Inc, a company that owns over 17,000 domain names for common surnames, such as smith.net and brown.org. Mailbank generates income from ads on its websites (from domain parking) and also from customers who want e-mail accounts with their surname in the domain name. On June 15, 2006, Noss disclosed that the portfolio of NetIdentity's domain names acquired by Tucows represents at least 68% of surnames in the United States and Europe, and that the cost of the acquisition was $18 million.\"Tucows Podcast on Its NetIdentity Acquisition - Transcript\", Seeking Alpha, June 15, 2006.

On November 14, 2007, Tucows disclosed that they offer pay-per-click advertising on the pages of domains within their domain name portfolio. When a user types one of these domain names into the address of the browser (direct navigation), they are presented with dynamically generated links which are pay-per-click advertising.

Tucows announced on June 12, 2008, that they have reached an agreement with Afternic to auction Tucows’ large daily inventory of expired domain names. \"We have over eight million domains under management and thousands expiring every day, so this deal provides us with a great way to share revenue with our resellers while participating in Afternic’s popular secondary domain name marketplace”, said Bill Sweetman, General Manager of Tucows Domain Portfolio. \"Tucows Collaborates With Namemedia’s Afternic.Com To Auction Daily Inventory Of Expired Domain Names\", Tucows Press Release, June 12, 2008.

A National Arbitration Forum panel determined that the dealership had not established rights in the mark \"Batchelor\". In fact, Tucows has won all surname-related arbitration proceedings. In 2007, Weidner Investment Services filed a complaint claiming that Weidner was its trademark or service mark and asked the National Arbitration Forum to order the transfer of Weidner.com from Tucows to Weidner. Tucows failed to respond, and the National Arbitration Forum ordered Tucows to transfer Weidner.com to Weidner Investment Services.\"Weidner Investment Services, Inc. v. Tucows.com Co.\" Claim Number: FA0709001080246, National Arbitration Forum, November 7, 2007.

Starting August 12, 2008, Tucows Email Service running on their servers designated as Cluster A experienced a multi-day outage lasting until August 15, 2008. On October 6, 2008, Cluster A again suffered another multi-day outage affecting at least 50% of users and at times all users.

Tucows also expected to receive income for pay per click advertising revenue from domain parking the surnames. ===Mobile phone services=== In February 2012, Tucows launched a new mobile virtual network operator in the United States known as Ting, which resells voice and data services on the T-Mobile US network. As of July 2018, the service had approximately 286,000 subscribers.

On February 7, 2008, Tucows disclosed that Tucows plans to de-emphasize the software download aspect of their business. The download service was finally closed down in January 2021.Retiring Tucows Downloads, tucows.com, 21 January 2021, archived at the Wayback Machine ===Divestment of web hosting accounts=== On May 6, 2008, Tucows announced that they are getting out of the web hosting business. \"Hostopia to acquire certain shared hosting customer assets of Tucows Retail Service Group\", Tucows Press Release, May 6, 2008.

That means, for example, not putting 60-day locks on domains when a Registrant makes a change to their WHOIS information effectively locking some into a renewal and blocking domain name transfers to other Registrars. That also means having a clear, defined policy surrounding expiry and redemption periods.\" Tucows addresses domain tasting \"by charging our Resellers a monetary fee on domain name registrations that are cancelled within the five-day Add Grace Period (AGP)\", but it \"doesn’t use WHOIS query data or search data from our API to front-run domain names\".James Koole, \"Registrar Reputation and Trust\", January 8, 2008. Although it supports ICANN’s fee to discourage domain tasting and Google's decision to drop names added and deleted during the AGP from its AdSense program, Tucows claimed that AGP abuse could be further curbed by shortening the AGP period to 12 hours or less, sufficient time for registrants to correct spelling mistakes—AGP's original purpose.Adam Eisner, \"ICANN Proposed Tasting Fee a Good First Step\", Tucows Blog, January 30, 2008. ===Registrations to sites selling illegal goods and connections to terrorism=== In 2015, the U.S. Trade Representative included Tucows on its annual \"notorious markets\" list—the first time it has named a domain name registrar—in order to set an example for what happens to registrars that do not block or suspend sites that sell illegal goods. Tucows responded that it suspended dozens of sites every day, but that \"unlike some competitors, it considered all complaints carefully to ensure they were justified\". Tucows used to be the domain name registrar for the notorious American imageboard 8chan, which has been delisted by Google for hosting child pornography, and also seen numerous swatting attacks and terrorist attacks announced and planned by users, notably the 2019 New Zealand Terror Attack. It is also a domain name registrar for the white nationalist website Stormfront. == Leadership == * Elliot Noss - President & Chief Executive Officer - Tucows and Ting Internet * Dave Singh - Chief Financial Officer * Jessica Johannson - Chief People Officer * Bret Fausett - Chief Legal Officer * Justin Reilly - Chief Executive Officer - Wavelo * David Woroch - Chief Executive Officer - Tucows Domains Source: == Board of Directors == *Robin Chase - Chairperson of the Board of Directors * Allen Karp, Q.C. * Marlene Carl * Erez Gissin * Jeffery Schwartz * Brad Burnham * Elliot Noss Source: ==See also== * Domain name registrar * Hover (domain registrar) ==References== ==External links== * Tucows Corporate Website Category:Companies listed on the Nasdaq Category:Companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange Category:Companies formerly listed on NYSE American Category:Software companies of Canada Category:2005 initial public offerings Category:Software companies established in 1993 Category:1993 establishments in Michigan Category:Companies based in Toronto",
