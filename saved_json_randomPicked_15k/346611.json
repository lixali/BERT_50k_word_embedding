 "text": "In mathematics, an axiom of countability is a property of certain mathematical objects that asserts the existence of a countable set with certain properties. Without such an axiom, such a set might not provably exist. ==Important examples== Important countability axioms for topological spaces include:. *sequential space: a set is open if every sequence convergent to a point in the set is eventually in the set *first-countable space: every point has a countable neighbourhood basis (local base) *second-countable space: the topology has a countable base *separable space: there exists a countable dense subset *Lindelöf space: every open cover has a countable subcover *σ-compact space: there exists a countable cover by compact spaces ==Relationships with each other== These axioms are related to each other in the following ways: *Every first-countable space is sequential. *Every second-countable space is first countable, separable, and Lindelöf. *Every σ-compact space is Lindelöf. *Every metric space is first countable. *For metric spaces, second- countability, separability, and the Lindelöf property are all equivalent. ==Related concepts== Other examples of mathematical objects obeying axioms of countability include sigma-finite measure spaces, and lattices of countable type. ==References== Category:General topology Category:Mathematical axioms",
