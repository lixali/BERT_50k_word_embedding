 "text": "David John Stevenson (born 2 September 1948) is a professor of planetary science at Caltech. Originally from New Zealand, he received his Ph.D. from Cornell University in physics, where he proposed a model for the interior of Jupiter. He is well known for applying fluid mechanics and magnetohydrodynamics to understand the internal structure and evolution of planets and moons. ==Sending a probe into the Earth== thumb|Dave Stevenson on a lecture Stevenson's tongue-in-cheek idea about sending a probe into the earth includes the use of nuclear weapons to crack the Earth's crust, simultaneously melting and filling the crack with molten iron containing a probe. The iron, by the action of its weight, will propagate a crack into the mantle and would subsequently sink and reach the Earth's core in weeks. Communication with the probe would be achieved with modulated acoustic waves. This idea was used in the book Artemis Fowl: The Opal Deception. ==Honors and awards== In 1984, he received the H. C. Urey Prize awarded by the Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society. Stevenson is a fellow of the Royal Society and a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences. Minor planet 5211 Stevenson is named in his honor. ==See also== * Travel to the Earth's center * Theoretical planetology ==References and sources== ==External links== *Web Site at Caltech Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences Category:21st-century American astronomers Category:Cornell University alumni Category:20th-century New Zealand astronomers Category:Planetary scientists Category:New Zealand Fellows of the Royal Society",
