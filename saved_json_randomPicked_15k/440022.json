 "text": "The Highlands and Islands is one of the eight electoral regions of the Scottish Parliament which were created in 1999. Eight of the parliament's first past the post constituencies are sub-divisions of the region and it elects seven of the 56 additional-member Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). The name Highlands and Islands is much older than the electoral region. The Highlands and Islands area has a large area of overlap with the Scottish Highlands, and the two names are often regarded as representing the same area. The Highlands and Islands region is the largest of the eight electoral regions in terms of area, but the smallest in terms of population and electorate. It has boundaries with the North East Scotland, Mid Scotland and Fife and the West Scotland electoral regions. == Constituencies and council areas == === 2011– === As a result of the First Periodic Review of Scottish Parliament Boundaries the boundaries of the region and constituencies were redrawn for the 2011 Scottish Parliament election. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !bgcolor=\"#ff9999\"|Map !bgcolor=\"#ff9999\"|Constituency |- | center|350px | valign=\"top\"| # Argyll and Bute # Caithness, Sutherland and Ross # Inverness and Nairn # Moray # Na h-Eileanan an Iar # Orkney # Shetland # Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch |} === 1999–2011 === The constituencies were created in 1999 with the names and boundaries of Westminster constituencies, as existing at that time.Scottish Westminster constituencies were mostly replaced with new constituencies in 2005. See The 5th Periodical Report of the Boundary Commission for Scotland . They covered all of four council areas,Council areas are as defined in 1996, and were changed after the 2007 Scottish Parliament election. the Highland council area, Na h-Eileanan Siar (Western Isles council area), the Orkney Isles council area and the Shetland Isles council area, and most of two others, the Argyll and Bute council area and the Moray council area: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !bgcolor=\"#ff9999\"|Map !bgcolor=\"#ff9999\"|Constituency |- | center|350px | valign=\"top\"| # Argyll and Bute covers most of the Argyll and Bute council area. # Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross covers a northern portion of the Highland council area. # Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber covers a southern portion of the Highland council area. # Moray covers most of the Moray council area. # Orkney covers the Orkney Isles council area. # Ross, Skye and Inverness West covers a central portion of the Highland council area. # Shetland covers the Shetland Isles council area. # Western Isles covers Na h-Eileanan Siar. |} A south-eastern portion of the Argyll and Bute area is covered by the Dumbarton constituency, which is in the West of Scotland region. An eastern portion of the Moray area is covered by the Gordon constituency, in the North East Scotland region. ===Boundary changes=== The Boundary Commission also recommended changes to the electoral regions used to elect \"list\" members of the Scottish Parliament.
