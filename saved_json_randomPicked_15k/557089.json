Galmudug is a federal state in central Somalia. Jubaland is a federal state in the south of Somalia. In November 2014, the South West State of Somalia was established as a Somali federal state. In October 2016, a formation conference was launched in order to form the Hirshabelle State as a Somali federal state. The Federal Parliament is tasked with selecting the ultimate number and boundaries of the autonomous regional states (officially, Federal Member States) within the Federal Republic of Somalia. To this end, the legislature in December 2014 passed a law establishing the Boundary and Federalization Commission. The body is mandated with determining the boundaries of the country's constituent Federal Member States, as well as arbitrating between these regional states on their respective jurisdiction. ==Federal member states== As of 2016, Somalia is officially divided into 6 federal member states, including the claimed but uncontrolled Somaliland:http://somalireview.com/2016/10/somalias-regional- states-submit-upper-house-nominations/ *Galmudug *Hirshabelle *Jubaland *Puntland *South West ==Regions== President of Somalia Mohamed Siad Barre established five of these regions in 1974–75 for political reasons: Middle Juba, Lower Juba, Gedo, Bay, and Bakool; Banaadir shrank to Mogadishu city only at the same time.Mukhtar, 2011, p.48 Below are the regions of Somalia, along with their capitals shown in brackets: * Bakool (Hudur) * Banadir (Mogadisho) * Bari (Bosaso) * Bay (Baidoa) * Galgaduud (Dhusamareb) * Gedo (Garbahaarreey) * Hiiraan (Beledweyn) * Lower Juba (Kismayo) * Lower Shabelle (Merca) – established in 1984 * Middle Juba (Bu'ale) * Middle Shebelle (Jowhar) * Mudug (Galkayo) * Nugal (Garowe) * Claimed but uncontrolled (parts of Somaliland): ** Awdal ** Maroodi Jeex (as Woqooyi Galbeed) ** Sahil (as Woqooyi Galbeed) ** Sanaag ** Sool ** Togdheer == Somaliland == thumb|Map of the Republic of Somaliland The Republic of Somaliland functions as a de facto independent country with limited recognition that is located in the north of the Horn of Africa, adjacent to the Federal Republic of Somalia, which claims Somaliland as its territory.
