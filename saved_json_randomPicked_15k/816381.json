 "text": "Jonathan Dermot Spence (11 August 1936 – 25 December 2021) was an English-born American historian, sinologist, and writer specialising in Chinese history. He was Sterling Professor of History at Yale University from 1993 to 2008. His most widely read book is The Search for Modern China, a survey of the last several hundred years of Chinese history based on his popular course at Yale. A prolific author, reviewer, and essayist, he published more than a dozen books on China. Spence's major interest was modern China, especially the Qing dynasty, and relations between China and the West.Roberts, Priscilla \"Spence, Jonathan D.\" pages 1136–1137 from The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing edited by Kelly Boyd, Volume 2, London:Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, 1999 page 1136. Spence frequently used biographies to examine cultural and political history. Another common theme is the efforts of both Westerners and Chinese \"to change China\",Jonathan D. Spence To Change China; Western Advisers in China, 1620–1960. Boston: Little Brown, 1969 and how such efforts were frustrated. == Early life == Spence was born on 11 August 1936 to Muriel ( Crailsham) and Dermot Spence in Surrey in England. His mother was a French researcher while his father worked at an art gallery and a publishing house. Spence was educated at Winchester College and at Clare College, Cambridge and graduated in 1954. He spent two years in the military after graduating and was deployed in Germany during this period. He received his BA in history from Cambridge in 1959, studying at Clare College, Cambridge. During this time he was the editor of the campus magazine and was also the co- editor of British literary magazine Granta. He went to Yale University on a Clare-Mellon Fellowship to study the history and culture of China, receiving an MA and then a PhD in 1965, when he won the John Addison Porter Prize. As part of his graduate training, he spent a year in Australia to study under Fang Chao-ying and Tu Lien-che, scholars of the Qing dynasty.Frederic E. Wakeman Jr., Jonathan D. Spence at American Historical Association website (retrieved 10 March 2010). ==Career== Spence taught a popular undergraduate class at Yale University on the history of modern China, which formed the basis for his book The Search for Modern China (1989). He taught for more than 40 years at the university. During this time he wrote many books on China that furthered the understanding of the country and its culture with western audiences. Some of his books during this period included The Search for Modern China (1990), which was published on the back of the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, and God's Chinese Son: The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom of Hong Xiuquan (1996). Spence was president of the American Historical Association between 2004 and 2005. While his primary focus was on Qing dynasty China, he also wrote a biography of Mao Zedong and The Gate of Heavenly Peace, a study of twentieth-century intellectuals and their relation to revolution. He retired from Yale in 2008. His book The Search for Modern China was a New York Times best seller and documented the evolution of China starting from the decline of the Ming dynasty in the early 1600s to the pro-democracy movement of 1989, while his book Treason by the Book (2001) documented the story of a scholar who took on the third Manchu Emperor in the 1700s. ===Honors=== Spence received eight honorary degrees in the United States as well as from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and (in 2003) from Oxford University. He was invited to become a visiting professor at Peking University and an honorary professor at Nanjing University. He was named Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 2001, and in 2006, he was elected an Honorary Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge. He received the William C. DeVane Medal of the Yale Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa (1952); a Guggenheim Fellowship (1979); the Los Angeles Times History Prize (1982), and the Vursel Prize of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters (1983). He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1985), named a MacArthur Fellow (1988), appointed to the Council of Scholars of the Library of Congress (1988), elected a member of the American Philosophical Society (1993), and named a corresponding fellow of the British Academy (1997). In May and June 2008, he gave the 60th anniversary Reith Lectures, which were broadcast on BBC Radio 4. In 2010, Spence was appointed to deliver the annual Jefferson Lecture at the Library of Congress, the US federal government's highest honour for achievement in the humanities.Jill Laster, \"Eminent China Scholar Will Deliver 2010 Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities\", Chronicle of Higher Education, 8 March 2010. == Criticism == Spence has been criticised for describing Mao Zedong as one of the 20th century's Great Leaders.Mark Tarrant,'CCP holocaust Day Should Be Commemorated on October 1: A Proposal' https://bitterwinter.org/ccp-holocaust-day-should-be-commemorated-on- october-1/ ==Personal life== Spence's name in Chinese, (pinyin: Shǐ Jǐngqiān), was given to him by Fang Chao-ying to reflect his love of history and admiration for the Han dynasty historian Sima Qian. He chose the surname 史 (Shǐ; literally \"history\") and personal name (Jǐngqiān), where (jǐng) means admire (as in ) and (qiān) was taken from the personal name of Sima Qian (). Spence became an American citizen in 2000.Skinner, David (2010). Jonathan Spence Biography, National Endowment for the Humanities. Retrieved 14 September 2014. Spence's wife Annping Chin was a senior lecturer in history at Yale with a PhD in Chinese thought from Columbia.
