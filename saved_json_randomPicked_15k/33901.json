Yale University withdrew from the WIYN consortium on April 1, 2014, and was replaced by the University of Missouri in the fall of that year. In 2015, a NASA-NSF partnership called NN-EXPLORE effectively took over NOAO's share, although NOAO still manages the operations.WIYN.org: WIYN Observatory Members, Retrieved February 22, 2020 Purdue University joined in 2017 for a three-year period.Purdue.edu: Purdue Department Joins WIYN Consortium December 15, 2016, Retrieved February 22, 2020 The consortium operates two telescopes of 3.5 m and 0.9 m diameters. The universities financed the construction of the WIYN Observatory at Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) in 1994. In 2001, the WIYN Consortium took over control of the KPNO telescope, built in 1960, and rechristened it as the WIYN 0.9 m Telescope. This small but popular telescope was in danger of being mothballed for budgetary reasons. ==References== ==External links== *WIYN Consortium - official site Category:Astronomy institutes and departments",
