Bridgman, a graduate of Stanford University, and former USN gunnery officer on a destroyer, received his doctorate from Stanford University in 1961 and spent his entire teaching career at the University of Washington. His particular area of expertise was modern European history. He was the recipient of the university's Distinguished Teaching Award in 1973. His popularity as a speaker earned him a position lecturing to the annual meeting of the UW Alumni Association from 1987 to 2002, and the alumni have rewarded his retirement by donating funds to endow the Jon Bridgman Professorship in History at the University of Washington.
