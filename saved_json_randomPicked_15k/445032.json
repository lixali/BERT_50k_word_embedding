 "text": "In geometry, an icosagon or 20-gon is a twenty-sided polygon. The sum of any icosagon's interior angles is 3240 degrees. ==Regular icosagon== The regular icosagon has Schläfli symbol , and can also be constructed as a truncated decagon, , or a twice-truncated pentagon, . One interior angle in a regular icosagon is 162°, meaning that one exterior angle would be 18°. The area of a regular icosagon with edge length is :A={5}t^2(1+\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{5+2\\sqrt{5}}) \\simeq 31.5687 t^2. In terms of the radius of its circumcircle, the area is :A=\\frac{5R^2}{2}(\\sqrt{5}-1); since the area of the circle is \\pi R^2, the regular icosagon fills approximately 98.36% of its circumcircle. ==Uses== The Big Wheel on the popular US game show The Price Is Right has an icosagonal cross-section. The Globe, the outdoor theater used by William Shakespeare's acting company, was discovered to have been built on an icosagonal foundation when a partial excavation was done in 1989.Muriel Pritchett, University of Georgia \"To Span the Globe\" , see also Editor's Note, retrieved on 10 January 2016 As a golygonal path, the swastika is considered to be an irregular icosagon. 160px A regular square, pentagon, and icosagon can completely fill a plane vertex. ===Construction=== As , regular icosagon is constructible using a compass and straightedge, or by an edge-bisection of a regular decagon, or a twice-bisected regular pentagon: {| class=wikitable |350px Construction of a regular icosagon |350px Construction of a regular decagon |} == The golden ratio in an icosagon == * In the construction with given side length the circular arc around with radius , shares the segment in ratio of the golden ratio. :\\frac{\\overline{ E_{20}E_1}}{\\overline{E_1 F}} = \\frac{\\overline{E_{20} F}}{\\overline{ E_{20}E_1}} = \\frac{1+ \\sqrt{5}}{2} =\\varphi \\approx 1.618 == Symmetry== thumb|360px|Symmetries of a regular icosagon. Vertices are colored by their symmetry positions. Blue mirrors are drawn through vertices, and purple mirrors are drawn through edge. Gyration orders are given in the center. The regular icosagon has symmetry, order 40. There are 5 subgroup dihedral symmetries: , and , and 6 cyclic group symmetries: , and (. These 10 symmetries can be seen in 16 distinct symmetries on the icosagon, a larger number because the lines of reflections can either pass through vertices or edges. John Conway labels these by a letter and group order.John H. Conway, Heidi Burgiel, Chaim Goodman-Strauss, (2008) The Symmetries of Things, (Chapter 20, Generalized Schaefli symbols, Types of symmetry of a polygon pp. 275-278) Full symmetry of the regular form is and no symmetry is labeled . The dihedral symmetries are divided depending on whether they pass through vertices ( for diagonal) or edges ( for perpendiculars), and when reflection lines path through both edges and vertices. Cyclic symmetries in the middle column are labeled as for their central gyration orders. Each subgroup symmetry allows one or more degrees of freedom for irregular forms. Only the subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can seen as directed edges. The highest symmetry irregular icosagons are , an isogonal icosagon constructed by ten mirrors which can alternate long and short edges, and , an isotoxal icosagon, constructed with equal edge lengths, but vertices alternating two different internal angles. These two forms are duals of each other and have half the symmetry order of the regular icosagon. == Dissection== {| class=wikitable align=right |+ 20-gon with 180 rhombs |- align=center |160px regular |160px Isotoxal |} Coxeter states that every zonogon (a -gon whose opposite sides are parallel and of equal length) can be dissected into parallelograms.Coxeter, Mathematical recreations and Essays, Thirteenth edition, p.141 In particular this is true for regular polygons with evenly many sides, in which case the parallelograms are all rhombi. For the icosagon, , and it can be divided into 45: 5 squares and 4 sets of 10 rhombs. This decomposition is based on a Petrie polygon projection of a 10-cube, with 45 of 11520 faces. The list enumerates the number of solutions as 18,410,581,880, including up to 20-fold rotations and chiral forms in reflection. {| class=wikitable |+ Dissection into 45 rhombs |- align=center valign=top |140px 10-cube |160px |160px |160px |160px |} ==Related polygons== An icosagram is a 20-sided star polygon, represented by symbol .
