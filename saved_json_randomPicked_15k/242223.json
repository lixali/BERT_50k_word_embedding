Originally a separate township, this is now another suburb of Kuta. This area is very popular with resident expatriates; land and accommodation prices are amongst the highest in Bali. Plenty of luxury spas and hotels abound. Owing to its high density of high-end shopping, combined with the clustering of many fine eating establishments, it has rapidly become one of the most well-known tourist areas on the island. In addition to a few commercial strips with popular and lively restaurants, bars, villas, and good crafts/furniture shops, there are a few notable establishments: Ku DÃ© Ta, which is a bar/restaurant with a cult following based on its beach side/semi- resort atmosphere that has earned it the title of number one party spot in various magazines, and Oberoi, which is an expensive hotel with a worldwide reputation. Jalan Raya Seminyak (more often referred to as Jalan Legian), runs parallel with the beach, bisecting the district and acts as its main road artery. == See also == *Jalan Legian == References == == External links == * A Bali Beach Worth a Stay - NY Times Article on Seminyak - Feb 22, 2004 * Category:Beaches of Bali Category:Populated places in Bali Category:Shopping districts and streets in Indonesia Category:Badung Regency",
