 "text": "Interstate 474 (I-474) is an Interstate Highway loop route that provides a southwestern bypass around the north central Illinois city of Peoria. I-474's parent interstate is I-74. As the first digit of the interstate's number is even, it follows the established convention of providing a loop around a city. Interstate 474 is long. I-474 is the highest numbered route in the state of Illinois. It is also, excluding the proposed I-274 in North Carolina, the only auxiliary route of I-74. == Route description == Interstate 474 is a modern, Interstate-standard four-lane freeway for its entire length. Prior to 2006, thru truck traffic on I-74 was instructed to use I-474. This is because prior to its 2004-2007 reconstruction, Interstate 74 was significantly below Interstate standard, having numerous onramps and offramps, extremely short merging space for onramps (some less than 500 feet (152 m) in length), The Illinois Route 116 access interchange at Maxwell Road has been indicated as the eastern terminus for the Quincy to Peoria expressway now known as the Illinois Route 336 project.Illinois Department of Transportation.

The now-named Shade-Lohmann Bridge was erected in 1973. During that year, $30.1 million was allocated for acquisition of right-of-way, grading work and overpass/bridge construction across the whole length of the highway. == Exit list == == References == == External links == * Illinois Highway Ends: Interstate 474 74-4 74-4 Category:Transportation in Peoria County, Illinois Category:Transportation in Tazewell County, Illinois 4",
