 "text": "The 15th Golden Raspberry Awards were held on March 26, 1995, at the El Rey Hotel in Los Angeles, California, to recognize the worst the movie industry had to offer in 1994. Erotic thriller Color of Night became the first (and so far only) Golden Raspberry Worst Picture \"winner\" to not receive a single other Razzie (out of eight other nominations). Thumbelina became the first animated film to be nominated for and win a Razzie, which it received for Worst Original Song. The Specialist, Wyatt Earp, The Flintstones and Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult each took home two awards, even though the latter two were not nominated for Worst Picture. ==Awards and nominations== File:Steven Seagal by Gage Skidmore.jpg|Steven Seagal, Worst Director winner.
