 "text": "Harvest Records is a British-American record label belonging to Capitol Music Group, originally created by EMI in 1969. ==History== Harvest Records was created by EMI in 1969 to market progressive rock music, and to compete with Philips' Vertigo and Decca's Deram labels, and the independent Island label. Harvest was initially under the direction of Malcolm Jones, and was distributed in North America by EMI's US affiliate, Capitol Records. They were the European licensee for the American label Blue Thumb Records from 1969 to 1971. In the 1970s, the label primarily released progressive rock recordings by British acts including Pink Floyd, Syd Barrett, Kevin Ayers, The Move, Roy Wood, Barclay James Harvest, Be Bop Deluxe and Deep Purple. Most acts on the Harvest roster were British; two notable exceptions were Australian progressive band Spectrum (whose first two LPs were issued on Harvest) and Spectrum's successor Ariel, whose first two LPs also came out on the label. The Danish musician Sebastian had three albums released in Denmark on the Harvest label between 1972 and 1974. The focus of the label changed slightly as the 1970s drew to a close, with the signing of post-punk groups Wire, Australian band the Saints and the Banned. New wave artists Thomas Dolby and Duran Duran released their debut albums on the label in North America. Australian band Little River Band and English heavy metal band Iron Maiden's first three albums were also released in the US by the label. Pink Floyd switched to Columbia Records in the US after the release of The Dark Side of the Moon in 1973. In the United States, Capitol initially treated Harvest as a separate label that they expected big sales from. After only a few issues, they had few sales to show for their effort and consequently only issued a few releases and numbered them within their standard Capitol LP series (mostly using Harvest for Pink Floyd releases). After this initial short-lived series, Capitol passed on most of the UK Harvest artists. In 1975, a reissue sub-label was launched called Harvest Heritage. This new label largely compiled material that had been previously released on Harvest from 1969 onward. However, Harvest Heritage also reissued music from late 1960s EMI bands that had never recorded for the label, such as the Gods, Love Sculpture and Tomorrow. Heritage also occasionally released new music, such as Four Rock 'n' Roll Legends, a recording of a 1977 concert by rockabilly veterans Charlie Feathers, Buddy Knox, Jack Scott and Warren Smith. Most of Harvest's European back catalog (including Pink Floyd [see exception below], Deep Purple [pre-1971], Duran Duran, and Iron Maiden) were divested by Universal after its takeover of EMI, as part of the Parlophone Label Group. Warner Music Group would buy that part of the catalog in February 2013. Pink Floyd Records controls the Pink Floyd catalog which licensed the catalog for manufacture and distribution by Warner Music Group for the UK and European markets and by Sony Music Entertainment for North America and the rest of the world. Capitol Music Group announced its relaunch of the label on 25 February 2013, with former Warner Bros. Records and Dangerbird Records executive Piero Giramonti at the helm. Giramonti is tasked with running the label as an independent label, with the support of Capitol Music Group and Caroline Distribution for distribution, radio promotion and licensing. As of 2013, the Harvest roster consists of TV on the Radio, Arthur Beatrice, Babes, Banks, Death Grips, the Olms, Together Pangea, White Lies and Young & Sick. On 15 January 2014, it was announced that Morrissey, and Charlotte OC, had signed to Harvest Records. ==Discography== ;1969 * Deep Purple – The Book of Taliesyn * Pete Brown and His Battered Ornaments – A Meal You Can Shake Hands with in the Dark * Panama Limited Jug Band – Panama Limited Jug Band * Shirley and Dolly Collins – Anthems in Eden * Michael Chapman – Rainmaker * Third Ear Band – Alchemy * Edgar Broughton Band – Wasa Wasa * The Battered Ornaments – Mantle-Piece * Deep Purple – Deep Purple * Forest – Forest * Tea & Symphony – An Asylum for the Musically Insane * Bakerloo – Bakerloo * Kevin Ayers – Joy of a Toy * Pink Floyd – Ummagumma ;1970 * Various Artists – Picnic – A Breath of Fresh Air (Sampler) * Michael Chapman – Fully Qualified Survivor * Syd Barrett – The Madcap Laughs * Roy Harper – Flat Baroque and Berserk * Ron Geesin & Roger Waters - Music from The Body * Deep Purple – Concerto for Group and Orchestra * Pete Brown & Piblokto! – Things May Come and Things May Go but the Art School Dance Goes on Forever * Greatest Show on Earth – Horizons * Barclay James Harvest – Barclay James Harvest * Shirley and Dolly Collins – Love, Death and the Lady * Edgar Broughton Band – Sing Brother Sing * Third Ear Band – Third Ear Band * Pretty Things – Parachute * Quatermass – Quatermass * Kevin Ayers and the Whole World – Shooting at the Moon * Deep Purple – Deep Purple in Rock * Panama Limited – Indian Summer * Pink Floyd – Atom Heart Mother * Syd Barrett – Barrett * Pete Brown & Piblokto! – Thousands on a Raft * The Greatest Show on Earth – The Going's Easy * Love – Out Here * Forest – Full Circle * Tea & Symphony – Jo Sago A Play on Music * Michael Chapman – Window * Dave Mason – Alone Together * Chris Spedding- Backwood Progression ;1971 * Various Artists - The Harvest Bag (Special Budget Sampler) * Love – False Start * Barclay James Harvest – Once Again * Roy Harper – Stormcock * The Grease Band – The Grease Band * Edgar Broughton Band – Edgar Broughton Band * East of Eden – East of Eden * The Move - Message from the Country * Deep Purple – Fireball * Barclay James Harvest – Barclay James Harvest & Other Short Stories * Pink Floyd – Meddle * East of Eden – New Leaf * Electric Light Orchestra – The Electric Light Orchestra * Michael Chapman – Wrecked Again * Southern Comfort – Southern Comfort ;1972 * Babe Ruth - First Base * Janus - Gravedigger * Kevin Ayers – Whatevershebringswesing * Pink Floyd – Obscured by Clouds * Sebastian – Den store flugt * Spontaneous Combustion – Spontaneous Combustion * Edgar Broughton Band – Inside Out * Spontaneous Combustion – Triad * Barclay James Harvest – Baby James Harvest ;1973 * Kayak – See See the Sun * Roy Wood – Boulders * Pink Floyd – The Dark Side of the Moon * Electric Light Orchestra – ELO 2 * Kevin Ayers – Bananamour * Roy Harper – Lifemask * Mark-Almond – Rising * Edgar Broughton Band – Oora * Pink Floyd – Atom Heart Mother (Quadrophonic release) * Barclay James Harvest – Once Again (Quadrophonic release) * Ariel – A Strange Fantastic Dream * Sadistic Mika Band – Sadistic Mika Band * Sebastian – Over havet under himlen * Corben Simpson – Get Up With The Sun HSD 1030 * Wizzard – Wizzard Brew ;1974 * Babe Ruth – Amar Caballero * Be-Bop Deluxe – Axe Victim * Syd Barrett – Syd Barrett (Double reissue of The Madcap Laughs and Barrett) * Pink Floyd – A Nice Pair (Double reissue of The Piper at the Gates of Dawn and A Saucerful of Secrets) * Roy Harper – Flashes from the Archives of Oblivion * Sadistic Mika Band – Black Ship * Sebastian – Blød lykke * Triumvirat – Illusions on a Double Dimple * Kayak – Kayak II * Wizzard – See My Baby Jive (compilation) * The Move – California Man (compilation) * Electric Light Orchestra – Showdown (compilation) * The Frenchies - Lola Cola ;1975 * Pink Floyd – Wish You Were Here (Europe only) * Roy Harper – HQ * Be-Bop Deluxe – Futurama * Ariel – Rock 'n' Roll Scars * Edgar Broughton Band – A Bunch of 45s (Harvest Heritage compilation) * Quatermass – Quatermass (Harvest Heritage reissue) * Climax Blues Band – 1969 – 1972 (Harvest Heritage compilation) * Greatest Show on Earth – Greatest Show on Earth (Harvest Heritage compilation) * The Pretty Things – S.F.
