 "text": "Chiniquodon is an extinct genus of carnivorous cynodonts, which lived during the Late Triassic (Carnian) in South America (Argentina and Brazil) and Africa (Namibia and Madagascar). Chiniquodon was closely related to the genus Aleodon, and close to the ancestry of mammals. Other contemporaries included early dinosaurs. As both groups filled a similar ecological niche, fairly large therapsid hunters such as Chiniquodon may have been outcompeted by dinosaurs. == Classification == thumb|left|Life reconstruction of C. theotonicus Chiniquodon theotonicus, the type species, is from the Santa Maria Formation, Brazil and Chañares Formation, Ischigualasto-Villa Unión Basin, northwestern Argentina. This species is known from a number of skulls. The holotype is in the paleontological collection at Tübingen University, Germany. Chiniquodon sanjuanensis is from the Cancha de Bochas Member of the Ischigualasto Formation, Ischigualasto-Villa Unión Basin, northwestern Argentina. It was originally assigned to the genus Probelesodon, but was reassigned to this genus in 2002. It is differentiated from C. theotonicus because of its teeth and the shape of the zygomatic process. Chiniquodon kalanoro is from the Isalo II Formation, Madagascar. This species is known from a mandible (holotype UA 10607). Chiniquodon omaruruensis is from the Omingonde Formation of Namibia. It is known from a single specimen (GSN F315), consisting of a complete skull and parts of the postcranial skeleton. == References == == Further reading == * Von Huene.
