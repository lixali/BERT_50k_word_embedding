 "text": "Hypnotize Minds is an American record label created by DJ Paul and Juicy J of Three 6 Mafia in 1997, in Memphis, Tennessee. The label serves as the successor to Three 6 Mafia's previous label, Prophet Entertainment, which was co-founded by DJ Paul and Juicy J along with Nicholas ‘Nick Scarfo’ Jackson in 1991. Hypnotize Minds was created after DJ Paul and Juicy J had a disagreement with Jackson, which led to Three 6 Mafia and several other artists previously on the Prophet label to move to the new Hypnotize Minds imprint. As a group act, Hypnotize Minds goes by the stage name Hypnotize Camp Posse. The label has been assumed defunct since 2012 in conjuncture with Three 6 Mafia's hiatus, with the Lil Wyte album Still Doubted? (released on June 19, 2012) being the label's last release. == Notable artists == *DJ Paul (1997-2012) co- owner *Juicy J (1997–2012) co-owner *Lord Infamous (1997-2005) *Koopsta Knicca (1997-2000) *Crunchy Black (1997-2006) *Gangsta Boo (1997-2001) *Project Pat (1997-2012) *La Chat (1997-2002) *Indo G (1997-1998) *Mr. Del (1998-2000) *Frayser Boy (2001-2009) *Lil Wyte (2002-2012) *Young Buck (2000) ==Discography== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |+List of studio albums, with selected chart positions and certifications !
