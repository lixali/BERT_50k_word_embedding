 "text": "Radio Amateurs of Canada (RAC), known in French as Radio Amateurs du Canada, is the national association for Amateur Radio in Canada. It is a not-for- profit membership association with headquarters in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, representing the interests of Amateur Radio all across Canada. Speaking on behalf of Canadian Radio Amateurs, RAC provides liaison with government agencies and carries the Amateur voice about regulatory and spectrum issues to the discussion table with government and industry leaders, nationally and internationally. RAC is the Canadian voting member society of the International Amateur Radio Union. RAC also provides many services, publications and supplies to its members to enhance their enjoyment of Amateur Radio. The organization publishes a bimonthly magazine distributed to members called The Canadian Amateur. ==History== * 1967 — Canadian Amateur Radio Federation (CARF) formed * 1979 — Canadian Radio Relay League (CRRL) formed out of the Canadian Division of the American Radio Relay League. * 1993 — Merger of Canadian Radio Relay League with Canadian Amateur Radio Federation to form Radio Amateurs of Canada, Inc. ==Regulatory advocacy== Radio Amateurs of Canada represents all Canadian Amateurs at all levels of government: 1) At the local level it works with municipalities on such issues as regulations governing the placement of antennas. It also assists Amateur Radio clubs and other organizations in Public Service and Emergency Services (ARES) functions throughout the year. RAC also provides assistance to members wishing to install antennas and towers following Industry Canada's (now called Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada) tower policy including CPC-2-0-03. 2) At the regional/provincial/territorial level it also works with governments on such issues as Distracted Driving Legislation and Emergency Services. 3) At the national level it represents all Amateurs on the Canadian Amateur Radio Advisory Board and works with Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada on important issues such as tower legislation, RF interference and spectrum grabs by business. 4) At the international level RAC is a member of the International Amateur Radio Union (IARU) which works with the UN’s International Telecommunication Union (ITU) [2] to preserve and expand our frequency spectrum allocations. RAC pays its IARU dues based on the total number of Amateurs in Canada, and not just RAC members so it needs the support of members. RAC also sponsors a representative at the World Radiocommunication Conferences in Geneva, Switzerland to protect existing spectrum and open new spectrum such as the recent allocation at 60 metres at WRC-15. It is expensive to send a representative to Geneva and RAC coordinates the Defence of the Amateur Radio Fund so that Amateurs can contribute to this cost. 5) And beyond...: RAC also supports the Amateur Radio on the International Space Station (ARISS) and provides opportunities for students to experience the thrill of communicating with astronauts on the International Space Station. The organization also acts as a consultatory body to municipal, provincial, and federal government bodies in matters concerning the Amateur Radio Service. ==Services== The Radio Amateur of Canada club offers programs and publications to \"promote excellence, the state of the art, and the interests of Amateur Radio's many varied activities\".
