There are several legends about the name. It was the site of a trading post and the site of battles in the American Indian Wars. It was also a locale of the Johnson County War. An FAA-operated VOR navigation beacon, named after this area, is located about seven miles (12 km) southeast of the creek. Crazy Woman VOR's FAA three-letter station designator is CZI. The creek that winds and twists for a long distance is large enough that it is broken into three sections, an upper, middle and lower section. ==External links and references== *travel-to-wyoming.com on Crazy Woman Creek *More on the battle *crazywomantradingco.com * Category:Rivers of Wyoming Category:Bodies of water of Johnson County, Wyoming",
