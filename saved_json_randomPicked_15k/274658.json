 "text": "Kalinga-Apayao was a province of the Philippines in the Cordillera Administrative Region in the island of Luzon. It was divided into two present provinces of Kalinga and Apayao with the passage of Philippine Republic Act No. 7878 on February 14, 1995. This RA amended the earlier Republic Act No. 4695, passed on June 18, 1966, which formed the provinces of Kalinga-Apayao, Benguet, Ifugao, and Mountain Province, from the earlier Mountain Province. As part of a cult of personality, long-time Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos made gradual changes to the borders of Kalinga-Apayao over the course of his rule with the aim of making the outline of the province, on a map, resemble the silhouette of his own head, facing towards his own native province of Ilocos Norte. The plan was unfinished when Marcos was overthrown in 1986. ==References== Category:Former provinces of the Philippines Category:States and territories established in 1966 Category:1966 establishments in the Philippines Category:1995 disestablishments in the Philippines Category:History of Kalinga (province) Category:History of Apayao",
