 "text": "Alphitomancy (from Greek ἄλφιτον alphiton, 'barley', and μαντεία manteia, 'divination') is a form of divination involving barley cakes or loaves of barley bread. When someone in a group was suspected of a crime, the members of the group would be fed barley cakes or slices of barley bread. Supposedly, the guilty party would get indigestion, while all others would feel well. ==See also== * Corsned * Alphito * Crithomancy ==References== Category:Divination Category:Breads",
