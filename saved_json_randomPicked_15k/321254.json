 "text": "The president of Slovenia, officially the President of the Republic of Slovenia (), is the head of state of the Republic of Slovenia. It was established on 23 December 1991 when the National Assembly passed a new Constitution as a result of independence from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. According to the Constitution, the president is the highest representative of the state. In practice, the position is mostly ceremonial. Among other things, the president is also the commander-in-chief of the Slovenian Armed Forces. The office of the president is the Presidential Palace in Ljubljana. The president is directly elected by universal adult suffrage for a term of five years. Any Slovenian citizen can run for President, but can hold only two consecutive terms in office. The president has no legally guaranteed immunity and may be impeached. == List of presidents of Slovenia == === Socialist Republic of Slovenia === Parties; {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center; margin-bottom:0\" |- ! ! width=180|Name !
