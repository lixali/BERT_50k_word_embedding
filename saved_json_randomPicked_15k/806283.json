Olsten Corporation was founded in 1946 by William Olsten. The company grew through the 50s, 60s, and 70s, and in 1971, it began focusing on its health care division under the name Olsten Healthcare. In the 90s its health care division began acquiring other companies. The division acquired Upjohn Health Services, and after an acquisition of Lifetime Corporation, which included Office Angels, it became the largest provider of home healthcare services, operating as Olsten Kimberly QualityCare. In 1995 Olsten Kimberly QualityCare launched CareCentrix, and a year later, the company entered the home infusion business by acquiring Quantum Health Resources. That same year it acquired NeuroCare Rehab Without Walls, and became the sole national provider for Cigna HealthCare. It also acquired Nurses House Call, and in 1997, it changed its name to Olsten Health Services. In 1999, Olsten Corporation split its healthcare division into an independent, publicly traded company, named Gentiva Health Services. In its first three years of independent operation, Gentiva launched its Gentiva Orthopedics, Gentiva Cardiopulmonary, and Safe Strides programs, it also sold its pharmaceutical services division to Accredo Health Inc. It also sold its health care staffing unit to InteliStaf Holdings Inc. and the Carlyle Group. By 2010, it had acquired First HomeCare of Houston, Heritage Home Care Services, The Healthfield Group, Gilbert's Home Health and Hospice, Physicians Home Health Care and Hospice of Charleston. In 2008, it launched its Neurorehabilitation and Senior Health programs. In 2009, Gentiva moved its headquarters from Melville, New York to Atlanta, Georgia. In that same year, it acquired Mid-State Home Health, Magna Home Health, and Medicare-Certified offices of Coordinated Home HealthCare. In 2011, the company sold its majority stake in CareCentrix to Water Street Healthcare Partners. Also in 2011, the company closed or divested 34 home health branches and 9 hospice branches. It also sold its IDOA business to Premier Home Health Care Services, acquired Odyssey Healthcare of Augusta, and sold its Rehab Without Walls business to Southern Home Care Services. Its $1 billion purchase of Odyssey Healthcare was the largest hospice acquisition in U.S. history. In 2012, it acquired Advocate Hospice, Family Home Care Corporation and North Mississippi Hospice. In October 2013, the company acquired Harden Healthcare Holdings and Hope Hospice. On October 9, 2014, Kindred Healthcare, Inc. and Gentiva Health Services, Inc. announced that the companies entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Kindred would acquire all of the outstanding shares of Gentiva common stock. The agreement was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies. The transaction was valued at $1.8 billion, including the assumption of net debt.
