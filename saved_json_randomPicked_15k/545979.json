 "text": "The TI-86 is a programmable graphing calculator introduced in 1996 which was produced by Texas Instruments. The TI-86 uses the Zilog Z80 microprocessor. It is partially backwards-compatible with its predecessor, the TI-85. In addition to having a larger screen than the TI-83, the TI-86 also allows the user to type in lower case and Greek letters and features five softkeys, which improve menu navigation and can be programmed by the user for quick access to common operations such as decimal-to-fraction conversion. The calculator also handles vectors, matrices and complex numbers better than the TI-83. One drawback, however, is that the statistics package on the TI-83 range doesn't come preloaded on the TI-86. However, it can be downloaded from the Texas Instruments program archive and installed on the calculator using the link cable. (archived) The TI-86 has been discontinued. ==Specifications== *CPU: Zilog Z80 6 MHz *RAM: 128 KB, 96 KB user-accessible *ROM: 256 KB non- upgradable *Display: 128×64 pixels high-contrast monochrome LCD *Data Communication: Serial link port; allows two TI-86 calculators to be connected to each other, or one TI-86 to be connected to a PC, for data transfer via a special link cable *Programming Languages: TI-BASIC, Z80 Assembly language (ASM) ==See also== * Comparison of Texas Instruments graphing calculators ==References== ==External links== *Official Texas Instruments TI-86 page (Internet Archive) *ticalc.org hosts a large collection of downloadable freeware programs for the TI-86 can be found at along with programming tutorials and hardware extensions *CalcG.org - Very organized and large archive of games and programs. *The Guide - the largest set of tutorials for TI-86 assembly programming *Texas Instruments Program Archive (archived) *Complete Disassembly of a TI-86 Category:Graphing calculators Category:Texas Instruments programmable calculators Category:Products introduced in 1997 Category:Z80",
