 "text": "Shivini (), also known as Siuini, Artinis, Ardinis, was a solar god in the mythology of the Iron Age kingdom of Urartu in the Armenian Highlands. He is the third god in a triad with Khaldi and Theispas. The Assyrian god Shamash is a counterpart to Shivini. He was depicted as a man on his knees, holding up a solar disc. His wife was most likely a goddess called Tushpuea who is listed as the third goddess on the Mheri-Dur inscription. Armen Petrosyan and other scholars argue that his name derives from a Hittite source, and is, therefore, of Indo-European origin.Petrosyan, Armen. \"Collegiality and Interchange in Armenian Studies\".
