 "text": "The Telemax is a telecommunication tower built from 1988 to 1992 in Hanover. The tower was designed by Hans U. Boeckler and is metres (892 feet) high. The tower stands on a high base building, which brings its overall height to . The tower is the fifth tallest TV tower in Germany. The owner and operator of the site is Deutsche Funkturm (DFMG), a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom. ==Description== Originally a substantially slimmer round tower was planned. However, when the plans were submitted for approval, the inscription Model Hamburg was allegedly still written on the plan. It was decided that only a Model Hanover was appropriate for the state capital and thus the planning of the telecommunication tower had to begin again. There is no observation deck on the Telemax. The building is of architectural interest due to its square surfaces. In 1997, Boeckler received cement-steel prize Die Kunst des Bewehrens for the tower's truss structure. The Telemax is in the city's Buchholz-Kleefeld district, which is about from the city center. It can be seen from all over this part of the city, and is an obvious landmark. It can be seen from the highway from about away, from the A 2 near Lehrte, for example. The name of the previous radio tower in the city was changed to VW- Tower after this new tower went into service. The tower is illuminated in magenta, the corporate color of Deutsche Telekom AG, for special occasions, such as the Hannover Messe or CeBit. ==See also== *List of towers *List of masts ==External links== Category:Towers completed in 1992 Category:Communication towers in Germany Category:Buildings and structures in Hanover Category:1992 establishments in Germany",
