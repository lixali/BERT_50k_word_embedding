Her father and mother are from the Pokot tribe, a Nilotic ethnic group inhabiting parts of northern Kenya, eastern Uganda and southern Ethiopia.Tegla Loroupe gives Refugee Olympians A Lesson in Hope, Jere Longmam. 4 August 2016, NYTimes, Retrieved 11 September 2016 Loroupe was told by her father that she was useless and her career might be babysitting. She grew up with 24 siblings. The Pokots being a polygamous culture, her father had four wives. She spent her childhood working fields, tending cattle and looking after younger brothers and sisters. At the age of six, Loroupe started school at Kapsait Elementary school; she had to run ten kilometres to and from school every morning. At school, she became aware of her potential as an athlete when she won races held over a distance of 800 or 1500 metres against much older students. She decided to pursue a career as a runner. However, except for her mother, she was not supported by anyone. The Kenyan athletics federation, Athletics Kenya, did not support her at first, thinking Loroupe too small and too thin.

She began to train to compete internationally the following year, earning her first pair of running shoes in 1989, which she wore only for particularly rough races. She was nominated for the junior race of the 1989 IAAF World Cross Country Championships finishing 28th.
