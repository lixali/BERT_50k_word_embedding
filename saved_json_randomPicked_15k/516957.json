 "text": "The Jaguar XK150 is a sports car produced by Jaguar between 1957 and 1961 as the successor to the XK140. Initially it was only available in fixed head coupé (FHC) and drophead coupé (DHC) versions. The roadster without full weather equipment which had begun the XK line was launched as the XK150 OTS (open two-seater) in 1958. Minimal rear seats were fitted in the coupés. The open two-seater was fitted for the first time with wind-up windows in taller high-silled doors, but retained the very simple folding roof of its predecessors. == History == Announced in its home market in May 1957Jaguar. The Times, Wednesday, 22 May 1957; pg. 7; Issue 53847 the XK150 bore a family resemblance to the XK120 and XK140 but was radically revised. Most visibly, a one-piece windscreen replaced the split screen, and the wing line carried higher and more streamlined at the doors. The widened bonnet opened down to the wings, and on the coupés the windscreen frame was moved forward to make passenger access easier. The car was available at various times in Red, Pearl Grey, White, Indigo Blue, Claret, Cotswold Blue, Black, Mist Grey, Sherwood Green, Carmen Red, British Racing Green, Cornish Grey, and Imperial Maroon. The XK150's dashboard came trimmed in leather, with walnut optional on all models. On the early drophead coupés, the aluminium centre dash panel, which was discontinued after June 1958, had an X pattern engraving similar to the early 3.8 E-Type. Thinner doors gave more interior space. A little red light reminded the driver that the front parking lights, located atop the wings (fenders), were on. Suspension and chassis were very similar to the XK140, with manual-only rack and pinion steering. The 3.4 litre DOHC straight-6 XK engine was similar to the XK140's, but a new \"B\" type cylinder head raised power to 180 SAE bhp at 5750 rpm. The first closed and convertible XK150s were slower than their predecessors. After a twelve-month delay caused by the February 1957 factory fire, this deficit was corrected in the spring of 1958 with the March release of special equipment models fitted with disc brakes and more powerful SE engine. Twin SU HD6 carburettors and a modified B type cylinder head with larger exhaust valves improved performance to 210 SAE bhp at 5500 rpm. While most export cars were SE models, a third option for the open two-seater featured an \"S\" engine with three SU HD8 carburettors and a straight-port cylinder head boosting power to a claimed 250 SAE bhp.140 M.P.H.

Four-wheel Dunlop disc brakes appeared for the first time as an option.

It had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0– in 7.8 seconds. Fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £2110 including taxes of £623. It was at the time the fastest closed car the magazine had ever subjected to a full road test. The bhp figures quoted are SAE gross and not SAE net horsepower ratings. In comparison, the 3.4L 1954 Jaguar 'D'-type with racing camshafts, larger 1.875in. inlet valves, and 3 dual-choke Weber carburettors was rated at 246 bhp.Autocar magazine 10 August 1967, Table 1 XK Engine comparisons == Coachbuilt version == === Jaguar XK150 By Bertone === A total of 3 bare chassis were sent to Bertone in Turin to be bodied as prototype fixed-head coupés. They were reportedly meant to be the replacement for the XK150 and wore an \"XKE\" badge on their rear flanks. Jaguar ended up replacing the XK150 with the E-Type.
