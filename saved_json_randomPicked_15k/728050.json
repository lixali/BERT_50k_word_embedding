Originally constructed in 1904 by Georgia Power to provide electricity for Atlanta's streetcars, it now provides enough power for about 4,400 homes. It was named for then recently deceased Georgia Power president S. Morgan Smith's mother whose maiden name was Morgan. At the time it was by far the largest hydroelectric plant in the state.Wright, Wade, The History of the Georgia Power Company, GPC, 1957, p.109 In 1924 it was rebuilt as a 60 cycle plant with 15,000 megawatts (up from the original 10,500 mW).Wright, Wade, The History of the Georgia Power Company, GPC, 1957, p.183 In 1957 it was raised to regulate the flow from the larger Buford Dam, upstream, in order to give Atlanta water during the hours it was needed most.Martin, Herald, Atlanta and Environs, Vol III, UGA Press, 1987, p.260 It is long, and tall. The dam's license from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) was issued in May 2008, and expires in February 2039 which authorizes a capacity of 16,800 mW. The construction of the dam changed the river upstream from a narrow river with rapids into a wetland. The wetland serves as a habitat for migrating birds, waterfowl, songbirds, beavers, muskrats, and numerous species of reptiles and amphibians.CNC on the River: A look into the trips down the Chattahoochee River with the Chattahoochee Nature Center (July 12, 2011).
