 "text": "In the mythology of Tonga, Ilaheva Vaepopua (Ilaheva, living at Vaepopua) was a mortal woman, the daughter of Seketoa. Seketo'a was either a chief of Tongatapu, or perhaps a god from Niuatoputapu, depending on the source. All accounts, however, agree that 'Ilaheva became the wife of Tangaloa Eitumātupua and mother of Ahoeitu, the first divine king of the Tui Tonga dynasty in Tonga, around 900 AD. == References == ==Further reading== * R.D.
