 "text": "A frequency plan, bandplan, band plan or wavelength plan is a plan for using a particular band of radio frequencies, that are a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Each frequency plan defines the frequency range to be included, how channels are to be defined, and what will be carried on those channels. Typical definitions set forth in a frequency plan are: *numbering scheme – which channel numbers or letters (if any) will be assigned *center frequencies – how far apart the carrier wave for each channel will be *bandwidth and/or deviation – how wide each channel will be *spectral mask – how extraneous signals will be attenuated by frequency *modulation – what type will be used or are permissible *content – what types of information are allowed, such as audio or video, analog or digital *licensing – what the procedure will be to obtain a broadcast license The actual authorized frequency bands are defined by the ITU and the local regulating agencies like the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the USA.For the authorized frequency bands for amateur radio use see: Authorized frequency bands. ==Notes== ==See also== *Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975 *Copenhagen Frequency Plan of 1948 *AM broadcasting *Amateur radio frequency allocations *Broadcasting *Cellular frequencies *FM broadcast band *Frequency allocation *Ham radio *Radio broadcasting Category:Amateur radio Category:Broadcast engineering Category:Radio resource management",
