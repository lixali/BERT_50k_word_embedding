 "text": "The position of Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs was a British cabinet- level position created in 1925 responsible for British relations with the Dominions -- Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Newfoundland, and the Irish Free State — and the self-governing Crown colony of Southern Rhodesia. When initially created, the office was held in tandem with that of Secretary of State for the Colonies; this arrangement persisted until June 1930. On two subsequent occasions the offices were briefly held by the same person. The Secretary was supported by an Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. In 1947, the name of the office was changed to the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations. ==Secretaries of State for Dominion Affairs, 1925–1947== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:Center;\" ! colspan=9 | |- ! colspan=2| Portrait !
