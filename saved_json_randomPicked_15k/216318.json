The spacecraft docked with the ISS 2003-04-28 and undocked 2003-10-27. Soyuz TMA-2 was the second flight for the TMA modification of the Soyuz spacecraft, and the 6th Soyuz to fly to the ISS. The commander is Yuri Ivanovich Malenchenko (Russia), and flight engineer Edward Tsang Lu (USA), and after docking with the ISS they exchanged with the resident crew on ISS and became the seventh station crew, called \"ISS Expedition Seven\". Alexander Kaleri and Michael Foale were assigned as the backup crew. ==Crew== ==Original Crew== ==Mission parameters== *Mass: 7136 kg *Perigee: 200 km *Apogee: 250 km *Inclination: 51.7° *Period: 88.7 min ===Docking with ISS=== *Docked to ISS: April 28, 2003, 05:56 UTC (to nadir port of Zarya) *Undocked from ISS: October 27, 2003, 23:17 UTC (from nadir port of Zarya) ==Mission highlights== Originally the Soyuz missions to the ISS were all planned to be only taxi mission to deliver a new Soyuz spacecraft as the station's lifeboat every six month with a visiting crew, but not for crew exchange. Until the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster the same was planned for Soyuz TMA-2, a visiting crew consisting of commander Gennady Padalka and ESA-astronaut Pedro Duque were to spend about one week at the station and then return with the previous Soyuz TMA-1 spacecraft. The third seat might have gone to the Chilean Klaus von Storch as a Chilean space agency (Agencia Chilena del Espacio) cosmonaut, but even before the Columbia disaster it looked like his flight would not happen, and the seat would go to the Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kotov or to deliver freight to the station. thumb|left|Soyuz TMA-2 landing During his stay on the station, Malenchenko became the first person to get married in space. His bride was in Texas where long distance marriages are legal. The spacecraft returned to Earth on October 28, with both the \"Expedition 7\" crew as well as Pedro Duque on board. Duque was launched with Soyuz TMA-3 and spent only one week on board of the ISS. == References == ==External links== * RussianSpaceWeb.com: Soyuz TMA-2 * SpaceRef.com: Soyuz TMA-2/6S Lands On Target Category:Crewed Soyuz missions Category:Spacecraft launched in 2003 Category:Spacecraft which reentered in 2003 Category:Spacecraft launched by Soyuz-FG rockets",
