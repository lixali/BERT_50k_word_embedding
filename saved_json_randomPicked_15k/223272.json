All the sections are ruled by a single Presidium, which is formed by a president, a vice-president, a secretary, a vice-secretary and a treasurer: the king of Sweden is the Honorary President of the academy. ==Prizes== The prizes awarded by the academy are as follows: *Linnaeus prize: the oldest prize awarded by the Academy, named after Carl Linnaeus: the prize was instituted upon a donation by Linnaeus widow, Sara E.
