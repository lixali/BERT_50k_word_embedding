After World War II, he resumed his acting career in New York. In early 1948, he was selected by Elia Kazan to be a member in the recently formed Actors Studio. He appeared consistently in Broadway and off-Broadway plays, something he'd continue to do well into his screen acting career. Columnist Earl Wilson dubbed him \"The Bronx Barrymore\". In 1968, he won a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his performance in the 1967 Broadway production of You Know I Can't Hear You When the Water's Running. === Television === Balsam performed in several episodes of the studio's dramatic television anthology series, broadcast between September 1948 and 1950. He appeared in many other television drama series, including Decoy with Beverly Garland, The Twilight Zone (episodes \"The Sixteen Millimeter Shrine\" and \"The New Exhibit\"), as a psychologist in the pilot episode, Five Fingers, Target: The Corruptors!, The Eleventh Hour, Breaking Point, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, The Fugitive, and Mr. Broadway, as a retired U.N.C.L.E. agent in The Man from U.N.C.L.E. episode, \"The Odd Man Affair\", and guest-starred in the two-part Murder, She Wrote episode, \"Death Stalks the Big Top\". He also appeared in the Route 66 episode, \"Somehow It Gets To Be Tomorrow\". He played Dr. Rudy Wells when the Martin Caidin novel Cyborg was adapted as a TV-movie pilot for The Six Million Dollar Man (1973), though he did not reprise the role for the subsequent series. In 1975, he appeared as James Arthur Cummins in the Joe Don Baker police drama Mitchell, a film that was eventually featured in a highly popular episode of the comedy film-riffing series Mystery Science Theater 3000 in 1993. He appeared as a spokesman/hostage in the TV movie Raid on Entebbe (1976) and as a detective in the TVM Contract on Cherry Street (1977). He also appeared on an episode of Quincy ME. Balsam starred as Murray Klein on the All in the Family spin-off Archie Bunker's Place for two seasons (1979–81) and returned for a guest appearance in the show's fourth and final season. === Film === Balsam made his film debut with an uncredited role in On the Waterfront (1954), directed by his Actors' Studio colleague Elia Kazan. Balsam played an official of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey investigating mob involvement in the city's waterfront unions. His breakthrough role came a few years later, when he played Juror #1 in 12 Angry Men (1957). He would collaborate with the film's director, Sidney Lumet, twice more with The Anderson Tapes (1971) and Murder on the Orient Express (1974). In 1960, he appeared in one of his best-remembered roles as private investigator Arbogast in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. Along with Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum, Balsam appeared in both the original Cape Fear (1962), and the 1991 Martin Scorsese remake. He won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Arnold Burns in A Thousand Clowns (1965). Balsam also performed the original voice of the HAL 9000 computer in 2001: A Space Odyssey. After his lines were recorded, director Stanley Kubrick decided \"Marty just sounded a little bit too colloquially American,\" and hired Douglas Rain to perform the role for the released film. Balsam also appeared in such notable films as Time Limit, Breakfast at Tiffany's, The Carpetbaggers, Seven Days in May, Hombre, Catch-22, Tora! Tora! Tora! (as Admiral Husband E. Kimmel), Little Big Man, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, Mitchell, All the President's Men, The Delta Force, and The Goodbye People. One of his final acting appearances was in the 1994 horror parody The Silence of the Hams, which paid homage to his iconic role in Psycho. Beyond Hollywood, Balsam was also a popular character actor in Italian films, beginning in 1960 when he starred in the Luigi Comencini film Everybody Go Home. He would star in several poliziottesco films throughout the 1970s, directed by the likes of Fernando Di Leo and Enzo G. Castellari. Balsam's roles in these films would be re-dubbed into Italian, but he would loop his own lines in the English- language export versions. Balsam maintained close ties to Italy even after the end of the poliziottesco trend, traveling there for both professional and personal reasons, and starring in the Italian-produced television series Ocean and La piovra. == Personal life == In 1951, Balsam married his first wife, actress Pearl Somner. They divorced three years later. His second wife was actress Joyce Van Patten. This marriage lasted for four years (from 1958 until 1962) with one daughter, Talia Balsam. He married his third wife, Irene Miller, in 1963. They had two children, Adam and Zoe Balsam, and divorced in 1987. == Death == On February 13, 1996, Balsam died of a stroke in his hotel room while vacationing in Rome, Italy. He was 76 years old. He is interred at Cedar Park Cemetery, in Emerson, New Jersey. == Filmography == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! width=6%| Year ! width=20%| Title ! width=25%| Role ! class= \"unsortable\" | Notes |- | 1949 || Suspense || Abramson || |- | 1949–1950 || Actors Studio || Soldier || 4 episodes |- | 1950 || Danger || || 2 episodes |- | rowspan=3|1951 || The Living Christ Series || Innkeeper || Miniseries |- | The Big Story || Bill Pinney || |- | Frontiers of Faith || || |- | 1952 || The Living Bible || Nobleman || |- | rowspan=2|1953 || Man Against Crime || Tony / Jean Pinay || |- | Valiant Lady || Joey Gordon || |- | rowspan=3|1954 || On the Waterfront || Gillette, Secondary Investigator for Crime Commission || Uncredited |- | The Greatest Gift || Harold Matthews #2 || |- | Inner Sanctum Mystery || Wesley / Hanson / Larkin || 3 episodes |- | 1954–1955 || Philco Television Playhouse || Charlie Malick / Mike Galloway || 3 episodes |- | 1954–1956 || Goodyear Television Playhouse || Perkins / Walter Gregg || 3 episodes |- | 1955 || The United States Steel Hour || Petty Officer || |- | rowspan=2|1957 || 12 Angry Men || Juror #1 || |- | Time Limit || Sargeant Baker || |- | 1957–1958 || Studio One || Francis Toohey / Ed Coyne || 3 episodes |- | rowspan=6|1958 || Kraft Television Theatre || Dino || |- | Marjorie Morningstar || Dr. David Harris || |- | Father Knows Best || Teacher || |- | Pursuit || Holden || |- | Decoy || Nick Santos || |- | Alfred Hitchcock Presents || Leonard Thompson || |- | rowspan=2|1958–59 || Playhouse 90 || Sam Gordon / Captain Mantell || 3 episodes |- | Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse || Gambetta / Dr. Gillespie || 2 episodes |- | 1958–1960 || Have Gun – Will Travel || Marshall Jim Brock / Charles Dawes || 2 episodes |- | rowspan=9|1959 || Rawhide || Father Fabian || |- | Al Capone || Mac Keeley || |- | The Further Adventures of Ellery Queen || || 2 episodes |- | Middle of the Night || Jack || |- | Brenner || Arnold Joplin || |- | The DuPont Show of the Month || Charlie Davis || |- | Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater || Sam Butler || |- | Winterset || Garth || |- | The Twilight Zone || Danny Weiss || Episode: \"The Sixteen Millimeter Shrine\" |- | 1959–1962 || Naked City || Captain Russell Barris / Joseph Creeley / Caldwell Wyatt / Arnold Fleischman || 4 episodes |- | rowspan=6|1960 || Five Fingers || Monteverdi || |- | Goodyear Theater || Joe Lane || |- | The Robert Herridge Theater || || |- | Sunday Showcase || Nicola Sacco || |- | Psycho || Detective Arbogast || |- | Tutti a casa || Sergeant Quintino Fornaciari || |- | rowspan=7|1961 || Way Out || Bill Clayton || |- | Alfred Hitchcock Presents || Elon Marsh || |- | Ada || Steve Jackson || |- | Breakfast at Tiffany's || O.J.
