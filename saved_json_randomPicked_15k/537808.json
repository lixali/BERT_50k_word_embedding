 "text": "The National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics Women's Basketball National Championship has been held annually since 1981. The NAIA Women's Tournament was established one year before the NCAA Women's Basketball tournament. It was created to crown a women's national title for smaller colleges and universities. From 1992 to 2020, the NAIA sponsored a women's division II championship tournament. Also the entire tournament is played in one city (Sioux City, Iowa in one division and previously D-II, and formerly Billings, Montana in D-I). Contracts for host cities for both divisions initially expired in 2017. Following renewals, the 2018 and 2019 tournaments were held in the same cities, but in 2020, the tournaments were called off due to the COVID-19 outbreak. ==Single division (1981–1991)== For the first eleven years that the NAIA sponsored women's basketball, it held a single national championship for all programs across its entire membership. The tournament field was initially set at eight before later expansions to 16 and 32 teams. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !|Year||Arena||Location||Champion||Score||Runner-Up||Third Place||Score||Fourth Place |- | 1981 Details | rowspan=\"3\" | Kansas City, Missouri || rowspan=\"9\" | Unknown venue | Kentucky State || 73–67 || Texas Southern | Northern State || 74–65 || Azusa Pacific |- | 1982 Details | SW Oklahoma State || 80–45 || Missouri Southern State | Saginaw Valley State || 71–61 || Berry |- | 1983 Details | SW Oklahoma State (2) || 80–68 || Alabama–Huntsville | UMKC || 85–65 || Portland |- | 1984 Details | rowspan=\"2\" | Cedar Rapids, Iowa | UNC Asheville || 72–70 (OT) || Portland | Dillard || 70–66 || Berry |- | 1985 Details | SW Oklahoma State (3) || 55–54 || Saginaw Valley State | Wayland Baptist || 70–64 || Midland Lutheran |- | 1986 Details | rowspan=\"4\" | Kansas City, Missouri | Francis Marion || 75–65 || Wayland Baptist | Louisiana College || 85–78 || Georgia Southwestern |- | 1987 Details | SW Oklahoma State (4) || 60–58 || North Georgia | Wisconsin–Green Bay || 82–56 || Arkansas Tech |- | 1988 Details | Oklahoma City || 113–95 || Claflin | Arkansas Tech || 86–81 (OT) || Wingate |- | 1989 Details | Southern Nazarene || 98–96 || Claflin |colspan=3| Arkansas Tech & St. Ambrose |- | 1990 Details | rowspan=\"2\" | Jackson, Tennessee || rowspan=\"2\" | Oman Arena | SW Oklahoma State (5) || 82–75 || Arkansas–Monticello |colspan=3| Claflin & St. Ambrose |- | 1991 Details | Fort Hays State || 57–53 || SW Oklahoma State |colspan=3| Claflin & IUPUI |} ==Two divisions (1992–2020)== ===Division I=== The NAIA Women's Basketball National Championship Tournament was held at the Rimrock Auto Arena at MetraPark in Billings, Montana and has been played there since in 2012.NAIA Women's DI History The NAIA was the only international intercollegiate athletic association in North America; the NAIA Division I Women's Basketball Championship was the first championship to feature a college from outside the United States in the championship game.
