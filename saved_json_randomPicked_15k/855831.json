Later he completed a master's degree in English from the same university after spending some time at the noted Iowa Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa. During the 1970s he also worked at various factory and other jobs just long enough to get money to support his poetry writing and time spent in wilderness areas across the United States. Antler's first major work, the long poem Factory, was published by Lawrence Ferlinghetti's City Lights Bookstore in 1980. Allen Ginsberg declared him as \"one of Whitman's `poets and orators to come'\".Published in \"Van Gogh's Ear\", French Connection Press, 2004. The collection Last Words appeared in 1986 from Ballantine Books, and Antler: The Selected Poems was published in 2000 by Soft Skull Press. He has also published several chapbooks and has contributed to numerous local, national, and international journals and anthologies. == Writing style == Antler's work exhibits a punk sensibility, an unabashed sense of humor and a cutting satirical edge. His work reflects the influences of Walt Whitman, Allen Ginsberg, and the American traditions of transcendentalism and environmentalism.\"Re-arm America Vs. Re-Fellatio America\", poem - published in \"Van Gogh's Ear\", French Connection Press, 2004. He celebrates the wilderness, often comparing urban, industrial life unfavorably with natural phenomena. His frank, sometimes earthy poems frequently exhibit sexual and spiritual energy entwined with the wonder of the natural world.\"Stands To Reason\", poem - published in \"Van Gogh's Ear\", French Connection Press, 2004. == Books == *Factory - (1980) City Lights *Last Words - (1986) Ballantine *Antler: The Selected Poems - (2000) Soft Skull Press *Touch Each Other - (2013) FootHills Publishing == Awards == *Whitman Award from the Whitman Society of Camden, New Jersey *Witter Bynner Prize from the Academy & Institute of Arts and Letters in New York == References == * Nelson, Howard. \"The Work of Antler.\" The Hollins Critic, June 1998.
