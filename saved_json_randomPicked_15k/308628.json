Nor is there a solution to the equation x − φ(x) = 50, making 50 a noncototient. ==In science== *The atomic number of tin *The fifth magic number in nuclear physics ==In religion== *In Kabbalah, there are 50 Gates of Wisdom (or Understanding) and 50 Gates of Impurity *The traditional number of years in a jubilee period.Leviticus 25:10 *The Christian Feast of Pentecost takes place on the 50th day of the Easter Season *The Jewish Pentecost takes place 50 days after the Passover feast (the holiday of Shavuoth). ==In sports== * In cricket one day internationals, each side may bat for 50 overs. ==In other fields== Fifty is: * There are 50 states in the United States of America.
