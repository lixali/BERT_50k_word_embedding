 "text": "Waupaca County is a county in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. As of the 2020 census, the population was 51,812. The county seat is Waupaca. The county was created in 1851 and organized in 1853. It is named after the Waupaca River, a Menominee language name meaning 'white sand bottom', 'pale water', or 'tomorrow river'. ==History== Ancient indigenous peoples constructed earthworks that expressed their religious and political concepts. An early European explorer counted 72 such earthen mounds in what is now Waupaca County, many of them in the form of effigy mounds, shaped like \"humans, turtles, catfish and others.\"Waupaca Area Chamber of Commerce There were 52 mounds constructed around what is now called Taylor Lake. Most mounds were lost to agricultural development. One mound, shaped like a catfish, is still visible in a private yard along County Hwy. QQ, just east of Taylor Lake. The site was marked by a local women's club with a commemorative plaque installed on a large stone. Under pressure from European-American development, the Menominee people ceded their title to the United States for these lands by treaty in 1852. Following that, the flow of new migrant settlers greatly increased from the East, with people moving from New England, New York, and Ohio. They developed the land primarily for agricultural use in the early decades, also quickly establishing sawmills on the rivers. In the 1870s railroads were constructed in the county: the Wisconsin Central in 1872 and the Green Bay and Minnesota Railroad (later known as Green Bay, Minnesota & St. Paul) in 1873. These improved the county's connections to markets for its lumber and other products. For a period, entrepreneurs and merchants gained high profits from the lumber industry, establishing many fine homes in the larger cities. ==Geography== According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.3%) is water. The water includes 22 lakes that form the Waupaca Chain O' Lakes. These lakes are majority spring fed and connected by the Crystal River outlet. Waupaca County is also home to Partridge Lake on the Wolf River. ===Major highways=== {| | * 20px U.S. Highway 10 * 20px U.S. Highway 45 * 20px Wisconsin Highway 22 * 20px Wisconsin Highway 49 * 20px Wisconsin Highway 54 | * 20px Wisconsin Highway 76 * 20px Wisconsin Highway 96 * 20px Wisconsin Highway 110 * 20px Wisconsin Highway 156 * 20px Wisconsin Highway 161 |} ===Railroads=== *Canadian National *Watco ===Buses=== *List of intercity bus stops in Wisconsin ===Airports=== * KCLI - Clintonville Municipal Airport * KPCZ - Waupaca Municipal Airport ===Adjacent counties=== * Shawano County - north * Outagamie County - east * Winnebago County - southeast * Waushara County - southwest * Portage County - west * Marathon County - northwest ==Demographics== As of the census of 2000, there were 51,731 people, 19,863 households, and 13,884 families residing in the county.

Only two Democrats have carried the county at the presidential level since the formation of the Republican Party – Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932 and 1936, and Barack Obama in 2008, and in 1936 Roosevelt only won by plurality because of a sizeable vote for Union Party nominee William Lemke. It was one of only three Wisconsin counties, alongside Walworth and Waushara, to vote for Barry Goldwater over Lyndon Johnson in 1964. Like almost all of rural white America, after voting for Obama Waupaca County has swung hard towards the Republican Party in subsequent presidential elections, giving Donald Trump a two-to-one majority in 2016. In other statewide races, the county is equally Republican. The only Democratic gubernatorial candidate it has backed since at least 1908 is Albert Schmedeman in 1932. Senators Herb Kohl in 2006 and William Proxmire in 1976 and 1970 did carry Waupaca County when they swept every county in the state, but no other Democratic senatorial candidate has won the county since the Seventeenth Amendment. ==Communities== thumb|right|Waupaca County Fairgrounds ===Cities=== * Clintonville * Manawa * Marion (partly in Shawano County) * New London (partly in Outagamie County) * Waupaca (county seat) * Weyauwega ===Villages=== * Big Falls * Embarrass * Fremont * Iola * Ogdensburg * Scandinavia ===Towns=== * Bear Creek * Caledonia * Dayton * Dupont * Farmington * Fremont * Harrison * Helvetia * Iola * Larrabee * Lebanon * Lind * Little Wolf * Matteson * Mukwa * Royalton * Scandinavia * St. Lawrence * Union * Waupaca * Weyauwega * Wyoming ===Census-designated places=== * Chain O' Lakes * King * Northport ===Unincorporated communities=== * Baldwins Mill * Bear Creek Corners * Buckbee * Carmel * Cobb Town * Evanswood * Gills Landing * Hunting (partial) * Lind Center * Little Hope * Nicholson * Northland * North Readfield * Norske * Ostrander * Parfreyville * Readfield * Red Banks * Royalton * Rural * Shaw Landing * Sheridan * Schmidt Corner * Symco ===Ghost towns/neighborhoods=== * Granite City * Granite Quarry * Hatton * Little Wolf * Marble * Nowell * Petersville ==See also== * National Register of Historic Places listings in Waupaca County, Wisconsin ==References== ==Further reading== * Commemorative Biographical Record of the Upper Wisconsin Counties of Waupaca, Portage, Wood, Marathon, Lincoln, Oneida, Vilas, Langlade and Shawano.
