 "text": "The weasel war dance is a colloquial term for the behavior of excited ferrets and other members of the weasel subfamily. Naturalists speculate that weasels in the wild use the dance to confuse or disorient prey. ==In domestic ferrets== In domestic ferrets the war dance usually follows play or the successful capture of a toy or a stolen object. The war dance is commonly held to mean that the ferret is thoroughly enjoying itself. The behavior consists of a frenzied series of hops sideways and backwards, often accompanied by an arched back and a frizzed-out tail. Ferrets are notoriously clumsy in their surroundings during their dance and will often collide with or fall over objects and furniture. The war dance usually includes a clucking vocalization, known among domestic ferret owners as \"dooking\". It normally indicates happiness. Although the war dance may make a ferret appear frightened or angry, they are often just excited and are generally harmless to humans. ==In the wild== The stoat (also known as the ermine or the short-tailed weasel) reputedly mesmerises prey such as rabbits by a \"dance\" (sometimes called the weasel war dance), though this behaviour could be linked to Skrjabingylus infections. == References == ==External links== * * Archived at Ghostarchive and the Wayback Machine: * Category:Ferrets Category:Mammal behavior",
