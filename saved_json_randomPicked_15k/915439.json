Clinton was the entrep√¥t for the produce of much of the region, which, sent by rail, was transferred to steamboats at Port Hudson. Old Port Hudson was incorporated as a town in 1838.Maurice Thompson (1888), The Story of Louisiana, p. 316. During the American Civil War, the area was the scene of bitter fighting as the Confederacy and Union struggled over control of the Mississippi River (see Siege of Port Hudson). Location of the tracks and the old town can be seen at the bend of the Mississippi River (view 1864 map).Map of Port Hudson and vicinity; Prepared by order of Major General N. P. Banks under the direction of Major D. C. Houston, Chief Engineer, Department of the Gulf and Captain Peter C. Hains, Corps of Engineers, 1864 The rails and crossties of the track were removed before 1920.Milledge L. Bonham, Jr. (1917), \"Man and Nature at Port Hudson,\" in The Military Historian and Economist, Volume II, Page 372. What were then called the 1st and 3rd Regiments of the Louisiana Native Guards (later re-formed as regiments of the United States Colored Troops) proved themselves in battle on the Union side; they were the first black troops to have some black officers. A minority of men in the regiments were free men of color, who had been educated before the war; most of the soldiers were African-American slaves who had escaped to Union lines to gain freedom and support the war.Terry L. Jones (2012-10-19) \"The Free Men of Color Go to War\" - NYTimes.com. Opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com, Retrieved on 2012-12-18 Port Hudson National Cemetery was established in the area, first as a place of burial of Union dead. ==Landmarks== thumb|300px|Map of Port Hudson & vicinity, 1906. A portion of the battlefield site is maintained by the state as a park and museum, called the Port Hudson State Historic Site (in adjacent East Feliciana Parish). In 1930 the Louisiana Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy erected the Confederate Soldiers monument at the site; it is an 11,000-pound obelisk, dedicated to the defenders' memory. In 2007 the monument was moved to the yard of one of Port Hudson's few surviving buildings from the time of the siege.George Morris, \"UDC monument no longer hidden,\" The Advocate, 7 December 2007.Confederate Soldiers monument photograph circa 1940s, State Library of Louisiana.
