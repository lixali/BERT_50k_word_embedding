Nine subspecies are recognized: *Momotus momota momota - eastern Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and northern Brazil *M. m. microstephanus - southeastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador, and northwestern Brazil *M. m. ignobilis - eastern Peru and western Brazil *M. m. nattereri - northeasten Bolivia *M. m. simplex - western to west central Brazil south of the Amazon *M. m. cametensis - north central Brazil *M. m. parensis - northeastern Brazil *M. m. marcgravianus - eastern Brazil *M. m. pilcomajensis - southern Bolivia, southern Brazil, and northwestern Argentina Throughout its range the Amazonian motmot inhabits the interior and edges of humid lowand forest.
