Jiang was born in Changshu, Jiangsu. Besides the name Yangsun, he was also known by his courtesy name Youjun (), as well as the pseudonyms Nansha (), Qingtong Jushi, Qiujun, and XiGu (). The 5020-volume state-sponsored encyclopedia Gǔjīn Túshū Jíchéng () was published in 1726 and had been compiled by Chen Menglei and Jiang Tingxi during the reigns of the Kangxi and Yongzheng emperors in the Qing dynasty. As an official painter and grand secretary to the imperial court, Jiang used a wide variety of artistic styles, and focused particularly on paintings of birds and flowers. He was also proficient in calligraphy. His works influenced later court painters, including Yu Sheng(), Yu Zhi(). Although better known for his Gujin Tushu Jicheng, Jiang also contributed—along with other scholars—in the compilation of the \"Daqing Yitongzhi\" ('Gazetteer of the Qing Empire').Fairbank & Teng, 211. This geographical gazetteer was provided with a preface in 1744 (more than a decade after Jiang's death), revised in 1764, and reprinted in 1849. Apart of cultural activity, as a holder of the jinshi degree Tinxi performed the important duties in the Qing government's Office of Military Finance, on par with Zhang Tingyu (headed by Yinxiang, the Yongzheng Emperor's brother).Spence, The Search for Modern China, p.80-81 == Notes == == References == *Barnhart, R.
