It is the world's largest green tree reservoir. The Felsenthal National Wildlife Refuge is a wetlands complex near Lake Jack Lee, which is located on the confluence of the Saline and Ouachita Rivers. It is made up of various streams, creeks, lakes, and sloughs. In addition to the wetland lowlands the refuge has areas of pine and upland hardwood forests. The refuge is home to migratory and resident waterfowl as well as marsh and water birds. The park is also home to a large population of red-cockaded woodpeckers and is a habitat of the bald eagle and American alligator. The refuge also contains over 200 Native American archaeological sites, primarily from the Caddo tribe that lived in the area as long as 5,000 years ago. These sites include the remains of seasonal fishing camps, ceremonial plazas, temple mounds and large villages containing as many as 200 structures. The refuge was created in 1970. The normal navigation pool elevation is 65 feet above the mean sea level. There are about 600 river miles to the Gulf of Mexico, which yields a slope of less than 2\" per mile.Fesenthal National Wildlife Refuge ==References== ==External links== * Felsenthal National Wildlife Refuge Category:National Wildlife Refuges in Arkansas Category:Protected areas of Ashley County, Arkansas Category:Protected areas of Bradley County, Arkansas Category:Protected areas of Union County, Arkansas Category:Wetlands of Arkansas Category:Landforms of Ashley County, Arkansas Category:Landforms of Bradley County, Arkansas",
