 "text": "Carry On Behind is a 1975 British comedy film, the 27th release in the series of 31 Carry On films (1958–1992). It was the first entry in the series not to be scripted by Talbot Rothwell since Carry On Cruising 13 years previously. Rothwell's health prevented him from writing. The regular actors present are Kenneth Williams, Kenneth Connor, Jack Douglas, Joan Sims and Peter Butterworth, Bernard Bresslaw and Patsy Rowlands. ‘'Carry On Behind was the final picture in the series for Bresslaw (in his 14th), Fraser (in her fourth), Rowlands (in her ninth) as well as Carol Hawkins (in her second). It saw the only appearances of Elke Sommer, Adrienne Posta, Sherrie Hewson and Ian Lavender in a Carry On film, and is the first of two entries in the series for Windsor Davies. ==Plot== Frustrated butcher Fred Ramsden (Windsor Davies) and his dim electrician friend Ernie Bragg (Jack Douglas) happily head off for a holiday trip at the Riverside Caravan Site, while their respective wives Sylvia (Liz Fraser) and Vera (Patricia Franklin) look forward to their health farm holiday. Once at the caravan site of Major Leap (Kenneth Connor), Fred starts making eyes at two young female campers, Carol (Sherrie Hewson) and Sandra (Carol Hawkins). However, as Ernie talks in his sleep and any infidelities are likely to be spoken of in the marital bed after their holiday, Fred is despondent. Professor Roland Crump (Kenneth Williams) teams with Roman expert Anna Vrooshka (Elke Sommer) in an archaeological dig at the site. Arthur Upmore (Bernard Bresslaw) and his wife Linda (Patsy Rowlands) are saddled with her mother Daphne (Joan Sims) and her vulgar mynah bird. Arthur is caught in a compromising position with attractive blonde Norma Baxter (Adrienne Posta) whose husband Joe (Ian Lavender) is lumbered with their giant Irish wolfhound. After a few drinks with the amused pub landlord (David Lodge), Fred and Ernie discover that the caravan site is riddled with excavation holes. Daphne is perturbed by the discovery that her estranged husband Henry Barnes (Peter Butterworth) lives a downtrodden life as the camp's odd-job man, despite having won the pools. Major Leap is determined to give the place a boost and arranges an evening cabaret for the caravanners, but a mix-up over the phone secures a stripper, Veronica (Jenny Cox), rather than the singer he wanted. Carol and Sandra having hooked up with archaeology students Bob (Brian Osborne) and Clive (Larry Dann), Fred and Ernie pick up Maureen (Diana Darvey) and Sally (Georgina Moon), two beautiful young women from the village. Some wet paint, some glue, heavy rain that causes the tunnels of the dig to collapse, and the arrival of their wives soon bring their planned night of passion to a halt. ==Casting== The main roles are played by Carry On regulars Kenneth Williams, Bernard Bresslaw, Peter Butterworth, Joan Sims, Kenneth Connor, Jack Douglas and Patsy Rowlands. Newcomers to the series in major roles are Windsor Davies and Elke Sommer. Sims played the role of Rowlands's mother, despite being only eight months older than her on-screen daughter. Supporting roles are played by Sherrie Hewson, Carol Hawkins, Ian Lavender, Adrienne Posta, George Layton, Larry Dann, Larry Martyn and David Lodge. These supporting players were mostly recognisable comedy actors at the time, but not long-term regular members of the Carry On team. Liz Fraser had appeared in three early films in the series; her re-appearance here was after a gap of twelve years. This was the last Carry On film for Bernard Bresslaw and Patsy Rowlands. The part of Fred Ramsden was written for series regular Sid James, and the role of Norma Baxter was written for Barbara Windsor, but James was unavailable due to appearing in the stage play, The Mating Season, in Australia, and Windsor was unavailable due to appearing in the stage play, Carry On Barbara, in New Zealand. ==Filming== Chilly spring filming meant the bare trees, muddy fields and icy breath are all quite visible, although the setting is a summer caravanning holiday. A similar dilemma met the cast and crew in Carry On Camping. The signage in Fred Ramsden's butcher's shop clearly shows that the shop is closing for the Easter holidays, which can occur as early as March. Whilst this film was in production, Bernard Bresslaw and Joan Sims also appeared in One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing, another film being made at Pinewood Studios alongside Carry On Behind. ==Cast== *Elke Sommer as Professor Anna Vooshka *Kenneth Williams as Professor Roland Crump *Bernard Bresslaw as Arthur Upmore *Kenneth Connor as Major Leap *Jack Douglas as Ernie Bragg *Joan Sims as Daphne Barnes *Windsor Davies as Fred Ramsden *Peter Butterworth as Henry Barnes *Liz Fraser as Sylvia Ramsden *Patsy Rowlands as Linda Upmore *Ian Lavender as Joe Baxter *Adrienne Posta as Norma Baxter *Patricia Franklin as Vera Bragg *Donald Hewlett as Dean *Carol Hawkins as Sandra *Sherrie Hewson as Carol *David Lodge as Landlord *Marianne Stone as Mrs Elsie Rowan *George Layton as Doctor *Brian Osborne as Bob *Larry Dann as Clive *Georgina Moon as Sally *Diana Darvey as Maureen *Jenny Cox as Veronica *Larry Martyn as Electrician *Linda Hooks as Nurse *Kenneth Waller as Barman *Billy Cornelius as Man with salad *Melita Manger as Woman with salad *Hugh Futcher as Painter *Helli Louise as Stripper *Jeremy Connor as Student with ice cream *Alexandra Dane as Lady in low-cut dress *Sam Kelly as Projectionist (uncredited) *Johnny Briggs as Plasterer (uncredited) *Lucy Griffiths as Lady with hat (uncredited) *Stanley McGeagh as Short-sighted man (uncredited) *Brenda Cowling as Wife (uncredited) *Sidney Johnson as Man in glasses (uncredited) *Drina Pavlovic as Courting girl (uncredited) *Caroline Whitaker as Student (uncredited) *Ray Edwards as Man with water (uncredited) ==Crew== *Screenplay – Dave Freeman *Music – Eric Rogers *Production Manager – Roy Goddard *Art Director – Lionel Couch *Editor – Alfred Roome *Director of Photography – Ernest Steward *Camera Operator – Neil Binney *Assistant Director – David Bracknell *Make-up – Geoffrey Rodway *Continuity – Marjorie Lavelly *Sound Recordists – Danny Daniel & Ken Barker *Hairdresser – Stella Rivers *Costume Design – Courtenay Elliott *Set Dresser – Charles Bishop *Dubbing Editor – Pat Foster *Titles – GSE Ltd *Processor – Rank Film Laboratories *Assistant Editor – Jack Gardner *Caravans – CI Caravans Limited *Producer – Peter Rogers *Director – Gerald Thomas ==Filming and locations== *Filming dates – 10 March–18 April 1975 Interiors: * Pinewood Studios, Buckinghamshire Exteriors: * Pinewood Studios: the Orchard doubled for the caravan site, as it had for the campsite in Carry On Camping. * Maidenhead, Berkshire : the town hall doubled for the university seen at the start of the film.
