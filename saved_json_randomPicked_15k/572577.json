Listed at 5' 10.5\", 167 lb., Ramos batted right-handed and threw left-handed. Born in Maturín, Venezuela, he played under the name Chucho Ramos. ==Career== Ramos became the third player to go straight into the major leagues with no minor league experience, following Ted Lyons () and Alex Carrasquel (). He also was the second Venezuelan player to appear in a major league game, behind fellow countryman Carrasquel. Ramos was heralded as an outstanding defensive player, but back problems shortened his career. He made his majors debut on May 7, 1944 in the National League with the Cincinnati Reds, and went 3-for-4 off Max Lanier of the St. Louis Cardinals. In his brief stint with Cincinnati, Ramos went 5-for-10 for a .500 batting average in four games, including a double and one run. Resuming his career, Ramos played during 12 seasons (1946–1955) for the Magallanes team of the Venezuelan Baseball League, hitting .271 with 12 home runs and 162 RBI.
