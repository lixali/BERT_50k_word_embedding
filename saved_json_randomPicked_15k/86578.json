 "text": "In Gallo-Roman religion, Bricta or Brixta was a Gaulish goddess who was a consort of Luxovius, god of the waters of Luxeuil-les-Bains (in antiquity, Luxovium). Nicholson (1999), has suggested however that if \"Bricta is a title incorporating Bríg, it may actually be a title assigned to Sirona rather than a separate goddess\". ==Inscriptions== Bricta is recorded in the following inscriptions from Luxeuil-les-Bains : :[Lus]soio / et Brictae / Divixti/us Cons/tans / v(otum) s(olvit) (ibens) m(erito) :\"To Lusso(v)ios and Bricta, Divixtius Constans freely and deservedly fulfilled his vow.\" (CIL 13, 05425) :Luxovio / et Brixtae / G(aius) Iul(ius) Fir/manus / v(otum) s(olvit) l(ibens) m(erito) :\"To Luxovios and Brixta, Gaius Julius Firmans freely and deservedly fulfilled his vow.\" (AE 1951, 00231; CIL 13, 05426) ==Etymology== This Gaulish theonym is derived from the word brixtom or brixta meaning magic. The word also appears on the inscription of Chamalières.
