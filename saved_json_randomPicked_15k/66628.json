Atlantic Records announced that it had renewed Poe's contract for three more albums.Singer, Maya. \"Poe\" New York Post. August 21, 2001.Taylor, Chuck (editor). \"Pick Ups\" Billboard Magazine. August 26, 2001. It renewed its agreement with the boutique label, Modern/FEI Records (Fishkin Entertainment, Inc.) through which Poe was signed to Atlantic. Atlantic also committed to releasing and distributing Haunted internationally and serviced the album globally. Shortly thereafter, it printed promo copies of \"Wild\", the second single from Haunted, which included a remix by Static Revenger. Copies of that single were never sent to radio. A merger of Time Warner, the parent company of Atlantic, and AOL was approved by the FCC in January 2001. AOL Time Warner was under close scrutiny to show positive results almost immediately after the merger. With a softening of the economy after the FCC approval, it began close review of all relationships with third-party production houses, such as Modern Records In November 2001, six weeks after renewing Poe's contract, Billboard Magazine announced that Atlantic was severing ties with Modern/FEI records.Tori, Collective Soul, Poe Exit Atlantic. Billboard. Retrieved on 2012-12-14. The result was that Poe was dropped from Atlantic's roster of artists. Poe's manager and Modern/FEI label head Paul Fishkin stated that \"Poe was stunned to be let go as Atlantic had just picked up its option on her next three albums and had already printed promo CDs of her next single 'Wild' and sent them to radio.\"Lee, Felicia R. \"Tori Drops Her Label\" The New York Times. June 4, 2008.Robinson, Lisa. \"Paths Diverge inside the AOl Time Warner Merger\" Vanity Fair. December 2001. Val Azzoli, then President of Atlantic, said to Billboard Magazine of dropping Poe, \"Poe must be feeling pretty bruised right about now,\" adding that Atlantic had simply made a business decision.Newman, Melinda. \"The Beat: Waves at Atlantic\" Billboard Magazine. November 24, 2001. The article points out that it was a strange decision in light of the fact that, \"according to SoundScan, Haunted had sold 250,000 copies and the album's first single, 'Hey Pretty', had only come out two months prior.\" Spinner reflected ten years later on the business decision and its impact stating, \"With a gold record under her belt, a acclaimed second album, a new hit single, strong sales, and an arena tour opening for Depeche Mode, Poe was well-established as an important influence. And then, poof—she disappeared.\" ==2001–2011== In 2002, a story in the August issue of LA Weekly shed some light on the action of Atlantic to drop their rapidly rising artist with commitments and creative work underway. Poe had been signed to Atlantic in 1995 through a boutique label called Modern Records/Fishkin Entertainment Inc. (FEI). Amid the complex merger of Time Warner with AOL in 2000, it came to light that, in spite of the fact that Atlantic was responsible for providing all funding, marketing, publicity, radio promotion, tour support and distribution for the Poe project, Modern/FEI (not Atlantic) in its 1982 distribution deal with Atlantic, was awarded ownership of the masters of all Poe recordings. What this meant for Atlantic was that, by renewing Poe's contract, Atlantic had committed sizable resources to a project in which it would have a financial participation, but not an equity stake in Poe's past, present or future catalogue.Babayan, Siran. \"Free Poe. Free Fiona.\" LA Weekly. August 11–16, 2002. In November 2000, Atlantic/AOL Time Warner first chose to drop Modern/FEI, and as a result were contractually obligated to pay Modern/FEI an undisclosed amount of money, and effectively release themselves from any further fiduciary responsibilities to Modern/ FEI and/or Poe. This resulted in a pay-off for Modern/FEI and prematurely ended all printing, distribution, marketing, and promotion of Poe's second album Haunted. In exchange for these monies, Modern/FEI's agreed to give Atlantic a two-year grace period during which Modern/FEI agreed not to do anything commercially with any of Poe's master recordings, enabling Atlantic to sell off their stock of already produced copies of Haunted. As a result, Haunted received no further promotional support and the album faded from the market place.Klein, Alec. \"New Firm to Follow Three Leaders\" Washington Post. December 15, 2000.\"AOL Reorganizes: Who Reports to Whom Inside Company\" Dow Jones News Service. May 2002 In 2004, Modern/ FEI sold the Poe Masters for Hello and Haunted to Sheridan Square Music who merged in 2005 with V2 Records, which cataloged the Poe masters under a sub-label called IndieBlu. IndieBlu and Sheridan Square Music were acquired by Entertainment One in 2009. In 2001, as Haunted was climbing the charts, Poe turned to a friend of her fiancé's father, Robert M. Edsel for legal advice. He advised her to retain the services of his firm's legal counsel, David Helfant on a professional basis. Edsel and Helfant told Poe that she could expect a settlement from FEI or Atlantic within a few months, and advised her to sever her relationship with her management firm and her accounting firm in order to avoid sharing a portion of her settlement. Poe understood that Edsel took over her business management, who over a year lent Poe $200,000 for living costs, professional expenses and repayment of debts, with a signed promissory note which indicated that if there was a default her current and future works would be eligible to be used for repayment. A settlement with Atlantic was never obtained, Poe's new management through Edsel and colleagues did not secure paying work, and the loan was defaulted upon. Consequently, Poe sued on the grounds that she had been represented by an unlicensed agency and therefore the agreement was void. Edsel kept Poe tied up in court, unable to release new music or perform professionally for a few years. What music Poe did release during that time was generally done under the pseudonym \"Jane.\" Ultimately, the case was found in Poe's favour, voiding the contract but obliging her to repay the portion of the loan that was not used to pay for Edsel and colleagues’ services. Poe was able to perform for charitable events during this period, and she collaborated on film soundtracks and continued to compose and write.Ragogna, Mike. \"From Atlantis To Los Angeles - El Rey: A Conversation with Donovan.\" HuffingtonPost.com March 19, 2010.News.
