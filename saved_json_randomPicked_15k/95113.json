 "text": "Branch County is a county in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 Census, the population was 44,862. The county seat is Coldwater. As one of the \"cabinet counties\" it was named for the U.S. Secretary of the Navy John Branch under President Andrew Jackson. The county was founded in 1829, and was organized in 1833. Branch County comprises the Coldwater, MI Micropolitan Statistical Area. ==History== Branch County was a New England settlement. The original founders of Coldwater were settlers from the northern coastal colonies – \"Yankees\", descended from the English Puritans who came from the Old World in the 1600s and who brought their culture. During the early 1800s, there was a wave of New England farmers who headed west into what was then the untamed Northwest Territory. Many traveled through New York State via the Erie Canal; the threat of Native Americans had been reduced by the end of the Black Hawk War. These early settlers laid out farms, constructed roads, erected government buildings, and established post routes. They brought a passion for education, and established many schools. Many were supporters of abolitionism. They were mostly members of the Congregationalist Church though some were Episcopalian. Culturally Branch County, like much of Michigan, developed as part of the Northern Tier, continuous with New England culture, during its early history. The county still depends on agriculture as the basis of its economy. ==Geography== According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.6%) is water.
