 "text": "The Calanshio Sand Sea (Sarīr Kalanshiyū ar Ramlī al Kabīr, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) ) is a sand desert region located in the Libyan Desert, of the Kufra District in Cyrenaica, eastern Libya. It has a surface of approximately 62,000 km².Desert Geomorphology, p. 403BoksburgHistorical.com: African Relics (Calanshio Sand Sea and \"Lady Be Good\") The erg extends from Jaghbub and Jalo in the north to Kufra in the south, a distance of 500km. The erg lies parallel to the Egyptian Sand Sea and is contiguous with it at their northern ends. They contain dunes up to 110m in height: these lie in a roughly north-south direction and were created by the wind. The Calanshio Sand Sea is the site of the missing World War II B-24 Liberator Lady Be Good. The wreck was discovered north of Kufra 15 years after it was reported missing in 1943. The crew bailed out believing they were over the sea, when their plane ran out of fuel, and they became lost. When they landed in the Libyan Desert they could feel a northwesterly breeze. Thinking they were near the Mediterranean, they headed into the wind hoping it would lead them to safety. However, they were more than inland from the Mediterranean, and slowly died from dehydration after covering with minimal water in a place so dry even the desert Bedouins refuse to enter. ==See also== *Libyan Desert **Ribiana Sand Sea **Idehan Murzuq **Idehan Ubari ==References== ==External links== *\"Body and wallets lie among 200-foot dunes\" (\"Lady Be Good in the Calanshio Sand Sea) Category:Dunes of Libya Category:Deserts of Libya Category:Sahara Category:Kufra District Category:Cyrenaica Category:Landforms of Libya Category:Ergs of Africa",
