From a young age, Kore-eda would spend time watching movies with his mother. He said through an interpreter, \"My mother loved films! She adored Ingrid Bergman, Joan Fontaine, Vivien Leigh. We couldn’t afford to go together to the cinema, but she was always watching their movies on TV. She stopped all family business or discussions to watch these movies. We would watch together. So I adored film – like her.\" After graduating from Waseda University's Graduate School of Letters, Arts and Sciences in 1987, Kore-eda worked on documentaries, where he was subject to aggressive management. He has cited this as being the reason he tries to avoid becoming angry on his sets and to encourage a happy work environment.

In 2020, it was announced that he will direct Broker. The film will be set in South Korea, featuring a predominantly South Korean cast and crew. ==Style and influences== According to the Harvard Film Archive, Kore-eda's works \"reflect the contemplative style and pacing of such luminaries as Hou Hsiao-hsien and Tsai Ming-liang\". Kore-eda is most often compared to Yasujirō Ozu, although the directors he has said he feels influenced by are Ken Loach and Japanese director Mikio Naruse. In a 2009 interview, Kore-eda revealed that Still Walking is based on his own family.Interview with Hirokazu Kore- eda, MUBI.com; accessed 27 February 2018. ==Filmography== ===Film=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! rowspan=\"2\"| Film ! colspan=\"4\"| Credited as ! rowspan=\"2\"| Notes |- ! style=\"width:65px;\"| Director ! style=\"width:65px;\"| Screenwriter ! style=\"width:65px;\"| Editor ! style=\"width:65px;\"| Producer |- | 1991 | Lessons from a Calf | | | | | Documentary |- | 1991 | However... | | | | | Documentary |- | 1994 | August without Him | | | | | Documentary |- | 1995 | Maborosi | | | | | |- | 1998 | After Life | | | | | |- | 2001 | Distance | | | | | |- | 2004 | Nobody Knows | | | | | |- | 2006 | Hana | | | | | |- | 2008 | Still Walking | | | | | |- | 2008 | Daijōbu Dearu Yō ni: Cocco Owaranai Tabi | | | | | Documentary |- | 2009 | Air Doll | | | | | |- | 2011 | I Wish | | | | | |- | 2012 | The Message from Fukushima (short) | | | | | Documentary |- | 2013 | Like Father, Like Son | | | | | |- | 2015 | Our Little Sister | | | | | |- | 2016 | After the Storm | | | | | |- | 2017 | The Third Murder | | | | | |- | 2018 | Shoplifters | | | | | |- | 2019 | The Truth | | | | |French film |- | 2022 | Broker | | | | |South Korean film |} ===Television=== *Nonfix (1991) *Without Memory (1996) *Kaidan Horror Classics (2010) *Going My Home (2012) *Ishibumi (2015) *Kasumi Arimura's Filming Break (2020; episode 1, 3) *The Makanai: Cooking for the Maiko House (2022) ==Accolades== *1995: Vancouver International Film Festival – Dragons and Tigers Award (Maborosi) *1998: San Sebastian Film Festival – FIPRESCI Prize (After Life) *1998: Three Continents Festival – Golden Montgolfiere (After Life) *1999: Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema – Best Film and Best Screenplay (After Life) *2004: Flanders International Film Festival Ghent – Grand Prix (Nobody Knows) *2005: Blue Ribbon Awards – Best Film and Best Director (Nobody Knows) *2008: Mar del Plata International Film Festival – Best Film (Still Walking) *2009: Asian Film Awards – Best Director (Still Walking) *2009: Blue Ribbon Awards – Best Director (Still Walking) *2011: San Sebastian Film Festival – Best Screenplay (I Wish) *2012: Asia-Pacific Film Festival – Best Director (I Wish) *2013: Cannes Film Festival – Jury Prize (Like Father, Like Son) *2013: Asia-Pacific Film Festival – Best Film and Best Director (Like Father, Like Son) *2013: São Paulo International Film Festival – Audience Award Best Foreign Film (Like Father, Like Son) *2013: Vancouver International Film Festival – Audience Award International Films (Like Father, Like Son) *2013: Yokohama Film Festival – Best Screenplay (Like Father, Like Son) *2015: San Sebastian Film Festival – Audience Award Best Film (Our Little Sister) *2015: Yokohama Film Festival – Best Director (Our Little Sister) *2016: Japan Academy Prize – Best Film and Best Director (Our Little Sister) *2016: Films from the South – Best Film (After the Storm) *2018: Japan Academy Prize – Best Film, Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best Editing (The Third Murder) *2018: Cannes Film Festival – Palme d'Or (Shoplifters) *2018: Los Angeles Film Critics Association – Best Foreign Film (Shoplifters) *2018: San Sebastián International Film Festival – Donostia Award *2018: Asia Pacific Screen Awards – Best Film (Shoplifters) *2018: Denver Film Festival – Best Film (Shoplifters) *2018: Filmfest München – Best International Film (Shoplifters) *2018: Films from the South – Audience Award (Shoplifters) *2018: Vancouver International Film Festival – Most Popular International Feature (Shoplifters) *2019: Asian Film Awards – Best Film (Shoplifters) *2019: Japan Academy Prize – Best Film, Best Director, and Best Screenplay (Shoplifters) *2019: César Award – Best Foreign Film (Shoplifters) *2019: Guldbagge Awards – Best Foreign Film (Shoplifters) ==Frequent collaborators== Kore-eda often casts the same actors in his narrative films, in particular Kirin Kiki and Susumu Terajima, both of whom have appeared in six of Kore-eda's films.
