The show constantly preaches about friendship and helping others. ... Nearly every episode features Ash, Misty, and Brock on a trip. Team Rocket tries the latest scheme to catch Pikachu or whatever else, and fails miserably.\" He concluded: \"at the end of the day, this franchise feels more like crass marketing trying to preach the importance of friend and companionship.\" In an April 2008 review, Common Sense Media gave the series 3 out of 5 stars, saying: \"Over the years, the energetic, imagination-filled, Japanese-inspired fantasy series has cut across cultural, gender, and age barriers to captivate a global audience of girls, boys, and even adults\", but added: \"Folks may also find the franchise's massive commercial appeal disturbing, especially since the show is mainly geared towards kids.\" Carl Kimlinger, in an August 2008 review of the Diamond and Pearl series for Anime News Network, gave the dubbed series an overall grade of C. He wrote: \"The formula has been set in stone … Ash and buddies wander around, meet a new or trainer, fight, make friends, and then use their newfound Power of Friendship to stave off an attack by the nefarious Team Rocket\", and added: \"even the tournaments are a relief, a blessed pause in the cerebrum-liquefying formula as Ash and company square off against destined rivals for an episode or two.\" However, he stated that it would be enjoyed by its target audience, saying: \"It's colorful, silly and lively (if insanely simplistic and cheap)\" and added: \"Parents will appreciate the absolute lack of objectionable content (aside from the promotion of animism) and the series' impeccably PC message of friendship, cooperation and acceptance\". He criticized the series' soundtrack as \"tin-eared\" and \"bad video game music\". Kevin McFarland, in a 2016 binge- watching guide of the Indigo League series for Wired, described the series as \"a kids program that emphasizes the value of hard work, the importance of family and close friendship, and the ideals of love, trust, and honor. But it's also a largely silly show with slapstick comedy and colorful battle sequences, making Ash's Sisyphean task to become the world’s best Pokémon trainer continually entertaining.\" Paste ranked the series at 44th place in its October 2018 list of \"The 50 Best Anime Series of All Time\", with Sarra Sedghi writing: \"To the joy of ’90s kids everywhere, Pokémon helped solidify anime (and, hopefully, good punnery) in the West\". She added: \"Pokémon may not be high artistry (because, you know, it’s for children), but the show’s pervasiveness is a testament to the power of nostalgia.\" IGN ranked the series at 70th place in its list of \"Top 100 Animated Series\", saying that the series \"had clever writing and a golden marketing formula designed to spread Nintendo's Pokémon videogames into new, lucrative territory.\" === Controversies === Pokémon has had several anime episodes removed from the rotation in Japan or the rest of the world. The most infamous of these episodes was . The episode made headlines worldwide when it caused 685 children to experience seizures and seizure-like symptoms caused by a repetitive flash of light. Although the offending sequence was caused by Pikachu's actions, the episode's featured Pokémon, Porygon, has rarely been seen in future episodes, with appearances limited to one brief cameo appearance in the movie Pokémon Heroes and in one scene-bumper later in season 1. Its evolutions Porygon2 and Porygon-Z have only appeared in a brief part of the opening sequence of Pokémon the Movie: Kyurem vs. the Sword of Justice. Several other episodes have been removed from broadcast in Japan due to contemporary disasters that resemble events in the program; the 2004 Chūetsu earthquake, the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, and the 2014 Sinking of MV Sewol all have caused cancellations or indefinite or temporary postponements of episode broadcasts. In the United States, the September 11 attacks in 2001 as well as 2005's Hurricane Katrina led to the temporary removal of two episodes from syndication. On September 1, 2006, China banned the series from prime time broadcasting (from 17:00 to 20:00), as it did Western animated series such as The Simpsons, to protect its struggling animation studios. The ban was later extended by one hour. On August 18, 2016, the XYZ episode (Down to the Fiery Finish! in the English dub) faced criticism from fans when Ash lost the Kalos League against Alain. The fans specifically criticized the episode due to the misleading name and trailers that suggested that Ash would win the battle and because Ash had lost all of the Pokémon Leagues in past seasons. Fans also disliked the outcome because they believed Ash's Greninja had many advantages over Alain's Charizard, including the fact that Water-type Pokémon resist Fire-type Pokémon attacks, and that the rare Bond Phenomenon Ash's Greninja was subject to was said to be far more powerful than a conventional Mega Evolution. Several animators of the series also expressed disappointment that Ash had lost. TV Tokyo's YouTube upload of the teaser of the next episode received an overwhelming number of dislikes as a result of the outcome. === Influence === The series is considered to be one of the first anime series on television to reach this level of mainstream success with Western audiences. It has also been credited with allowing the game series to reach a high degree of popularity, and vice versa. == See also == * List of television programs based on video games == Notes == == References == == Further reading == * \\- Displays the dubbing process done by Sarah Natochenny == External links == * Official website * Pokémon seasons * Pokémon anime website at TV Tokyo * Pokémon TV Anime at Pokémon JP official website * Category:Pokémon anime Category:1997 Japanese television series debuts Category:Adventure anime and manga Category:Animated television series about children Category:Animated television series about teenagers Category:Anime television series based on video games Category:Comedy anime and manga Category:Cryptozoological television series Category:Fantasy anime and manga Category:Japanese children's animated adventure television series Category:Japanese children's animated comedy television series Category:Japanese children's animated fantasy television series Category:Netflix original anime Category:TV Tokyo original programming Category:Television articles with disputed naming style Category:Viz Media anime Category:Works based on Nintendo video games",
