 "text": "Yoncalla (also Southern Kalapuya or Yonkalla) is an extinct Kalapuyan language once spoken in southwest Oregon in the United States. In the 19th century it was spoken by the Yoncalla band of the Kalapuya people in the Umpqua River valley. It is closely related to Central Kalapuya and Northern Kalapuya, spoken in the Willamette Valley to the north. The last known user of the language was Laura Blackery Albertson, who attested to being a partial speaker in 1937. == References == == External links == *OLAC resources in and about the Southern Kalapuya language Category:Kalapuyan languages Category:Indigenous languages of Oregon Category:Indigenous languages of the Pacific Northwest Coast Category:Languages of the United States Category:Extinct languages of North America Category:Languages extinct in the 1930s Category:1930s disestablishments in Oregon Category:Native American history of Oregon",
