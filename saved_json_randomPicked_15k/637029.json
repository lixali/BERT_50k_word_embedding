Other achievements of note include reaching the semi-finals of the 2000 Malta Grand Prix and the Scottish Open. Following a dramatic rise, in the 2000–01 season Fu was ranked 15th in the world, his first appearance in the top 16. However, a succession of defeats and a first round loss at the 2001 World Snooker Championship to Chris Small, saw him fall out of the top 16 for next season. In the 2001–02 season Fu's best result was a last 16 appearance at the LG Cup. He failed to qualify for three ranking events, including the 2002 World Snooker Championship, and, as a result, his ranking fell to 27 for the following season.
