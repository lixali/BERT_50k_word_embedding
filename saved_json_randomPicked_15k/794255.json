 "text": "Jan Theuninck (born 7 June 1954) is a Belgian painter and poet. Although born in Zonnebeke, Belgium, and a native speaker of Dutch, he writes in French and occasionally English. His painting is abstract, falling somewhere between minimalism and monochrome expressionism. As a painter, he has been influenced by Ellsworth Kelly and Joan Mir√≥. His work in both media is guided by his social and political convictions, dealing with topics such as colonialism old and new, mass and society, and pacifism. ==External links== * * Holocaust by Jan Theuninck on Boekgrrls *Exhibition G20 Summit Conference in Seoul, Korea *Peace Museum, Holland *Charter for Compassion Category:Belgian painters Category:Belgian poets in French Category:Flemish writers Category:1954 births Category:Living people",
