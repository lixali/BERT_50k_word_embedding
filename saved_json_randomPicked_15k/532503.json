The complex, the former Newport Casino, includes a museum, grass tennis courts, and an indoor tennis facility. The International Tennis Hall of Fame is a non-profit organization with the goal to preserve, celebrate, and inspire the sport of tennis around the world. ==History== thumb|left|267px|Inner courtyard The hall of fame and museum are located in the Newport Casino, which was commissioned in 1879 by James Gordon Bennett Jr. as part of an exclusive resort for wealthy Newport summer residents. It was designed by Charles McKim along with Stanford White, who did the interiors. It is an example of Victorian Shingle Style architecture.Cheryl Hackett, Newport Shingle Style (Frances Lincoln, ltd., 2010) pg. 11 In 1881, the Real Tennis Court (housing the National Tennis Club) and the Casino Theatre were constructed at the east end of the campus. The club was opened on July 1, 1880, after a six-month construction period and quickly became a fashionable venue for Newport summer residents. The United States Lawn Tennis Association held its first championships at the Newport Casino in 1881. The event was held annually through 1914, by which time tennis had become the key attraction at the resort. The championship was suspended during World War I. But by the 1950s, the retreat was struggling financially, as tourism preferences changed. It was at risk of being demolished for redevelopment of modern retail space, but the building was purchased and saved by Jimmy and Candy Van Alen, wealthy Newport summer residents. A sportsman himself, in 1954, Jimmy Van Alen established the Tennis Hall of Fame and Museum in the Casino. The combination of tennis matches and the museum allowed the building to be saved. thumb|right|270px|The entrance to the International Tennis Hall of Fame (2021) Van Alen intended the facility to be \"a shrine to the ideals of the game\", and was elected president of the hall in 1957. The International Tennis Hall of Fame was officially sanctioned by the United States Tennis Association at its foundation in 1954. It was recognized by the International Tennis Federation in 1986. The first Hall of Fame members were inducted in 1955; as of 2017, a total of 252 inductees from 23 countries have been recognized. In 2015, Martina Hingis was appointed as the first Global Ambassador for the International Tennis Hall of Fame.Martina Hingis named Global Ambassador for the International Tennis Hall of Fame. Retrieved on September 11, 2015. The current Board of Governors includes former professional tennis players Todd Martin, Stan Smith and Katrina Adams. == TeamFAME == TeamFame is the International Tennis Hall of Fame's NJTL Chapter.

Cullman 3rd Award *Samuel Hardy Award *Tennis Educational Merit Award ==Infosys Hall of Fame Open== The Hall of Fame hosts several tournaments, including the Infosys Hall of Fame Open in July. The Infosys Hall of Fame Open is a part of the US Open Series, as well as being part of the men's ATP World Tour, the tournament is the only grass court event in North America. Top male players come to Newport directly from Wimbledon to compete for the Van Alen Cup at the International Tennis Hall of Fame. Past champions include Americans John Isner; 4x Hall of Fame Open Champion, and Mardy Fish, as well as two-time champion Fabrice Santoro of France. During the tournament, Tennis Hall of Famers are officially inducted in front of family, friends, fans, and members of the Tennis Hall of Fame. ==Members== Being inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame is the ultimate honor in tennis. It represents the sum of one's achievements and contributions as being among the most important and transformative in tennis history. There is a seven-step process to be inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame. A player or contributor must be nominated to be inducted, and then the national enshrinement committee reviews their eligibility. Once it is decided if they are eligible, the committee reviews if the nominee will be considered by voters. After review, the voting begins; both group and fan voting takes place. A nominee must receive at least 75% from the Official Voting Group result or a combined total of 75% or more from the Official Voting Group result and any bonus percentage points they earn through the Fan Vote. Votes are tallied by an independent accounting firm. The class induction is announced in January, and the new class is inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame in July at the International Tennis Hall of Fame. *For further details, see
