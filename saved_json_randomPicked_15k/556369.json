 "text": "Superjoint, formerly known as Superjoint Ritual, was an American heavy metal band. ==History== The band was formed by Phil Anselmo, Joe Fazzio, and Jimmy Bower in the early 1990s, later to be joined by Hank Williams III and Kevin Bond. They were founded by Anselmo parallel to his membership in Pantera, but became a full-time endeavor a few years later after Pantera's dissolution. Despite their early 1990s establishment, it was not until a decade later, after the folding of Pantera, that the group recorded any albums. It was then that Superjoint Ritual garnered significant TV exposure on programs such as MTV2's Headbangers Ball and Fuse TV's Uranium. However, the group's time in the spotlight would prove short lived. A dispute between Anselmo and Fazzio led to the band's eventual split in late 2004, which was confirmed by both Hank Williams III and Jimmy Bower. The band reunited at the Housecore Horror Film Festival in Austin, Texas in October 2014. For legal reasons, the band performed under the name \"Superjoint\". Hank Williams III was initially supposed to take part in this first reunion show, but had to bow out due to personal issues. Although their appearance at Housecore Horror was supposed to be the only reunion show, the band would later perform at Hellfest 2015. Superjoint released their latest album to date, Caught Up in the Gears of Application, on November 11, 2016, through Housecore Records. In January 2017, Superjoint played a tour with Battlecross and Child Bite. In an interview in June 2019, Anselmo mentioned that he was no longer interested in playing with Superjoint. In October 2020, bassist Stephen Taylor said he is unsure if the band is still active. Further interviews with guitarist Jimmy Bower in 2021 confirmed that the band is finished, with no plans to do any further work. Bower cited his and Anselmo's disinterest in working on material related to the band, as well as their existing commitments to Eyehategod and Philip H. Anselmo & The Illegals. ==Musical style and influences== Superjoint's style has been described as a mix of sludge metal and hardcore punk. Bands like Venom, Slayer, Celtic Frost, Voivod, and Darkthrone have also been noted as influences. The name \"Superjoint Ritual\" comes from a lyric in the Darkthrone song \"The Pagan Winter\". According to Bower, Anselmo wrote 70–80% of the group's music. == Members == ;Final lineup * Phil Anselmo – vocals (1993–2004, 2014–2019), additional guitars (1993–1998, 2002–2004, 2014–2019), lead guitar (1998–2002) * Jimmy Bower – rhythm guitar (1993–2004, 2014–2019) * Kevin Bond – lead guitar (2002–2004, 2014–2019), bass (1994–1995) * Stephen Taylor – bass (2014–2019) * Jose Gonzalez – drums (2014–2019) ;Former * Michael Haaga – bass (1993–1994, 1995–2002) * Hank Williams III – bass (2002–2004) * Joe Fazzio – drums (1993–2004) * Marzi Montazeri – lead guitar (1996–1998) ; Timeline ImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:20 PlotArea = left:100 bottom:150 top:10 right:20 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1993 till:02/01/2018 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Legend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom ScaleMajor = increment:2 start:1993 ScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1993 Colors = id:vocals value:red legend:Vocals id:lguitar value:teal legend:Lead_guitar id:rguitar value:brightgreen legend:Rhythm_guitar id:bass value:blue legend:Bass id:drums value:orange legend:Drums id:studio value:black legend:Studio_album LineData = layer:back color:studio at:05/21/2002 at:07/23/2003 at:11/11/2016 BarData = bar:Anselmo text:\"Phil Anselmo\" bar:Marzi text:\"Marzi Montazeri\" bar:Bower text:\"Jimmy Bower\" bar:Haaga text:\"Michael Haaga\" bar:Bond text:\"Kevin Bond\" bar:Hank text:\"Hank Williams III\" bar:Taylor text:\"Steven Taylor\" bar:Fazzio text:\"Joe Fazzio\" bar:Gonzalez text:\"Joey Gonzalez\" PlotData= width:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(11,-4) bar:Anselmo from:01/01/1993 till:01/01/2004 color:vocals bar:Anselmo from:01/01/1994 till:01/01/2002 color:lguitar width:3 bar:Anselmo from:01/01/2014 till:end color:vocals bar:Marzi from:01/01/1993 till:01/01/1994 color:lguitar bar:Bower from:01/01/1993 till:01/01/2004 color:rguitar bar:Bower from:01/01/2014 till:end color:rguitar bar:Haaga from:01/01/1993 till:01/01/1995 color:bass bar:Bond from:01/01/1995 till:01/01/1996 color:bass bar:Haaga from:01/01/1996 till:01/01/2002 color:bass bar:Bond from:01/01/2002 till:01/01/2004 color:lguitar bar:Bond from:01/01/2014 till:end color:lguitar bar:Hank from:01/01/2002 till:01/01/2004 color:bass bar:Fazzio from:01/01/1993 till:01/01/2004 color:drums bar:Taylor from:01/01/2014 till:end color:bass bar:Gonzalez from:01/01/2014 till:end color:drums == Discography == === Studio albums === *Use Once and Destroy (2002, Sanctuary Records) *A Lethal Dose of American Hatred (2003, Sanctuary Records) *Caught Up in the Gears of Application (2016, Housecore Records) === Demos === *1995 Demo *1997 Demo == Videography == === DVDs === *Live in Dallas, TX 2002 (2002, Sanctuary Visual Entertainment) *Live at CBGB's (2004, Sanctuary Visual Entertainment) == References == == External links == * AllMusic page * NOLA Underground (New Orleans underground music scene) * Superjoint page on Philip Anselmo's official site Category:Heavy metal musical groups from Louisiana Category:American sludge metal musical groups Category:Crossover thrash groups Category:American heavy metal musical groups Category:American thrash metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1993 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2004 Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2014 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2019",
