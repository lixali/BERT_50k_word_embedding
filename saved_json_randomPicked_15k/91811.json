 "text": "Hutchinson County is a county in the U.S. state of South Dakota. As of the 2020 United States Census, the population was 7,427. Its county seat is Olivet. The county was created in 1862 and organized in 1871; it was named for John Hutchinson, first territorial secretary. ==History== Hutchinson County was created by act of the territorial legislature on May 8, 1862. Its boundaries included portions of present-day Davison and Hanson Counties, and part of what is presently Hutchinson County was within the boundaries of Jayne County. Maxwell City was established as the county seat, and it remained there until October 1873 when it was moved to Olivet following an election. On 13 January 1871, the territorial legislature established the present county boundaries and completed its governing organization. In two actions in January 1873, the legislature divided Hutchinson County into two counties - the northern half was named Armstrong County, with Milltown as the seat. However, in 1879, Armstrong County was dissolved and its area re-annexed into Hutchinson County.The Territorial Legislature ordered the re-uniting of the two counties into one, apparently against the desires of Armstrong County officials. The legislature ordered the county officers of Armstrong County to deliver their records, money and papers to Olivet. However, the Armstrong people refused and continued to serve as county officers until a court decision in 1881 compelled them to surrender the records.History, First Circuit Court, SD Unified Justice System (accessed February 4, 2019) ==Geography== The James River flows south-southeasterly through the central part of Hutchinson County.

German-speaking Mennonites from Russia settled in the county beginning in 1874 until the early 1880s. South Dakota has the nation's largest population of Hutterites, a communal Anabaptist group that emigrated also from Russia during the same period as the Mennonites, with whom they share the Anabaptist faith. Hutterites live in communities each of about 150 people. Wolf Creek Colony is in Hutchinson County, where the Wolf meets the James River. This colony is west of Freeman and north of Olivet and Menno. Other Hutterite communities in the county are Maxwell Colony, New Elm Spring Colony, Old Elm Spring Colony, and Tschetter Colony. ==Communities== ===Cities=== * Freeman * Parkston ===Towns=== * Tripp * Menno * Olivet (county seat) * Dimock ===Census-designated places=== * Kaylor * Milltown ===Unincorporated communities=== * Clayton * Lake Tripp * Wolf Creek ===Townships=== *Capital *Clayton *Cross Plains *Fair *Foster *German *Grandview *Kassel *Kaylor *Kulm *Liberty *Mittown *Molan *Oak Hollow *Pleasant *Sharon *Silver Lake *Starr *Susquehanna *Sweet *Valley *Wittenberg *Wolf Creek ==Politics== Like most of South Dakota, Hutchinson County is overwhelmingly Republican. Only one Democratic presidential candidate – Franklin D. Roosevelt in his 1932 landslide – has ever carried the county. Surprisingly, in the 1928 and 1972 Republican landslides Hutchinson County actually voted more Democratic than the nation at-large due to German Lutheran anti-Prohibition voting for Al Smith in the first case and a strong “favorite son” vote for George McGovern in the latter. Apart from these two hugely anomalous cases, only four Democrats have ever topped forty percent of the county's vote, and only four statewide Republican nominees failed to win a majority. ==See also== * National Register of Historic Places listings in Hutchinson County, South Dakota ==References== Category:1871 establishments in Dakota Territory Category:States and territories established in 1871",
