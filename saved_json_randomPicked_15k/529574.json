 "text": "Triumph the Insult Comic Dog is a puppet character created by Conan O'Brien and puppeteered and voiced by Robert Smigel, best known for mocking celebrities in an Eastern European accent. As his name indicates, Triumph's comedic style is almost exclusively insult comedy. A Yugoslavian Mountain Hound, Triumph often puffs a cigar, which usually falls out of his mouth when he starts talking. He debuted in 1997 on NBC's Late Night with Conan O'Brien as a fictional Yugoslavian mountain dog and also appeared on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien from time to time, as well as the short-lived TV Funhouse, TBS's Conan, and Adult Swim's The Jack and Triumph Show. Smigel and Triumph have been ejected from several events for Triumph's antics, including the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, the Honolulu line for auditions for American Idol, and the 2004 Democratic National Convention (while shooting an aborted movie project). The character is also notable for being performed by Eminem at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards and music video for his song \"Ass Like That\". ==Notable appearances== ===Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show=== Beginning in 1998, Triumph regularly crashed the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in New York, interacting with the real dogs and being ejected.Michael Precker, \"Dog Sock Puppets In Hand-To-Hand Combat\", Dallas Morning News, via Sun-Sentinel, May 2, 2000.John Jurgensen, \"The Triumph of Bathroom Humor\", The Hartford Courant, November 9, 2003.Neal Justin, \"Robert Smigel talks about the return of Triumph the Insult Comic Dog\", Star Tribune, February 19, 2015.Travis Petersen, \"Album Reviews: Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, Come Poop With Me\", Student Life (Washington University, St. Louis), January 26, 2004. ===Space Ghost Coast to Coast=== In 2004, Triumph appeared as the guest star on the hit Adult Swim series Space Ghost Coast to Coast in the episode \"Dreams\". Triumph offhandedly mentions having anal sex with Lassie, which causes friction between Space Ghost and Moltar over such topics being brought up on television. ===2004 presidential campaign=== Triumph filmed a number of segments during the 2004 US presidential election cycle. In November 2003, in the early days of the 2004 U.S. presidential primary campaign, Triumph was the \"lead guest\" on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno the same night that Democratic candidate John Kerry also appeared on the show. Kerry made a dramatic entry, riding his Harley-Davidson motorcycle onto the stage; but Triumph, in characteristic style, poked fun at him with a series of scathingly rude remarks, to Kerry's evident discomfort.\"2 Kerry Officials Quit to Protest Firing of Top Aide\" By Susannah Rosenblatt and Mark Z Barabak, Los Angeles Times, November 12, 2003 (page A-26) (Among his jibes: \"The poop I made in the dressing room had more heat than John Kerry!\")ABCNEWS.com \"The Note\", November 12, 2003 In July and August 2004, Triumph followed up with visits to both major parties' national conventions.

On Conan, It'll Be Sock Puppet vs. Triumph\", The Washington Post, May 4, 2000. The bankruptcy and closing of the company during the dot-com bust of 2000 ended the lawsuit.
