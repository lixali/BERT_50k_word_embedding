 "text": "St. Martin Parish () is a parish located in the U.S. state of Louisiana, founded in 1811. Its parish seat is St. Martinville, and the largest city is Breaux Bridge. At the 2010 U.S. census, the population was 52,160. At the 2020 census, 51,767 people lived in the parish. St. Martin Parish is part of the Lafayette metropolitan area in the region of Acadiana, along the Gulf Coast. ==History== In 1811, parts of Attakapas Parish were taken out to create St. Martin and St. Mary parishes. In 1824, St. Martin Parish was divided, resulting in the creation also of Lafayette Parish. In 1844, St. Martin Parish was again divided, yielding Vermilion Parish. In 1868, Iberia Parish was formed from parts of St. Martin Parish and St. Mary Parish. St. Martin Parish was divided into two, as part of Iberia Parish runs between the two non- contiguous parts of St. Martin Parish. St. Martin Parish was largely colonized in the 1700s by people from France and Acadia, resulting in a large concentration of French-speaking population today. The Acadians brought the tale of Evangeline, a young woman said to have been separated from her mortally wounded betrothed during their expulsion by the British from their territory in eastern Canada. According to the tale, Evangeline later met her betrothed again in St. Martin Parish, but he had already committed to a new love. Evangeline never recovered from the shock of both finding and losing him again. Poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's work, Evangeline, A Tale of Acadie, was based on this story. Evangeline was and remains an icon of Acadian and American culture. The historical Evangeline, who is believed by some to have been an orphan girl named Emmeline Labiche, was purportedly buried on the grounds of St. Martin de Tours Catholic Church in St. Martinville. St. Martin was a very prosperous parish, growing rapidly in the early 1800s. Most of the revenue at that time was being made by raising cattle. Other profitable crops were cotton, sugar, corn, rice and tobacco. These were sold to the New Orleans market. Wealthy planters used enslaved African Americans as labor on their plantations, and by 1860, there were over 7,000 slaves in the parish; there were also a large number of Anglo-American slaves brought to the parish. A yellow fever epidemic in 1855, followed by a deadly fire and a destructive hurricane, ended an era of unbridled prosperity for elite whites. These events, combined with the effects of the American Civil War and Reconstruction took a heavy toll on the parish. ==Geography== The parish of St. Martin is split into two non-contiguous parts because of a surveying error dating to 1868, when Iberia Parish was created by the Louisiana Legislature. Iberia Parish divides St. Martin Parish into two separate areas, Upper and Lower St. Martin. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the parish has a total area of , of which is land and (9.7%) is water. St. Martin Parish is in the Atchafalaya Basin, with Bayou Teche running through it. The bayou was used to ship products to New Orleans. St. Martin Parish has a wealth of oak and magnolia trees. ===Adjacent parishes=== ; Upper St. Martin * Lafayette Parish (west) * St. Landry Parish (north) * Pointe Coupee Parish (northeast) * Iberville Parish (east) * Iberia Parish (south) ; Lower St. Martin * Iberia Parish (north) * Assumption Parish (southeast) * St. Mary Parish (south) ===Protected areas=== The parish has both national and state protected areas within its borders. ====National protected area==== * Atchafalaya National Wildlife Refuge (part) ====State protected areas==== Part of the Attakapas Wildlife Management Area is located within St. Martin Parish as well as in St. Mary and Iberia parishes.Attakapas WMA- Retrieved 2017-02-19 === Communities === thumb|250px|Map of St. Martin Parish, Louisiana With Municipal Labels ==== Cities ==== * Breaux Bridge (largest municipality) * Broussard (partial) * St. Martinville (parish seat) ==== Towns ==== * Arnaudville * Henderson ==== Village ==== * Parks ==== Census-designated places ==== * Cade * Catahoula * Cecilia ==== Unincorporated communities ==== * Butte La Rose * Coteau Holmes * Gecko * Nina Station * Ruth ==Demographics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:right\" |+St. Martin Parish racial composition as of 2020 !scope=\"col\"| Race !scope=\"col\"| Number !scope=\"col\"| Percentage |- !scope=\"row\"| White (non-Hispanic) | 32,919 | 63.59% |- !scope=\"row\"| Black or African American (non-Hispanic) | 15,050 | 29.07% |- !scope=\"row\"| Native American | 177 | 0.34% |- !scope=\"row\"| Asian | 440 | 0.85% |- !scope=\"row\"| Pacific Islander | 3 | 0.01% |- !scope=\"row\"| Other/Mixed | 1,499 | 2.9% |- !scope=\"row\"| Hispanic or Latino | 1,679 | 3.24% |} At the 2000 United States census, there were 48,583 people, 17,164 households, and 12,975 families residing in the parish.
