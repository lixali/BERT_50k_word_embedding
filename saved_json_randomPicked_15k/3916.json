 "text": "The bass guitar, electric bass or simply bass, is the lowest-pitched member of the guitar family. It is a plucked string instrument similar in appearance and construction to an electric or an acoustic guitar, but with a longer neck and scale length, and typically four to six strings or courses. Since the mid-1950s, the bass guitar has largely replaced the double bass in popular music. The four-string bass is usually tuned the same as the double bass, which corresponds to pitches one octave lower than the four lowest-pitched strings of a guitar (E, A, D, and G). It is played primarily with the fingers or thumb, or with a pick. To be heard at normal performance volumes, electric basses require external amplification. == Terminology == According to the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, an \"Electric bass guitar [is] a Guitar, usually with four heavy strings tuned E1'–A1'–D2–G2.\" It also defines bass as \"Bass (iv). A contraction of Double bass or Electric bass guitar.\" According to some authors the proper term is \"electric bass\". Common names for the instrument are \"bass guitar\", \"electric bass guitar\", and \"electric bass\" and some authors claim that they are historically accurate. As the electric alternative to a double bass (which is not a guitar), many manufacturers such as Fender list the instrument in the electric bass category rather than the guitar category. Like the double bass, the bass guitar is a transposing instrument, as it is notated in bass clef an octave higher than it sounds, to reduce the need for ledger lines in music written for the instrument, and simplify reading. === Scale === The scale of the bass is located along the length of the string and forms what is known as the fingerboard. The scale can range in length but is traditionally 34-35 inches long while \"short scale\" bass guitars are usually between 30-32 inches. Short scale bass guitars are made for beginners and younger people since the frets are closer together and easier to play. Long scale bass guitars are known as traditional bass guitars and tend to produce a more defined sound than short scale basses. === Pickup === Bass pickups are generally attached to the body of the guitar and located beneath the strings. They often come in a black, rectangular shape and are responsible for translating the physical energy from a person plucking the strings, to electrical energy that is sent to an amplifier to create sound. There are several different kinds of bass pickups that exist, such as single- coil, double-coil, split coil, piezo, and optical pickups. All of these pickups are seen commonly, yet are all used for separate purposes. Single-coil pickups produce a fine tone but tends to create a buzzing noise. Double-coil pickups and split-coil pickups are designed to eliminate that buzzing noise and are larger in size. Piezo pickups are normally found on acoustic guitars and don't rely on magnets to help produce sound. Optical pickups are the newest kind of pickups available for bass guitars which uses infrared detectors that create sound using the changes in size and shape of the shadow of the string. === Strings === Bass guitar strings are made up of two main components: the core and the winding. The core is the central wire that runs through the center of the string and is generally made up of steel, nickel or some alloy. The difference in material can have an effect on the sound of the bass guitar. There are four main methods of string winding: roundwound, flatwound, tapewound, and groundwound (half-round). The difference in winding also has an impact on the sound of the bass guitar, but the most commonly found winding is the roundwound, which involves the core wire being wrapped with another round-shaped wire. Roundwound strings are the most popular form of strings on bass guitars and are known for producing a more harmonic tone. The next most common string found on bass guitars are flatwound strings. Flatwound strings are known for a smoother sound and feel compared to roundwound strings. Tapewound strings are similar to flatwound strings except, tapewound strings are wrapped in a non-metal material, such as nylon, giving an even slicker feel and a fuzzier tone. Groundwound strings, also known as half-wound strings, are known for incorporating elements from both roundwound and flatwound strings. They are less common but are made to generate a brighter sounding flatwound string. == History == === 1930s === In the 1930s, musician and inventor Paul Tutmarc of Seattle, Washington, developed the first electric bass guitar in its modern form, a fretted instrument designed to be played horizontally. The 1935 sales catalog for Tutmarc's company Audiovox featured his \"Model 736 Bass Fiddle\", a solid-bodied electric bass guitar with four strings, a scale length, and a single pickup. Around 100 were made during this period. Audiovox also sold their “Model 236” bass amplifier. === 1950s === In the 1950s, Leo Fender and George Fullerton developed the first mass- produced electric bass guitar. The Fender Electric Instrument Manufacturing Company began producing the Precision Bass, or P-Bass, in October 1951. The design featured a simple uncontoured \"slab\" body design and a single coil pickup similar to that of a Telecaster. By 1957 the Precision more closely resembled the Fender Stratocaster with the body edges beveled for comfort, and the pickup was changed to a split coil design. thumb|right|upright|Design patent issued to Leo Fender for the second-generation Precision Bass The Fender Bass was a revolutionary instrument for gigging musicians. In comparison with the large, heavy upright bass, which had been the main bass instrument in popular music from the early 20th century to the 1940s, the bass guitar could be easily transported to shows. When amplified, the bass guitar was also less prone than acoustic basses to unwanted audio feedback. The addition of frets enabled bassists to play in tune more easily than on fretless acoustic or electric upright basses, and allowed guitarists to more easily transition to the instrument. In 1953, Monk Montgomery became the first bassist to tour with the Fender bass, in Lionel Hampton's postwar big band. Montgomery was also possibly the first to record with the electric bass, on July 2, 1953, with the Art Farmer Septet. Roy Johnson (with Lionel Hampton), and Shifty Henry (with Louis Jordan and His Tympany Five), were other early Fender bass pioneers. Bill Black, who played with Elvis Presley, switched from upright bass to the Fender Precision Bass around 1957. The bass guitar was intended to appeal to guitarists as well as upright bass players, and many early pioneers of the instrument, such as Carol Kaye, Joe Osborn, and Paul McCartney were originally guitarists. Also in 1953, Gibson released the first short-scale violin-shaped electric bass, the EB-1, with an extendable end pin so a bassist could play it upright or horizontally. In 1958, Gibson released the maple arched-top EB-2 described in the Gibson catalog as a \"hollow-body electric bass that features a Bass/Baritone pushbutton for two different tonal characteristics\". In 1959, these were followed by the more conventional- looking EB-0 Bass. The EB-0 was very similar to a Gibson SG in appearance (although the earliest examples have a slab-sided body shape closer to that of the double-cutaway Les Paul Special). The Fender and Gibson versions used bolt-on and set necks. Several other companies also began manufacturing bass guitars during the 1950s. 1956 saw the appearance at the German trade fair \"Musikmesse Frankfurt\" of the distinctive Höfner 500/1 violin-shaped bass, made using violin construction techniques by Walter Höfner, a second- generation violin luthier. Due to its use by Paul McCartney, it became known as the \"Beatle bass\". In 1957, Rickenbacker introduced the model 4000, the first bass to feature a neck-through-body design in which the neck is part of the body wood. Kay Musical Instrument Company began production of the K-162 in 1952, Danelectro released the Longhorn in 1956, and Burns London/Supersound in 1958. === 1960s === With the explosion in popularity of rock music in the 1960s, many more manufacturers began making electric basses, including Yamaha, Teisco and Guyatone. Introduced in 1960, the Fender Jazz Bass, initially known as the \"Deluxe Bass\", used a body design known as an offset waist which was first seen on the Jazzmaster guitar in an effort to improve comfort while playing seated. The J-bass features two single-coil pickups. Pickup shapes on electric basses are often referred to as \"P\" or \"J\" pickups in reference to the visual and electrical differences between the Precision Bass and Jazz Bass pickups. Providing a more \"Gibson-scale\" instrument, rather than the Jazz and Precision, Fender produced the Mustang Bass, a scale-length instrument. The Fender VI, a 6 string bass, was tuned one octave lower than standard guitar tuning. It was released in 1961, and was briefly favored by Jack Bruce of Cream. Gibson introduced its short-scale EB-3 in 1961, also used by Bruce. The EB-3 had a \"mini-humbucker\" at the bridge position. Gibson basses tended to be instruments with a shorter 30.5\" scale length than the Precision. Gibson did not produce a -scale bass until 1963 with the release of the Thunderbird. === 1970s === In 1972, Alembic established what became known as \"boutique\" or \"high-end\" electric bass guitars. These expensive, custom-tailored instruments, as used by Phil Lesh, Jack Casady, and Stanley Clarke, featured unique designs, premium hand-finished wood bodies, and innovative construction techniques such as multi-laminate neck-through-body construction and graphite necks. Alembic also pioneered the use of onboard electronics for pre- amplification and equalization. Active electronics increase the output of the instrument, and allow more options for controlling tonal flexibility, giving the player the ability to amplify as well as to attenuate certain frequency ranges while improving the overall frequency response (including more low- register and high-register sounds). 1976 saw the UK company Wal begin production of their own range of active basses. In 1974 Music Man Instruments, founded by Tom Walker, Forrest White and Leo Fender, introduced the StingRay, the first widely produced bass with active (powered) electronics built into the instrument. Basses with active electronics can include a preamplifier and knobs for boosting and cutting the low and high frequencies. In the mid-1970s, five-string basses, with a very low \"B\" string, were introduced. In 1975, bassist Anthony Jackson commissioned luthier Carl Thompson to build a six- string bass tuned (low to high) B0, E1, A1, D2, G2, C3, adding a low B string and a high C string. == Fretless bass guitars == thumb|right|A fretless bass with flatwound strings; markers are inlaid into the side of the fingerboard, to aid the performer in finding the correct pitch. While electric bass guitars are traditionally fretted instruments, fretless bass guitars are used by some players to achieve different tones, as well as playing additional micro tones. In 1961, Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman converted a used UK-built Dallas Tuxedo bass by removing the frets and filling in the slots with wood putty. == See also == * Bass guitar tuning * Bass instrument amplification * Bass effects * Pickups * List of bass guitar manufacturers * List of bass guitarists == References == ==Bibliography== * * * * * * * * * * * Category:American inventions Category:American musical instruments Category:Amplified instruments Category:Bass guitars Category:Bass (sound) Category:Blues instruments Category:Contrabass instruments Category:Electric bass guitars Category:Folk music instruments Category:Guitars Category:Jazz instruments Category:Rhythm section Category:Rock music instruments Category:String instruments",
