 "text": "The Canadian Association of Journalists (CAJ; ) is an independent, not-for- profit organization that offers advocacy and professional development to journalists across Canada. The CAJ was created to promote excellence in the craft of journalism and to encourage investigative journalism in Canada. The CAJ presents annual investigative journalism awards including the McGillivray Award and the Charles Bury Award. ==History== The CAJ was founded in 1978 as the Centre for Investigative Journalism (CIJ). A few senior Canadian journalists founded the CIJ to counteract the isolation of the one or two reporters in the average newsroom who did investigative work. One of CIJ's initiatives was the Canadian Committee to Protect Journalists, a press freedom group that later became Canadian Journalists for Free Expression (CJFE). In 1990, the organization changed its name to its current form to reflect a broader emphasis on all journalism and attract additional members. Promoting investigate journalism remains one of the CAJ's main goals. ==Awards== The Canadian Association of Journalists runs an annual awards program recognizing the best in Canadian journalism, with a particular focus on journalism that is investigative in nature. Entries are welcome from any practising journalist whose work has been published or broadcast in Canada. A call for entries is usually issued in December–January, with a deadline in late January or early February. Once judging is complete, a list of the finalists in each category is released. The winning entry in each category is announced as part of the banquet during the annual conference each spring. INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM These categories recognize journalism in a variety of media as set out below. Entries don't have to be purely investigative to qualify; investigative entries are given added weight. Direction to judges include such items as effective use of the medium the entry was published or broadcast in, thoroughness of research, relevance and any outcomes arising from the entry's publication or broadcast. Items based on the same body of research, regardless of which medium they were released in, can only be entered in one category. Entries are awarded in the categories below, with the winner of the Don McGillivray Award for Investigative Journalism chosen from amongst these categories. Open newspaper / wire service Entries welcomed for any article published in a Canadian newspaper or wire service, regardless of circulation or publication frequency. Print articles published exclusively on newspaper websites are also eligible. Community newspaper Entries welcomed for any article published in a Canadian newspaper with an average circulation of under 25,000 or any newspaper published fewer than five times a week. Print articles published exclusively on newspaper websites are also eligible. Magazine Entries welcomed for any article published by a Canadian magazine.

This prize rewards journalism that puts a human face on situations where human rights are not respected and/or holds authorities to account to do a better job of protecting those rights. As a result, the story builds awareness of human rights and social justice issues, and shows the human impact and the human cost of abstract political and economic forces. To qualify, a story must also be international in scope. For examples of human rights reporting, visit www.jhr.ca/success/ The details: The winner receives the opportunity to travel with jhr to one of its African project sites over 14 days. Travel (flights) to the site is provided by jhr, as is on-the-ground travel in the host nation. The CAJ provides the winner a $500 cash prize. The winner agrees to be responsible for covering pre- departure costs (visas, vaccinations, etc.) as well as accommodation costs while in Africa, which are booked in liaison with jhr (est. $1,000+). The winning entrant will be have her/his registration fee to the 2013 CAJ conference waived and be invited to give a presentation sharing the award's experience with CAJ conference delegates. CWA Canada / CAJ Award for Labour Reporting What are labour issues? Judges will be instructed to reward those entries that effectively bring to the public's attention important labour issues. The award seeks to honour journalism that goes beyond a work-to-rule, strike, lockout or other job action and shows skill in reporting on the social, economic and political factors that impact the labour environment in Canada. Entries showing impact on policy, law or public awareness are encouraged. This award is meant to recognize great journalism on labour issues that can make a difference in the lives of Canadians. Does an entry have to be reporting on a union? No– judges are looking for the best journalism on labour issues. While Canada's unions are integral to the labour movement, not all of the labour issues that are reported on in this country involve unions. It's expected many entries will include the labour movement and unions, but this is not a requirement of the award. Entries are encouraged in either official language. Should the judges determine it appropriate, one award may be handed out for reporting done in English and another in French. CAJ / CNW GROUP STUDENT AWARD OF EXCELLENCE The award recognizes excellence in the field of journalism at the student level. Submissions will be accepted from all students enrolled (at the time of publication or broadcast) in an accredited degree/diploma program offered by a Canadian university or college. In addition to awards for professional excellence, the CAJ presents a Code of Silence Award to celebrate \"Canada's rich bureaucratic culture of secrecy.\" At the 'Muck Rake 2004' conference in Vancouver in May, 2004, the federal government Health Canada department won its third Code of Silence award. Winners since then include the federal department of foreign affairs in 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's office in 2009 and the Toronto Police Service in 2010. ==Governance== The CAJ is governed by a board of directors, elected by chapters or through regional or national elections held prior to the annual meeting. Members of the board must be practising journalists as defined by the CAJ bylaws.
