 "text": "Die Tageszeitung (, “The Daily Newspaper”), stylized as die tageszeitung and commonly referred to as taz, is a cooperative-owned German daily newspaper administrated by its employees. Founded in 1978 in Berlin as part of an independent, progressive and politically left-leaning movement, it has focused on current politics, social issues such as inequality, ecological crises both local and international, and other topics not covered by the more traditional and conservative newspapers. It mostly supports the German Green Party, but Die Tageszeitung has also been critical of the SPD/Greens coalition government (1998-2005). The newspaper's logo, a paw print, derives from the similarity of the name \"taz\" to a German word for paw, Tatze. == History == Die Tageszeitung was established in 1978. From the beginning, Die Tageszeitung was intended to be an alternative to the mainstream press, in its own words: \"irreverent, commercially independent, intelligent and entertaining.\" One expression of its alternative approach to journalism was the payment of unified salaries for all employees until 1991. Nowadays, employees in highly responsible positions receive bonuses. Still, salaries paid by Die Tageszeitung are considerably lower than what is paid in the rest of the industry. Since 1995, the WOZ Die Wochenzeitung (formerly WoZ) and Die Tageszeitung add a German-language edition of the monthly Le Monde diplomatique as a supplement of the newspapers. Most of the articles in the monthly supplement are translations of the French language edition of the Le Monde diplomatique. Since 1992, Die Tageszeitung has been owned by currently more than 18,600 paying members. Its circulation has dropped in recent years, with subscriptions including e-paper now down to 42,000. In 1995, it was the first German national newspaper to make all of the content of issue available online. Die Tageszeitung has announced that it will phase out its printed daily edition until 2022. From the beginning, Die Tageszeitung appeared in a nationwide edition as well as in a Berlin local edition. Over the years, local editorial offices for North Rhine-Westphalia, Hamburg and Bremen were added. While the latter two were merged to \"taz nord\" (North) the NRW-offices were closed as of July 2007. In the 2013 elections the magazine was among the supporters of the SPD. ==\"Potato Affair\"== On 26 June 2006 Die Tageszeitung published a satirical article on its last page, headlined Die Wahrheit (the truth) that is reserved for satire and nonsense. It was titled Polens neue Kartoffel. Schurken, die die Welt beherrschen wollen. Heute: Lech „Katsche“ Kaczynski (The new potato of Poland. Rogues who want to rule the world. Today: Lech „Katsche“ Kaczynski).Polens neue Kartoffel. In: taz, 26 June 2006. This article ridiculed the Polish politicians President of Poland Lech Kaczyński and Prime Minister of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński. Lech Kaczyński then cancelled talks that were scheduled between Germany, Poland and France (the Weimar Triangle), officially for reasons of sickness. ==Headlines== The taz is noted for its tongue-in-cheek headlines, such as: * Oh mein Gott! (Oh my god!) – On the election of Joseph Ratzinger as Pope Benedict XVI * Es ist ein Mädchen (It's a girl) – On the election of Angela Merkel as the first female Chancellor of Germany * Oops – they did it again! – On the re-election of George W. Bush as President of the United States On 5 June 2008, the paper published a picture headlined \"Onkel Baracks Hütte\" (Uncle Barack's Cabin) with a picture of the White House below the headline as part of an article about then-Senator Barack Obama. That headline, which made reference to the book Uncle Tom's Cabin, was perceived as racist by some of its readership.Is \"Uncle Barack's Cabin\" racist? ==See also== thumb|Former seat of Die Tageszeitung in the Rudi-Dutschke-Strasse in the Berlin district of Kreuzberg * List of newspapers in Germany * Friede sei mit Dir * Die Datenschleuder *Bascha Mika ==Footnotes== ==Literature== * taz - die tageszeitung.
