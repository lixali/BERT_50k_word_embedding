The town of Johnstown is located on the southern border of the county. It borders on three sides the city of Johnstown and the city of Gloversville. == History == Johnstown was founded by William Johnson, a British military officer and colonial government official, in a region once known as \"Kingsborough\". Johnson named the settlement after his son, John Johnson, and by 1762 constructed a baronial hall. In 1781, during the American Revolution, colonial forces, consisting of militia and Oneida allies, were victorious over a mixed force of Loyalists and Native allies. All of the holdings of the Johnson family were forfeited due to the family's allegiance to Britain. The town of Johnstown was formed in 1793 from the town of Caughnawaga and served as the seat of sprawling Montgomery County, which encompassed a major portion of upstate New York. The town was divided afterwards to form new towns in the county: Mohawk (1837 and now in Montgomery County), Bleecker (1831), and Caroga (1842). In 1772, Johnson constructed a courthouse and jail, partly at his own expense, leading to further development. The core of the town was incorporated as a village in 1808. Later, in 1895, the village was chartered as the city of Johnstown. The town was early involved in the tanning of leather and manufacture of leather goods, primarily gloves. ==Geography== According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.52%, is water.
