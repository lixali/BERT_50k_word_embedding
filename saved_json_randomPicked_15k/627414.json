 "text": "Shine On is a nine-CD box set by English progressive rock band Pink Floyd, released in 1992 through EMI Records in the United Kingdom and Columbia Records in the United States, to coincide with Pink Floyd's 25th anniversary as a recording and touring band. All CDs were digitally remastered. == Content == The eight albums included in this box set are: *A Saucerful of Secrets *Meddle *The Dark Side of the Moon *Wish You Were Here *Animals *The Wall *A Momentary Lapse of Reason *The Early Singles (bonus CD, unavailable elsewhere) Refer to original albums for track lists, personnel lists and production credits. The packaging on each of the previously released albums was unique to this set, with each CD housed in a solid black jewel case with a small sticker of the album cover affixed to the front. When lined up in order of release, the spines of the eight CD cases displayed the prism image from the cover of The Dark Side of the Moon. Included with the box set was a hardcover book chronicling the career of Pink Floyd, from its inception to the late 1980s, and an envelope of postcards depicting artwork from the included seven albums and the cover of the box set itself. As the collection was meant to showcase the best of Pink Floyd, the decision was made to not include the soundtrack albums More or Obscured by Clouds, or the albums Ummagumma, Atom Heart Mother and The Final Cut. The band's first album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, was also omitted, as EMI were planning to release a special edition of the album at the time, and it was hoped that new fans would buy both this set and the re-released debut album. David Gilmour said the title of the Shine On box set (taken from the Wish You Were Here track \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\") was not meant to indicate retirement on the band's part but rather a continuation of the band's progress. According to drummer Nick Mason, an initial suggestion for the title of the set was The Big Bong Theory.U.S. radio show Rockline, 1992 ===The Early Singles=== Shine On contained a bonus CD which compiled, for the first time ever, the band's first five 7\" single A- and B-sides, in their original mono mixes. Some promotional copies of the disc were also issued separately to radio stations. Unlike the other discs in the box set, The Early Singles was housed in a digipak case. ====Track listing==== ====Original release dates==== *Tracks 1 & 2: 11 March 1967 *Tracks 3 & 4: 17 June 1967 *Tracks 5 & 6: 18 November 1967 *Tracks 7 & 8: 13 April 1968 *Tracks 9 & 10: 17 December 1968 ==Personnel== *Richard Wright – piano; organ; mellotron on 7, 8; vibraphone on 10; vocals on 6, 7; backing vocals on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9 *Syd Barrett – guitar on 1 to 6; vocals on 1 to 5; backing vocals on 6 *David Gilmour – guitar on 7 to 10; vocals on 8, 9, 10; backing vocals on 7 *Roger Waters – bass guitar; vocals on 9, 10; backing vocals on 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 *Nick Mason – drums, percussion Production *James Guthrie – remastering production *Alan Parsons – assistant remastering on the included release of The Dark Side of the Moon *Aubrey Powell – sleeve design *Doug Sax – remastering *Storm Thorgerson – sleeve design ==References== Category:Albums produced by David Gilmour Category:Albums produced by Joe Boyd Category:Albums produced by Nick Mason Category:Albums produced by Norman Smith (record producer) Category:Albums produced by Richard Wright (musician) Category:Albums produced by Roger Waters Category:Albums with cover art by Storm Thorgerson Category:Pink Floyd compilation albums Category:1992 compilation albums Category:Columbia Records compilation albums Category:EMI Records compilation albums Category:Albums recorded at A&M; Studios Category:Albums recorded at Morgan Sound Studios Category:Albums recorded at CBS 30th Street Studio Category:Albums recorded at Studio Miraval",
