 "text": "is a weekly shōnen manga magazine published in Japan by Shogakukan since March 1959. Contrary to its title, Weekly Shōnen Sunday issues are released on Wednesdays. Weekly Shōnen Sunday has sold over 1.8billion copies since 1986, making it the fourth best selling manga magazine, only behind Weekly Shōnen Jump, Weekly Shōnen Magazine and Weekly Young Jump. ==History== Weekly Shōnen Sunday was first published on March 17, 1959, as a response to its rival Weekly Shōnen Magazine. The debut issue featured Shigeo Nagashima, the star player of the Yomiuri Giants on the cover, and a congratulatory article by Isoko Hatano, a noted child psychologist. Despite its name, Weekly Shōnen Sunday was originally published on Tuesdays of each week, switching to Wednesdays in 2011. The \"Sunday\" in the name was the creation of its first editor, Kiichi Toyoda, who wanted the title to be evocative of a relaxing weekend. thumb|left|Weekly Shōnen Sunday's mascot, Issue 1991-#37 Weekly Shōnen Sunday's distinctive \"pointing finger\" that appears in the lower corner of every page on the left side of the magazine made its subtle debut in the 4/5 issue from 1969. This understated feature, ever present but easily overlooked, was referenced as a plot element in 20th Century Boys. Sunday's more noticeable mascot, a helmeted fish debuted in the 1980s. Prior to the 1990s and 2000s no serial in Weekly Shōnen Sunday had run over 40 volumes, but that began to change with series such as Detective Conan, Major, Inuyasha, Karakuri Circus, Shijō Saikyō no Deshi Kenichi, Hayate the Combat Butler, Zettai Karen Children and Be Blues!, which maintained a high level of popularity. In a rare event due to the closeness of the two magazine's founding dates, Weekly Shōnen Sunday and Weekly Shōnen Magazine released a special combined issue on March 19, 2008. In addition, other commemorative events, merchandise, and manga crossovers were planned for the following year as part of the celebrations. The book Shonen Sunday 1983 was published on July 15, 2009 to celebrate the anniversary and the magazines heyday. It reprints manga from 1983, such as Urusei Yatsura and Touch, and has interviews with their creators as well as artists who were inspired by the series from that period, such as Gosho Aoyama. To celebrate Weekly Shōnen Sunday's 55th anniversary, 55 new manga series were launched in the print and online magazines Weekly Shonen Sunday, Shōnen Sunday S, Ura Sunday, and Club Sunday throughout the year beginning in March 2014. ==Features== === Series === There are currently twenty-nine manga titles being serialized in Weekly Shōnen Sunday. Out of them, Ad Astra per Aspera and Major 2nd are on hiatus; Magic Kaito is infrequently published; and Case Closed and Detective Conan: Zero's Tea Time are serialized on an irregular basis. {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"background: #FFF;\" |- !Series title !Author !Premiered |- | |Kenjiro Hata | |- | |Hikaru Nikaidō | |- | |Yū Watase | |- | |Norihiro Yagi | |- | |Motoyuki Tanaka | |- | |Kotoyama | |- | |Gosho Aoyama | |- | |Michiteru Kusaba | |- | |Takahiro Arai, Gosho Aoyama | |- | |Kenjiro Hata | |- | |Kanehito Yamada, Tsukasa Abe | |- | |Okiraku Boy | |- | |Mizuki Kuriyama | |- | |Sei Fukui | |- | |Syun Matsuena | |- | |Tomohito Oda | |- | |Wakabi Asayama | |- | |Gosho Aoyama | |- | |Aya Hirakawa | |- | |Aiko Koyama | |- |Major 2nd |Takuya Mitsuda | |- |Mao |Rumiko Takahashi | |- | |Atsushi Namikiri | |- | |Mitsuharu Yanamoto | |- | ||Kōji Kumeta | |- | |Yuhei Kusakabe | |- | |Kagiji Kumanomata | |- | |Yūji Yokoyama | |- | |Yomogi Mogi | |- |} ==Circulation== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ !
