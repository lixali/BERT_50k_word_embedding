 "text": "The Colour of Spring is the third studio album by English band Talk Talk, released in February 1986. ==Composition== Musically, The Colour of Spring was a major step away from the synthesised pop of early Talk Talk, with a greater focus on guitars, pianos, and organs on such songs as \"Life's What You Make It\", \"Living in Another World\" and \"Give It Up\". It had a sound described by the band as much more organic than their earlier records, with the improvisation that was to dominate on their later works already apparent in the recording process. ==Writing and recording== The songwriting was a collaboration between Mark Hollis and producer Tim Friese-Greene. The recording of the album started in January 1985 and took a year to be completed. ==Cover== The album cover was designed by James Marsh, who also designed the band's other album covers. The cover depicts various moths crowded close together, two of which are positioned to form a face. ==Reception== The Colour of Spring became the band's highest selling non- compilation studio album, reaching the Top 20 in numerous countries (topping the Dutch charts), including the UK, where it reached No. 8 and stayed in the UK charts for 21 weeks.David Roberts British Hit Singles and Albums, Guinness World Records Limited It did not quite match the sales of its predecessor in the United States but was nonetheless their last album to enter the Billboard 200, reaching number 58. With the international hit \"Life's What You Make It\", Talk Talk expanded their fan base. The song became the band's third of three American hits, along with 1984's \"It's My Life\" and \"Such a Shame\". The album was included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits per album notes. ;Talk Talk * Mark Hollis — lead vocals, piano (tracks 3, 5, 6, 7), Variophon (tracks 1, 4 and 7), organ (track 4), Mellotron (track 6), electric guitar (track 8), melodica (track 8) * Lee Harris — drums (except 4, 7) * Paul Webb — bass guitar (tracks 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8), backing vocals (tracks 3 and 5) ;Additional personnel * Tim Friese- Greene — producer, piano (tracks 1, 2, and 8), Kurzweil Synthesizer (tracks 1, 4 and 7), organ (tracks 3, 6 and 8), Variophon (tracks 4 and 7), Mellotron (track 3) * Ian Curnow — synthesizer solos (tracks 2 and 6) * Martin Ditcham — percussion (tracks 1, 3, 5, 6 and 8) * Mark Feltham — harmonica (track 5) * Alan Gorrie — electric bass (track 1) * Robbie McIntosh — guitar (tracks 1, 2, 5 and 8), Dobro (tracks 4 and 6) * Morris Pert — percussion (tracks 1, 2, 5, and 8) * Phil Reis — percussion (track 1) * David Rhodes — guitar (tracks 3, 5, and 6) * David Roach — soprano saxophone (tracks 2, 4, and 5) * Gaynor Sadler — harp (track 2) * Danny Thompson — acoustic bass (track 1) * Children from the school of Miss Speake — children's choir (track 1) * Ambrosian Singers — choir (track 8) * Steve Winwood — organ (tracks 1, 2, and 5) * Dennis Weinrich — engineer * Dietmar Schillinger — engineer * Paul Schroeder — engineer * Pete Wooliscroft — engineer *James Marsh — cover art ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !Chart (1986) !Peak position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 71 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ==Certifications== == References == ==External links== Category:Talk Talk albums Category:1986 albums Category:EMI Records albums Category:Progressive pop albums Category:Experimental pop albums Category:Art pop albums",
