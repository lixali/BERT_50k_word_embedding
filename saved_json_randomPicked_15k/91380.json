The land was originally contested by Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New France and New Netherland, but it remained undelineated until July 20, 1764, when King George III established the boundary between New Hampshire and New York along the west bank of the Connecticut River, north of Massachusetts and south of the parallel of 45 degrees north latitude. New York assigned the land gained to Albany County.Slade, William, Jr., comp.

On September 3, 1783, as a result of the signing of the Treaty of Paris, the Revolutionary War ended with Great Britain recognizing the independence of the United States. Vermont's border with Quebec was established at 45 degrees north latitude,Van Zandt, Franklin K. Boundaries of the United States and the Several States. Geological Survey Professional Paper 909.

Massachusetts did not formally withdraw its claim to the region, first made in 1629, until December 16, 1786.Van Zandt, Franklin K. Boundaries of the United States and the Several States.

New York, still not satisfied with the relinquishment of its land to Vermont, asked the U.S. Congress to arbitrate the matter. Congress ruled against New York on March 7, 1788.New York Laws, 1788, 11th Session, Chapter 63, pp. 746–747. Subsequently, when Vermont petitioned for statehood, Congress ordered a joint commission to settle the border between New York and Vermont. This commission ruled before Vermont's admission, which took place on March 4, 1791, but a small change they permitted has never been acted upon.United States.

Grand Isle County was created in 1802 from parts of Franklin and Chittenden Counties. In the late 19th century the Rutland Railroad ran service from northern New York State by the Canada–U.S. border, along the west side of Vermont to Rutland, Vermont, and south to Chatham, New York. From 1899 a series of causeways provided continuous train service north–south through the Lake Champlain islands, making a direct connection to Burlington. The last service from Alburgh was in 1948.\"Rutland Railroad\" http://www.r2parks.net/RUT.html ==Geography== According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (58%) is water. It has the highest proportion of water coverage of any county in the state. It is the smallest county in Vermont by area, and the second-smallest by population (only Essex County has fewer people). Four of its five towns (North Hero, South Hero, Grand Isle and Isle La Motte) are situated entirely on islands in Lake Champlain, while Alburgh is on a peninsula (an exclave known as the Alburgh Tongue) extending south into the lake from Quebec. The highest elevation in the county is only 279 feet, on the west side of South Hero. The lake shoreline elevation is generally 99' above sea level. ===Adjacent counties=== * Franklin County – east * Chittenden County – southeast * Clinton County, New York – west * Le Haut-Richelieu Regional County Municipality, Quebec – north ===Major highways=== * * * * ==Demographics== ===2000 census=== As of the census of 2000, there were 6,901 people, 2,761 households, and 1,954 families living in the county.
