 "text": "This timeline of clothing and textiles technology covers the events of fiber and flexible woven material worn on the body; including making, modification, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, and manufacturing systems (technology). ==Fibers and Fabrics== * Scientists are still investigating and debating when people started wearing clothes *c. 50000 BC – A discovered twisted fibre (a 3-ply cord fragment) indicates the likely use of clothing, bags, nets and similar technology by Neanderthals in southeastern France. *c. 27000 BC – Impressions of textiles and basketry and nets left on small pieces of hard clay in Europe. *c. 25000 BC – Venus figurines depicted with clothing. *c. 8000 BC – Evidence of flax cultivation in the Near East.Cambridge History of Western Textiles p. 39-47 *c. 6000 BC – Evidence of woven textiles used to wrap the dead at Çatalhöyük in Anatolia.'' *c. 3000 BC – Breeding of domesticated sheep with a wooly fleece rather than hair in the Near East. *c. 2500 BC – The Indus Valley Civilisation cultivates cotton in the Indian subcontinent. *c. 1988 BC – Production of linen cloth in Ancient Egypt, along with other bast fibers including rush, reed, palm, and papyrus.Cambridge History of Western Textiles p. 30-39 *c. 1000 BC - Cherchen Man was laid to rest with a twill tunic and the earliest known sample of tartan fabric. *c. 200 AD – Earliest woodblock printing from China.
