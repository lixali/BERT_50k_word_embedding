 "text": "In complex analysis, a removable singularity of a holomorphic function is a point at which the function is undefined, but it is possible to redefine the function at that point in such a way that the resulting function is regular in a neighbourhood of that point. For instance, the (unnormalized) sinc function : \\text{sinc}(z) = \\frac{\\sin z}{z} has a singularity at z = 0. This singularity can be removed by defining \\text{sinc}(0) := 1, which is the limit of \\text{sinc} as z tends to 0. The resulting function is holomorphic. In this case the problem was caused by \\text{sinc} being given an indeterminate form. Taking a power series expansion for \\frac{\\sin(z)}{z} around the singular point shows that : \\text{sinc}(z) = \\frac{1}{z}\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^kz^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!} \\right) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^kz^{2k}}{(2k+1)!} = 1 - \\frac{z^2}{3!} + \\frac{z^4}{5!} - \\frac{z^6}{7!} + \\cdots. Formally, if U \\subset \\mathbb C is an open subset of the complex plane \\mathbb C, a \\in U a point of U, and f: U\\setminus \\\\{a\\\\} \\rightarrow \\mathbb C is a holomorphic function, then a is called a removable singularity for f if there exists a holomorphic function g: U \\rightarrow \\mathbb C which coincides with f on U\\setminus \\\\{a\\\\}. We say f is holomorphically extendable over U if such a g exists. == Riemann's theorem == Riemann's theorem on removable singularities is as follows: The implications 1 ⇒ 2 ⇒ 3 ⇒ 4 are trivial. To prove 4 ⇒ 1, we first recall that the holomorphy of a function at a is equivalent to it being analytic at a (proof), i.e. having a power series representation. Define : h(z) = \\begin{cases} (z - a)^2 f(z) & z e a ,\\\\\\ 0 & z = a . \\end{cases} Clearly, h is holomorphic on D \\setminus \\\\{a\\\\}, and there exists :h'(a)=\\lim_{z\\to a}\\frac{(z - a)^2f(z)-0}{z-a}=\\lim_{z\\to a}(z - a) f(z)=0 by 4, hence h is holomorphic on D and has a Taylor series about a: :h(z) = c_0 + c_1(z-a) + c_2 (z - a)^2 + c_3 (z - a)^3 + \\cdots \\, . We have c0 = h(a) = 0 and c1 = h(a) = 0; therefore :h(z) = c_2 (z - a)^2 + c_3 (z - a)^3 + \\cdots \\, . Hence, where z ≠ a, we have: :f(z) = \\frac{h(z)}{(z - a)^2} = c_2 + c_3 (z - a) + \\cdots \\, . However, :g(z) = c_2 + c_3 (z - a) + \\cdots \\, . is holomorphic on D, thus an extension of f. == Other kinds of singularities == Unlike functions of a real variable, holomorphic functions are sufficiently rigid that their isolated singularities can be completely classified. A holomorphic function's singularity is either not really a singularity at all, i.e. a removable singularity, or one of the following two types: #In light of Riemann's theorem, given a non-removable singularity, one might ask whether there exists a natural number m such that \\lim_{z \\rightarrow a}(z-a)^{m+1}f(z)=0. If so, a is called a pole of f and the smallest such m is the order of a. So removable singularities are precisely the poles of order 0. A holomorphic function blows up uniformly near its other poles. #If an isolated singularity a of f is neither removable nor a pole, it is called an essential singularity. The Great Picard Theorem shows that such an f maps every punctured open neighborhood U \\setminus \\\\{a\\\\} to the entire complex plane, with the possible exception of at most one point. ==See also== * Analytic capacity * Removable discontinuity == External links == *Removable singular point at Encyclopedia of Mathematics Category:Analytic functions Category:Meromorphic functions Category:Bernhard Riemann",
