Its many awards garnered include Best Actress at the 14th Hong Kong Film Awards for Yuen and Best Original Song for \"Chase\" by Cheung.

The theme song \"Chase\" (追) appeared on Cheung's 1995 album Most Beloved. ==Plot== Wing (Anita Yuen) is a sassy girl who deeply idolizes Rose (Carina Lau), a pop singer, and Rose's boyfriend, top record producer and songwriter Sam (Leslie Cheung). Rose has been groomed by Sam, achieving stardom and international acclaim. With her success, Sam decides to try his hand at bringing up a male singer. He decides to announce a country- wide, males-only talent search, much to his former protégé's chagrin. Wing, desperate to meet her idols, seizes this opportunity and enters the contest disguised as a male. Her childhood friend (Jordan Chan) trains her to perfect this whimsical idea. As fate would have it, Wing succeeds in the audition thanks to the poor quality of those auditioning and in part to Rose's taunts. Rose challenges Sam to see to the idea of him bringing up a (relatively) talentless Wing. Wing is later invited to stay at Sam and Rose's home for her/\"his\" musical education. Wing tries unsuccessfully to reconcile the two lovers' difference. Trouble and comedy ensue as she finds herself falling for Sam and vice versa, despite him thinking she is a he. ==Cast== * Leslie Cheung as Sam Koo Ka-ming * Carina Lau as Rose * Anita Yuen as Lam Chi-wing * Eric Tsang as Auntie * Lawrence Cheng as Charles Chow Chu * Law Kar-ying as Joseph * Jordan Chan as Yu Lo * Jerry Lamb as George * Cheung Suet-ling as Alice * Clarence Hui as Wing's vocal instructor * Nelson Cheung as Face at party (cameo) * Patrick Tsui as Paul * Joe Cheung as Peter * Mantic Yiu as Peter's wife * Jacob Cheung as MTV Director * Lee Ho-lam as Roger * Ng Chin-yan as Busty Lin * Matthew Tang as Building security guard * Chan Wai-lung as Wing's dance instructor * Chen Yong-liang as Audition judge * Liu Fung-pinh as Audition judge * Irene as Audition judge * May Lam as Rose's mahjong friend * Julian as Rose's mahjong friend * Leung Yiu-hei as Audition contestant #1 * Yu Tin-lok as Audition contestant #2 * Tsang Ho-yin as Audition contestant #3 * Yu Dai-keung as Audition contestant #4 * Fung Ka-leung as Audition contestant #5 * Tse Pak-chuen as Audition contestant #6 * Ng Ming-wai as Audition contestant #7 * Lai Wing-yan as Audition contestant #8 * Osman Hung as Audition contestant #9 * Chu Ka-yiu as Audition contestant #10 * Tang Chi-sam as Audition contestant #11 * Jason Lee Jones as Audition contestant #12 * Jimmy Lee as Audition contestant #13 * Chan Chi-ban as Old band member * Wong Sek-ning as Old band member * Winston Yeh as Old band member * Hui Sek-hung as Old band member * Cipriano Antonio as Old band member * Pete Spurrier as Wine bar patron (uncredited) ==Awards and nominations== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" ; |- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\" ! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background: LightSteelBlue;\" | Awards and nominations |- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\" ! style=\"background:#ccc| Ceremony ! style=\"background:#ccc| Category ! style=\"background:#ccc| Recipient ! style=\"background:#ccc| Outcome |- |rowspan=11|14th Hong Kong Film Awards |Best Film |He's a Woman, She's a Man | |- |Best Director |Peter Chan | |- |Best Screenplay |James Yuen | |- |Best Actor |Leslie Cheung | |- |Best Actress |Anita Yuen | |- |Best Supporting Actor |Jordan Chan | |- |Best New Performer |Jordan Chan | |- |Best Art Direction |Chung Man-kei | |- |Best Costume & Make Up Design |Dora Ng | |- |Best Original Film Score |Clarence Hui, Chiu Tsang-hei | |- |Best Original Film Song |Song: Chase (追) Composer: Dick Lee Lyricist: Lin Xi Singer: Leslie Cheung | |- |} ==See also== * Cross-dressing in film and television ==External links== * IMDb entry * HK cinemagic entry Category:Hong Kong films Category:1994 films Category:1994 romantic comedy films Category:Hong Kong romantic comedy films Category:Hong Kong LGBT-related films Category:1990s Cantonese-language films Category:Films directed by Peter Chan Category:Films about singers Category:Cross-dressing in film Category:Films set in Hong Kong Category:Films shot in Hong Kong Category:Films with screenplays by James Yuen Category:LGBT-related romantic comedy films Category:1994 LGBT-related films",
