 "text": "Upper Egypt ( , shortened to , , locally: ; ) is the southern portion of Egypt and is composed of the lands on both sides of the Nile that extend downriver between Nubia and Lower Egypt in the north. In ancient Egypt, Upper Egypt was known as tꜣ šmꜣw, literally \"the Land of Reeds\" or \"the Sedgeland\". It is believed to have been united by the rulers of the supposed Thinite Confederacy who absorbed their rival city states during Naqada III and its unification with Lower Egypt ushered in the Early Dynastic period.Brink, Edwin C.

Both Upper and Lower Egypt became imbedded within the symbolism of the sovereignty in Ancient Egypt such as the Pschent double crown.Griffith, Francis Llewellyn, A Collection of Hieroglyphs: A Contribution to the History of Egyptian Writing, the Egypt Exploration Fund 1898, p.56 Upper Egypt remained as a historical distinction even after the classical period. ==Geography== Upper Egypt is between the Cataracts of the Nile beyond modern- day Aswan, downriver (northward) to the area of El-Ayait,See list of nomes.

The northern (downriver) part of Upper Egypt, between Sohag and El-Ayait, is also known as Middle Egypt. In Arabic, inhabitants of Upper Egypt are known as Sa'idis and they generally speak Sai'idi Egyptian Arabic. thumb|upright|center|Map of Ancient Egypt with its historical nomes, \"Upper Egypt\" is in the lower portion of the map ==History== ===Predynastic Egypt=== The main city of prehistoric Upper Egypt was Nekhen. The patron deity was the goddess Nekhbet, who is depicted as a vulture. By approximately 3600 BC, Neolithic Egyptian societies along the Nile had based their culture on the raising of crops and the domestication of animals. Shortly after 3600 BC, Egyptian society began to grow and increase in complexity. A new and distinctive pottery, which was related to the Levantine ceramics, appeared during this time. Extensive use of copper became common during this time. The Mesopotamian process of sun-drying adobe and architectural principles—including the use of the arch and recessed walls for decorative effect—became popular during this time. Concurrent with these cultural advances, a process of unification of the societies and towns of the upper Nile River, or Upper Egypt, occurred. At the same time the societies of the Nile Delta, or Lower Egypt, also underwent a unification process. Warfare between Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt occurred often. During his reign in Upper Egypt, King Narmer defeated his enemies on the delta and united both of the kingdoms of Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt under his single rule, which endured throughout Dynastic Egypt. ===Dynastic Egypt=== For most of Egypt's ancient history, Thebes was the administrative center of Upper Egypt. Upper Egypt was represented by the tall White Crown Hedjet, and its symbols were the flowering lotus and the sedge. Its patron deity, Nekhbet, was depicted by the vulture. After unification of the two kingdoms, the patron deities of both Lower Egypt and Upper Egypt were represented together as the Two Ladies, to protect all of the ancient Egyptians, just as the two crowns became united throughout the dynasties that followed. After its devastation by the Assyrians, the importance of Egypt declined. Under the Ptolemies, Ptolemais Hermiou took over the role of the capital city of Upper Egypt. ===Medieval Egypt=== In the eleventh century, large numbers of pastoralists, known as Hilalians, fled Upper Egypt and moved westward into Libya and as far as Tunis. It is believed that degraded grazing conditions in Upper Egypt, associated with the beginning of the Medieval Warm Period, were the root cause of the migration. ===20th- century Egypt=== In the twentieth-century Egypt, the title Prince of the Sa'id (meaning Prince of Upper Egypt) was used by the heir apparent to the Egyptian throne. Although the Kingdom of Egypt was abolished after the Egyptian revolution of 1952, the title continues to be used by Muhammad Ali, Prince of the Sa'id. ==List of rulers of prehistoric Upper Egypt== The following list may not be complete (there are many more of uncertain existence): {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! width=\"15%\" | Name ! width=\"15%\" | Image ! width=\"50%\" | Comments ! width=\"20%\" | Dates |- | Elephant | | | End of 4th millennium BC |- | Bull | | | 4th millennium BC |- | Scorpion I | | Oldest tomb at Umm el- Qa'ab had scorpion insignia | c. 3200 BC? |- | Iry-Hor | 110x110px | Possibly the immediate predecessor of Ka. | c. 3150 BC? |- | Ka | 110x110px | May be read Sekhen rather than Ka.
