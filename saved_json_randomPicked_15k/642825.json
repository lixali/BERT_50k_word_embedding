 "text": "Pope Julian (Yulianus) of Alexandria was the 11th Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria. Julian was known as a wise priest, studying the Bible and \"walking in the path of chastity and religion and tranquillity\". A synod of bishops, together with the laity, in the city of Alexandria, Egypt, appointed him patriarch. He composed homilies and sermons on the saints. The bishop of Alexandria did not remain always in that city, but issued thence secretly, and ordained priests in every place, as Saint Mark, the evangelist, had done. After a reign of ten years, Julian died on the 8th of Paremhat, or on the 12th of Babah. He is commemorated in the Coptic Synaxarium on the 8th day of Paremhat. == References == ;General * *Atiya, Aziz S. The Coptic Encyclopedia.
