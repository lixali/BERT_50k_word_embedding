Soyuz TM-34 was a Russian Soyuz TM passenger transportation craft that was launched by a Soyuz-U rocket from Baikonur at 06:26 UT on 25 April 2002. It carried two cosmonauts and a South African tourist, Mark Shuttleworth, to the International Space Station (ISS). Shuttleworth performed some biology experiments, as he carried a live rat and sheep stem cells. All three returned on Soyuz TM-33 after an eight-day mission. Soyuz TM-34 was the final flight of the Soyuz-TM variant, due to its replacement by the upgraded Soyuz-TMA. It was also the last crewed vehicle to launch atop the Soyuz-U rocket, although the Soyuz-U continued to launch uncrewed vehicles until 2017. == References == Category:Crewed Soyuz missions Category:Spacecraft launched in 2002 Category:Orbital space tourism missions Category:Spacecraft which reentered in 2002 Category:Spacecraft launched by Soyuz-U rockets",
