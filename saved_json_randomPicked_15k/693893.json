 "text": "St Matthew's Catholic School is a Catholic school located in Lewis Street, Mudgee, New South Wales, Australia teaching from Kindergarten to Year 12. ==History== A Catholic school was first established in Mudgee in the 19th century. Leading Australian author Henry Lawson studied there for a time but struggled to find friends due to deafness and left school early. A new school in Mudgee south was finished in April 1912. The same week tenders were called for a new Catholic School. July 1914 saw tenders called for a new high school building completed in 1916. In 1992, part of the school was burnt down by vandals. A new school was rebuilt on the site. The school currently has approximately 600 students in attendance. As of the end of the 2008 school year, a new secondary building has been confirmed and will go from years 7-12. ==References== Category:Catholic primary schools in New South Wales Category:Roman Catholic Diocese of Bathurst in Australia Category:Mudgee, New South Wales Category:Catholic secondary schools in New South Wales",
