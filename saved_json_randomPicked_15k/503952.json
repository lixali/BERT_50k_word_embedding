 "text": "Saint-Augustin () is a station on Line 9 of the Paris Métro. Named after Place Saint-Augustin (itself named after Saint-Augustin church, the station opened on 27 May 1923 with the line's extension from Trocadéro. It is located in the 8th arrondissement. ==History== After the extension of Line 14 to Saint-Lazare opened in 2004, the station was connected to Saint-Lazare Métro station (which is near Saint-Lazare railway station) by a long underground passageway. This allows interchange to Line 14 as advertised on RATP maps. There is also connection to Lines 3, 12 and 13 via the Line 14 platforms, but under normal operating conditions these connections are not useful and are not indicated on RATP maps. ==Nearby== The current Saint-Augustin church, built in 1868 by Baltard, replaced an old chapel which was also dedicated to St Augustine (354–430). ==Station layout== {| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 valign=top|G |style=\"border- top:solid 1px gray;\" width=100 valign=top|Street Level |style=\"border- top:solid 1px gray;\" width=450 valign=top|Exit/Entrance |- |style=\"border- top:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 valign=top|B1 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=100 valign=top|Mezzanine |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=450 valign=top|Fare control |- |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 rowspan=4 valign=top|B2 |style=\"border- top:solid 1px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2| |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=100|Westbound |style=\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=390|← toward Pont de Sèvres |- |Eastbound | toward Mairie de Montreuil → |- |style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border- right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;text-align:center;\" colspan=2| |} ==References== *Roland, Gérard (2003).
