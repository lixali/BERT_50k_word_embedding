The municipalities of Cully, Epesses, Grandvaux, Riex and Villette (Lavaux) merged on 1 July 2011 into the new municipality of Bourg-en-Lavaux.Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz published by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office accessed 17 February 2011 ==History== Traces of a Roman road and coins finds indicate an early settlement in the municipality. Epesses is first mentioned in 1453 as Espesses. The name comes from the Latin word spissa (meaning dense, thick) probably in reference to the spruce. With the conquest by Bern of Vaud in 1536, the village came under the administration of the Bailiwick of Lausanne. After the collapse of the ancien régime, between 1798 and 1803 it was part of the Canton of Léman during the Helvetic Republic and then fell under the Canton of Vaud. In 1798 it was assigned to the district of Lavaux. It was not until 1824, when the community was split from Villette, that Epesses attained the status of an independent political municipality. A project to merge the independent municipalities Cully, Epesses, Riex, Grandvaux, and Villette failed in a vote on 27 February 2005 due to the resistance of the population of Grandvaux. The project is therefore not being pursued. ==Geography== thumb|left|Vine yards at Epesses thumb|Aerial view (1949) Epesses is located at above sea level, east-southeast of the capital of the canton of Lausanne (as the crow flies).
