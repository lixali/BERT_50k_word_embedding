 "text": "The Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky is the head of government of Kentucky,KY Const. art. 69. and serves as commander-in-chief of the state's military forces.KY Const. art. 75. The governor has a duty to enforce state laws;KY Const. art. 81 the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Kentucky General Assembly;KY Const. art. 88. the power to convene the legislature;KY Const. art. 80. and the power to grant pardons, except in cases of treason and impeachment.KY Const. art. 77. He is also empowered to reorganize the state government or reduce it in size. Historically, the office has been regarded as one of the most powerful executive positions in the United States. Fifty-nine individuals have held the office of Governor. Prior to a 1992 amendment to the state's constitution, the Governor was prohibited from succeeding himself in office, though four men (Isaac Shelby, John L. Helm, James B. McCreary and Happy Chandler) served multiple non-consecutive terms. Paul E. Patton, the first Kentucky Governor eligible for a second consecutive term under the amendment, won his reelection bid in 1999. James Garrard succeeded himself in 1800, before the constitutional provision existed. Garrard is also the longest serving Governor, serving for a total period of 8 years and 90 days. William Goebel, who was elected to the office in the disputed election of 1899, remains the only Governor of any U.S. state to die from assassination while in office. Goebel is also the shortest serving Governor, serving for a period of only 3 days. Martha Layne Collins, who held the office from 1983 to 1987, was the first woman to serve as governor and was only the third woman to serve as governor of any U.S. state who was not the wife or widow of a previous governor. The 63rd and current Kentucky Governor is Democrat Andy Beshear, who took office on December 10, 2019. ==Governors== Kentucky was initially Kentucky County in Virginia. It achieved statehood and was admitted to the Union on June 1, 1792; see the list of governors of Virginia for the period before statehood. There have been 59 governors, serving 63 distinct terms. An unelected group proclaimed Kentucky's secession from the Union on November 20, 1861, and it was annexed by the Confederate States of America on December 10, 1861. The Confederate government elected two governors (listed separately), but it never held much control over the state, and the main line of governors was preserved. The original 1792 Kentucky Constitution had the governor chosen by an electoral college for a term of four years.1799 Const. art. II, § 2–3 The second constitution in 1799 changed this to a popular vote, and prevented governors from succeeding themselves within seven years of their terms.1799 Const. art. III, § 3–4 The third constitution in 1850 reduced the succession limitation to four years.1850 Const. art. III, § 3 A 1992 amendment to the constitution allowed governors to have a second term before being prevented from succeeding themselves for four years.KY Const. art. 71 {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |+ Governors of the Commonwealth of Kentucky !scope=\"col\" data- sort-type=\"number\"| !scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"|Governor !scope=\"col\"|Term in office !scope=\"col\"|Party !scope=\"col\"|Election !scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\"|Lt.

This government never successfully displaced the government in Frankfort, and Kentucky remained in the Union through the entire war. Two men were elected governor of the Confederate government: George W. Johnson, who served from November 20, 1861, to his death on April 8, 1862, at the Battle of Shiloh, and, on Johnson's death, Richard Hawes, who served until the Confederate surrender on April 9, 1865. The Confederate government disbanded shortly after the end of the war in 1865. ==See also== * Timeline of Kentucky history ==Notes== ==References== ;General * * * ;Constitution * * * * ;Specific ==External links== *Office of the Governor of Kentucky Category:Lists of state governors of the United States Governors",
