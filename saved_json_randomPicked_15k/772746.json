For most of their existence, they were run by ZAFER Associates, but in latter years were brought under the control of The Radio Academy. The awards were generally referred to by the name of their first sponsor, Sony, as The Sony Awards, The Sony Radio Awards or variations. In August 2013, Sony announced the end of its sponsorship agreement with The Radio Academy after 32 years. Consequently, the awards were named simply The Radio Academy Awards. In November 2014, it was announced that The Radio Academy would not be holding the awards in 2015, and would be looking for other ways to recognise achievement in the future. The awards were relaunched in 2016 as the Audio & Radio Industry Awards (ARIAS). == Awards format == The awards were organised into various categories, with nominees being announced a few weeks before the main awards ceremony. The categories varied slightly each year, and were decided by an annual committee, with the aim to include all the main areas from music, news and speech through to radio drama, comedy and sport, and not discriminating against station size, or niche categories. In most categories, five entries were shortlisted with the top three awarded Bronze, Silver and Gold. Some categories (such as the Station of the Year categories) only three entries were shortlisted, with only a Gold winner awarded. In a number of special categories (such as The Gold Award or Special Award) there was no shortlist, merely a winner. == 2014 Gold Award winners == {| class=\"wikitable\" |Category |Programme Title
