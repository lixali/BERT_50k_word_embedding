University to vote in Waller County.\"2 Voter Rights Cases, One Gripping a College Town, Stir Texas\" by Ralph Blumenthal, New York Times, May 28, 2008\"Judges slap Waller voter rules, give hand to Prairie View\" by Cindy George, Houston Chronicle October 24, 2008 As reported by the US District Court (Southern District of Texas, Corpus Christi Division) in Veasey v Perry, October 2014 (CIVIL ACTION NO. 13-CV-00193), pp 6–7 verbatim: * In 1971, after the 26th Amendment extended the vote to those 18 years old and older, Waller County, which was home to Prairie View A&M; University (PVAMU), a historically Black university, became troubled with race issues. Waller County's tax assessor and voter registrar prohibited students from voting unless they or their families owned property in the county. This practice was ended by a three-judge court in 1979. * In 1992, a county prosecutor indicted PVAMU students for illegally voting, but dropped the charges after receiving a protest from the DOJ. * In 2003, a PVAMU student ran for the commissioner's court. The local district attorney and county attorney threatened to prosecute students for voter fraud—for not meeting the old domicile test. These threatened prosecutions were enjoined, but Waller County then reduced early voting hours, which was particularly harmful to students because the election day was during their spring break. After the NAACP filed suit, Waller County reversed the changes to early voting and the student narrowly won the election. * In 2007–08, during then Senator Barack Obama's campaign for president, Waller County made a number of voting changes without seeking clearance. The county rejected “incomplete” voter registrations and required volunteer deputy registrars (VDRs) to personally find and notify the voters of the rejection. The county also limited the number of new registrations any VDR could submit, thus limiting the success of voter registration drives. These practices were eventually prohibited by a consent decree. In 2018, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund filed a lawsuit in U.S. district court, alleging that the county's early-voting plan unduly limits early voting opportunities for students at Prairie View A&M.;\"Fighting for the Right to Vote in a Tiny Texas County\" by Vann R. Newkirk II and Adam Harris, The Atlantic magazine. On October 10, Jacob Aronowitz, a field director for Democratic U.S. House candidate Mike Siegel, delivered a letter from Siegel, which indicated a solution to attempts to keep students at Prairie View A&M; University from voting, to a clerk on the county executive's staff. As a result, Aronowitz was arrested for what he was told was \"48 hour investigative detention.\" ===Law enforcement=== the current sheriff is Troy Guidry, who was elected in 2020. The previous sheriff was Glenn Smith, who had been sheriff since 2008. Smith was previously chief of the police department of Hempstead, where he had been fired by the town council. after allegations that he and four white officers had exhibited racism and police brutality during the arrest of a 35-year-old black man. Sandra Bland was a 28-year-old woman who was arrested by a Texas State Trooper in Waller County on July 10, 2015, as the result of a traffic stop. According to officials, she committed suicide by hanging in her Waller County Jail cell three days later. This incident garnered national attention and prompted the Texas state legislature to enact the Sandra Bland Act (SB 1849) which encompasses such things as procedures for jail staff, addressing substance abuse of prisoners, the mental health of prisoners, and the completion of a 40-hour Crisis Intervention Training (TCOLE) course for all persons in Texas holding a law enforcement officer's license (Chapter 1701, Occupations Code). In November 2021, a 16 year old was charged with six counts of aggravated assault for crashing into six people on bicycles while attempting to roll coal. All four of the riders were hospitalized for their injuries, two of them being airlifted. According to defense attorneys hired by the injured, the injuries included \"broken vertebrae, cervical and lumbar spinal injuries, broken collar bones, hands, and wrists [requiring surgical intervention], multiple traumatic brain injuries, lacerations, soft tissue damage, road rash, and extensive bruising\" The Waller county district attorney, Elton Mathis, released a statement about the handling of the case by the Waller County police department in which he said \"This case was not handled appropriately by the investigating agency. PERIOD.\" According to his statement, the Texas Department of Public Safety urged the local police to treat the scene as a crime scene, and to contact the district attorney's office. Despite this, the local police released the 16 year old without doing an investigation. ==Education== School districts serving Waller County include: * Hempstead Independent School District * Royal Independent School District * Katy Independent School District (portions of the district are in other counties) * Waller Independent School District (portions of the district are in other counties) Brazos Valley Sudbury School was previously in operation in Waller County.
