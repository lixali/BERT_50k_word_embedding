Filmed on location in Egypt and in Palestine, it tells the story of Jesus' life, interspersed with verses from The Bible. Kalem released the film in October 1912 to critical acclaim. It saw a re-release in February 1919 following Vitagraph Studios' acquisition of Kalem.From the Manger to the Cross at SilentEra == Cast == *Robert Henderson-Bland : Jesus, the man *Percy Dyer : the Boy Jesus *Gene Gauntier : the Virgin Mary *Alice Hollister : Mary Magdalene *Sidney Olcott : Blind Man *Samuel Morgan : Pontius Pilate *James D.

The head of Kalem, Frank J. Marion, presented a copy to the troupe as they departed for the Middle East. According to Turner Classic Movies, the film cost $35,000 to produce (roughly between $1,600,000 and $3,300,000 adjusted to 2007 dollars);Currency comparison table another source says that Olcott spent $100,000 of his own money on the project. Although the film's profits eventually amounted to almost $1 million (roughly $46,000,000 to $95,000,000), the Kalem directors refused to increase Olcott's basic salary and he resigned. In later years, Louis B. Mayer, head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, would say this was the premiere film for his movie theater in Haverhill, Massachusetts and a major boost for him in the movie business.\"Mr. Motion Picture\", Time magazine obituary (November 11, 1957) However, most sources place the release date of this film as 1912, long after the opening of Mayer's theater. At around 5,000 feet it was one of the longer films to be released to date,Kevin Brownlow, 'Silent Films: What Was the Right Speed?' Sight and Sound, Summer 1980, pp. 164-167.James Card, 'Silent Film Speed' Image, October 1955, pp. 55-56. although the Kinemacolor documentary With Our King and Queen Through India released in February 1912 ran to 16,000 feet;McKernan, Luke (2009). 'The modern Elixir of Life: Kinemacolor, royalty and the Delhi Durbar', in Film History, Vol. 21, pp. 122–136, 2009. and another religious film The Miracle (the first full-colour feature film) - was released in the UK at 7,000 feet in December 1912.\"Film show in Covent Garden\". New York Times, 9 December 1912 ==Reception in Britain== The five-reel film showed at the Queen's Hall, London, for eight months (a relatively lengthy run for the time). A statement by Israel Zangwill (founder of the Jewish Territorialist Organization) hailing it as \"An artistic triumph — the kinema put to its true end\" appeared on advertising bills outside the Queen's Hall. From the Manger to the Cross gained considerable publicity from an outcry in the Daily Mail: \"Is nothing sacred to the film maker?\" it demanded, and waxed indignant about the profits for its American investors. Although the clergy were invited and found little to be affronted by, the controversy resulted in the voluntary creation of the British Board of Film Censors, which began operating on 1 January 1913.Conrich, Ian (October 2003). \"Film Classification and the BBFC\".

Retrieved 20 September 2012. ==Rediscovery== The film disappeared from cinema screens for a number of years until Reverend Brian Hession, vicar of Holy Trinity Church in Walton, Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, went on a quest to the US to find a copy of the film for re-issue in Britain. Although initially disappointed, he eventually discovered a set of negatives after searching in the vaults and cellars of old film concerns. Hession added a musical sound track and spoken commentary, and From the Manger to the Cross was re-released in 1938.From the Manger to the Cross (1912). BFI. Retrieved 11 February 2016. ==Critical reception== TCM host Robert Osborne and the National Film Preservation Foundation consider this film to be the most important silent film to deal with the life of Christ. In 1998, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. A history of cinemas and film-making published in 1947 had this to say: \"To-day it appears to be somewhat overacted, and the camera work is stilted, the camera being merely a recording instrument and not part of the pattern of the exposition of the story itself. Its pace is slow by modern standards, doubtless an attempt to obtain dignity, and Bland's performance is so sedately remote as to be not so much an acting performance at all but a series of dignified poses.\" ==References== ;Notes ;Sources *{{cite book |title=The Miracle of the Movies |last=Wood |first=Leslie |place=London |year=1947 |publisher=Burke Publishing Co. |url=https://archive.org/stream/miracleofmovies00lesl#page/162/mode/2up}} * Michel Derrien, Aux origines du cinéma irlandais: Sidney Olcott, le premier oeil, TIR 2013. * Philippe Baron, passion, documentaire sur From the Manger to the Cross, France, 2009, 55 minutes, produit par Vivement lundi ! ==External links== *From the Manger to the Cross essay by Daniel Eagan at National Film Registry * *From the Manger to the Cross at SilentEra * * * From the Manger to the Cross website dedicated to Sidney Olcott * Category:1912 films Category:American films Category:American silent feature films Category:American black-and-white films Category:1912 drama films Category:Films directed by Sidney Olcott Category:United States National Film Registry films Category:Kalem Company films Category:Biographical films about Jesus Category:Films set in Jerusalem Category:Films shot in Israel Category:Portrayals of the Virgin Mary in film Category:Cultural depictions of John the Baptist Category:American drama films Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Portrayals of Jesus in film Category:1910s rediscovered films Category:Portrayals of Saint Joseph in film Category:Portrayals of Mary Magdalene in film Category:Rediscovered American films",
