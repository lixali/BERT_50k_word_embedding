He discovered a total of sixty-six asteroids. Notable discoveries include 1221 Amor (which lent its name to the Amor asteroids) and the Apollo asteroid 2101 Adonis. He discovered or co-discovered some comets as well, including periodic comet 57P/du Toit- Neujmin-Delporte. He worked in the Observatoire Royal de Belgique (Belgian Royal Observatory), situated in the town of Uccle (after which the asteroid 1276 Ucclia is named). He started there in 1903 after receiving his doctorate that year from the Free University of Brussels. In 1930 he drew the modern boundaries between all of the constellations in the sky, along lines of right ascension and declination for the epoch B1875.0. The Florian asteroid 1274 Delportia (discovered by himself) and the lunar impact crater Delporte were named after him. == List of discovered minor planets == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 89%; float: left; width: 24em; margin-right: 1em; line- height: 1.6em !important; height: 625px;\" |- | 1052 Belgica || 15 November 1925 |- | 1068 Nofretete || 13 September 1926 |- | 1122 Neith || 17 September 1928 |- | 1124 Stroobantia || 6 October 1928 |- | 1128 Astrid || 10 March 1929 |- | 1145 Robelmonte || 3 February 1929 |- | 1168 Brandia || 25 August 1930 |- | 1170 Siva || 29 September 1930 |- | 1176 Lucidor || 15 November 1930 |- | 1199 Geldonia || 14 September 1931 |- | 1217 Maximiliana || 13 March 1932 |- | 1221 Amor || 12 March 1932 |- | 1222 Tina || 11 June 1932 |- | 1239 Queteleta || 4 February 1932 |- | 1261 Legia || 23 March 1933 |- | 1274 Delportia || 28 November 1932 |- | 1276 Ucclia || 24 January 1933 |- | 1280 Baillauda || 18 August 1933 |- | 1285 Julietta || 21 August 1933 |- | 1288 Santa || 26 August 1933 |- | 1290 Albertine || 21 August 1933 |- | 1291 Phryne || 15 September 1933 |- | 1293 Sonja || 26 September 1933 |- | 1294 Antwerpia || 24 October 1933 |- | 1329 Eliane || 23 March 1933 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size: 89%; float: left; width: 24em; margin-right: 1em; line-height: 1.6em !important; height: 625px;\" |- | 1341 Edmée || 27 January 1935 |- | 1350 Rosselia || 3 October 1934 |- | 1361 Leuschneria || 30 August 1935 |- | 1363 Herberta || 30 August 1935 |- | 1366 Piccolo || 29 November 1932 |- | 1374 Isora || 21 October 1935 |- | 1375 Alfreda || 22 October 1935 |- | 1388 Aphrodite || 24 September 1935 |- | 1401 Lavonne || 22 October 1935 |- | 1433 Geramtina || 30 October 1937 |- | 1476 Cox || 10 September 1936 |- | 1486 Marilyn || 23 August 1938 |- | 1491 Balduinus || 23 February 1938 |- | 1493 Sigrid || 26 August 1938 |- | 1543 Bourgeois || 21 September 1941 |- | 1560 Strattonia || 3 December 1942 |- | 1664 Felix || 4 February 1929 |- | 1672 Gezelle || 29 January 1935 |- | 1698 Christophe || 10 February 1934 |- | 1707 Chantal || 8 September 1932 |- | 1711 Sandrine || 29 January 1935 |- | 1722 Goffin || 23 February 1938 |- | 1724 Vladimir || 28 February 1932 |- | 1754 Cunningham || 29 March 1935 |- | 1848 Delvaux || 18 August 1933 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 89%; float: left; width: 24em; margin- right: 1em; line-height: 1.6em !important;\" |- | 1878 Hughes || 18 August 1933 |- | 1926 Demiddelaer || 2 May 1935 |- | 2101 Adonis || 12 February 1936 |- | 2213 Meeus || 24 September 1935 |- | 2276 Warck || 18 August 1933 |- | 2331 Parvulesco || 12 March 1936 |- | 2534 Houzeau || 2 November 1931 |- | 2545 Verbiest || 26 January 1933 |- | 2713 Luxembourg || 19 February 1938 |- | 2819 Ensor || 20 October 1933 |- | 2913 Horta || 12 October 1931 |- | 3534 Sax || 15 December 1936 |- | 3567 Alvema || 15 November 1930 |- | 3605 Davy || 28 November 1932 |- | 6354 Vangelis || 3 April 1934 |- | 7043 Godart || 2 September 1934 |} == References == Category:1882 births Category:1955 deaths Category:20th-century Belgian astronomers Category:Discoverers of asteroids Category:Discoverers of comets *",
