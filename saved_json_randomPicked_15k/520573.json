 "text": "Eltham () is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 20 km north-east of the Central Business District. Its local government area is the Shire of Nillumbik. At the 2016 Census, Eltham had a population of 18,314. Eltham is one of the 'green wedge' areas that provide relatively undeveloped, accessible environments within the Melbourne suburban region. These green wedge areas are under constant pressure from developments such as road and freeway expansions, but Eltham has managed to retain many tree-lined streets and leafy reserves. However, the character of the suburb is changing rapidly, with increased road traffic and higher-density housing becoming more common.Traffic choking Eltham because of infrastructure neglect Graeme Hammond From: Sunday Herald Sun 9 July 2010 Eltham's tourist attractions include the artists colony Montsalvat and the Diamond Valley Railway, the largest ridable miniature railway in Australia. ==History== A reserve for a village at the junction of the Diamond Creek and Yarra River is shown on maps around 1848.
