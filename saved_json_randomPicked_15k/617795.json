 "text": "A Super cup is a competition, usually but not exclusively in association football, which often forms the ’curtain-raiser’ to a season. It is typically contested on a national level by two competition winners of the previous season: the knock-out cup winner and the league winner. There are also continental super cups, like the UEFA Super Cup in football, which puts together winners of the top- and second-tier UEFA competitions. Sometimes these are two-legged ties, with a match played at each side's stadium, but increasingly they are one-off fixtures at a neutral venue, such as a national stadium. Some Super Cups have even been staged in venues outside their home country, such as the Italian, French, Spanish, Turkish, Mexican, and Egyptian games. If the league champions are also the national cup winners, they may play the runners-up from one of the competitions. ==Football== ===National super cups=== The following nations have an active super cup competition: ====AFC==== * Bahraini Super Cup * Brunei Super Cup * CNCC Charity Cup * Chinese FA Super Cup * Hong Kong Community Cup * Iranian Super Cup * Iraqi Super Cup * Japanese Super Cup * Jordan Super Cup * Kyrgyzstan Super Cup * Kuwait Super Cup * Lebanese Super Cup * Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Cup * Maldivian FA Charity Shield * Mongolia Super Cup * MFF Charity Cup * Oman Super Cup * Gaza Strip Super Cup, West Bank Super Cup * Qatari Sheikh Jassim Cup, Qatar Cup * Saudi Super Cup * Singapore Charity Shield * Syrian Super Cup * Tajik Supercup * Thailand Champions Cup * LFA Super Taça * Turkmenistan Super Cup * Uzbekistan Super Cup * UAE Super Cup * Vietnamese Super Cup * Yemeni Super Cup ====CAF==== * Algerian Super Cup * Coupe Houphouët-Boigny * Djibouti Super Cup * Egyptian Super Cup * Ghana Super Cup * Kenyan Super Cup * Libyan Super Cup * Mauritanian Super Cup * Namibia Super Cup * Super Coupe du Congo * Senegalese Super Cup * Somalia Super Cup * Tanzania Community Shield * Tunisian Super Cup ====CONCACAF==== * Supercopa de Costa Rica * Salvadoran Supercup * Copa Campeón de Campeones * Honduran Supercup * Campeón de Campeones, Supercopa MX * Suriname President's Cup * Trinidad and Tobago Charity Shield ====CONMEBOL==== * Supercopa Argentina * Supercopa do Brasil * Supercopa de Chile * Superliga Colombiana * Supercopa Ecuador * Supercopa Paraguay * Supercopa Peruana * Supercopa Uruguaya ====OFC==== * Champion versus Champion * Charity Cup * Tahiti Coupe des Champions ====UEFA==== * Albanian Supercup * Andorran Supercup * Armenian Supercup * Belarusian Super Cup * Belgian Supercup * Bulgarian Supercup * Croatian Supercup * Cypriot Super Cup * FA Community Shield (formerly the Charity Shield) * Estonian SuperCup * Faroe Islands Super Cup * Trophée des Champions * Georgian Super Cup * DFL-Supercup * Pepe Reyes Cup * Icelandic Super Cup * Israel Super Cup * Supercoppa Italiana * Kazakhstan Super Cup * Kosovar Supercup * Lithuanian Supercup * Maltese Super Cup * Moldovan Super Cup * Johan Cruyff Shield * Mesterfinalen * Polish SuperCup * Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira * President's Cup * Romanian Super Cup * Russian Super Cup * Super Coppa Sammarinese * Supercopa de España * Turkish Super Cup * Ukrainian Super Cup ====Defunct super cups==== * Trofeo de Campeones * Austrian Supercup * Azerbaijan Supercup * Bangladesh Super Cup * Supercup of Bosnia and Herzegovina * Super Coupe Roger Milla * Czech Supercup * Danish Supercup * Supercoupe du Gabon * DFV-Supercup * Greek Super Cup * Szuperkupa * Indian Super Cup * Indonesian Community Shield * Latvian Supercup * Moroccan Super Cup * NIFL Charity Shield * Top Four Cup * Macedonian Super Cup * Copa Federación * Slovak Super Cup * Slovenian Supercup * Korean Super Cup * Swiss Super Cup * Supercupen * Thai Super Cup (Top 4 places in last season, 2009 only) * Kor Royal Cup * Sheriff of London Charity Shield * Soviet Super Cup (also known as the Season's Cup) * Yugoslav Super Cup * Northern Cypriot Super Cup ===Cross-border super cups=== * Czechoslovak Supercup (cup winners) * Champions Cup (league champions) * Campeones Cup (league champions) * Saudi-Egyptian Super Cup (league champions vs. cup champions) ===Continental super cups=== Some continental football federations also have their own super cups: * 20px AFC: Asian Super Cup (defunct) * 20px CAF: CAF Super Cup * 20px CONMEBOL: Recopa Sudamericana * 20px UEFA: UEFA Super Cup ===Intercontinental super cups=== Most of the continental football confederations have jointly held a competition pitting their champions against each other: * 20px20px CONMEBOL & UEFA: Intercontinental Cup * 20px20px CONCACAF & CONMEBOL: Copa Interamericana * 20px20px AFC & CAF: Afro-Asian Club Championship All of these competitions are now defunct and have been succeeded by the FIFA Club World Cup, which features the champions of all of the confederations, plus the champion of the host country.
