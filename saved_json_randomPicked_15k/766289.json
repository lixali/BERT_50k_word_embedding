Most of the district is populated by Dzongkha speakers. However, in the southwest part near the Sarpang District, Nepali is also spoken as a native language. ==Administrative divisions== Dagana District itself is divided into fourteen village blocks (or gewogs): *Dorona Gewog *Drujegang Gewog *Gesarling Gewog *Goshi Gewog *Karmaling Gewog *Kana Gewog *Khebisa Gewog *Lajab Gewog *Lhamoy Zingkha Gewog *Nichula Gewog *Tashiding Gewog *Tsangkha Gewog *Tsendagang Gewog *Tseza Gewog ==Environment== Like most of the districts of Bhutan, Dagana contains environmentally protected areas. In southeastern Dagana that is along the border with India, lies the western half of Phibsoo Wildlife Sanctuary, covering parts of Karmaling, Lhamoy Zingkha and Nichula Gewogs. Phibsoo has no human inhabitants. It has districts that are habituated by Nepali speaking people. Daga Zong can be reached only by one single passage. ==History== On April 26, 2007, Lhamoy Zingkha Dungkhag (sub-district) was formally handed over from Sarpang Dzongkhag to Dagana Dzongkhag, having an impact on three gewogs (Lhamoy Zingkha, Deorali and Nichula (Zinchula) and the town of Lhamoy Zingkha, which formed the westernmost part of Sarpang Dzongkhag and now forms the southernmost part of Dagana Dzongkhag.http://www.pc.gov.bt/fyp/Dzongkhags/Sarpang.pdf ==See also== *Daga Province ==References== ==External links== * Official dzongkha profile with map of gewogs Category:Districts of Bhutan",
