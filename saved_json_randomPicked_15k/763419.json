 "text": "The New International Reader's Version (NIrV) is an English translation of the Christian Bible. Translated by the International Bible Society (now Biblica) following a similar philosophy as the New International Version (NIV), but written in a simpler form of English, the NIrV seeks to make the Bible more accessible for children and people who have difficulty reading English, such as non-native English speakers. The authors describe it as a special edition of the NIV written at a third grade reading level. Here is a comparison of a passage in the King James Version, the New International Version, and the New International Reader's Version: ;KJV: \"And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.\" (1 Timothy 3:16, KJV) ;NIV: \"Beyond all question, the mystery from which true godliness springs is great: He appeared in the flesh, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was preached among the nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory.\" (1 Timothy 3:16, NIV) ;NIrV: \"There is no doubt that godliness is a great mystery. Jesus appeared in a body. The Holy Spirit proved that he was the Son of God. He was seen by angels. He was preached among the nations. People in the world believed in him. He was taken up to heaven in glory.\" (1 Timothy 3:16, NIrV) Zondervan and HarperCollins published a children's version of this text, targeted at 4 to 7 year olds and featuring the characters of the Berenstain Bears .. ==See also== * New International Version ==References== ==External links== * New International Reader's Version (NIrV) Bible * New International Reader's Version Bible * New International Reader's Version Reading accessible online with concordance.
