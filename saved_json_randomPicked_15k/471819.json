 "text": "The ichthys or ichthus (), from the Greek (, 1st cent. AD Koine Greek pronunciation: , \"fish\") is a symbol consisting of two intersecting arcs, the ends of the right side extending beyond the meeting point so as to resemble the profile of a fish. The symbol was adopted by early Christians as a secret symbol. It is now known colloquially as the \"sign of the fish\" or the \"Jesus fish\". ==Origin== The first appearances of the ichthys in Christian art and literature dates to the 2nd century. The symbol's use among Christians had become popular by the late 2nd century, and its use spread widely in the 3rd and 4th centuries.Rasimus, T. (2011). \"Revisiting the Ichthys: A Suggestion Concerning the Origins of Christological Fish Symbolism\". Pp 327-348 in Mystery and Secrecy in the Nag Hammadi Collection and Other Ancient Literature: Ideas and Practices. Biblical Studies, Ancient Near East and Early Christianity E-Books Online, Collection 2012, 76. In early Christian history, the ichthys symbol held \"the most sacred significance,\" and Christians used it to recognize churches and other believers through this symbol during a time when they faced persecution in the Roman Empire. The ichthys symbol is also a reference to \"the Holy Eucharist, with which the miracle of the multiplication of the loaves and fishes had such intimate connection both in point of time and significance.\" Depicted in the Catacombs of Saint Sebastian and of the Catacomb of Priscilla, the symbol is also mentioned in the Latin text titled Oracula Sibillina which dates back to the 1st-2nd century. ==Symbolic meaning== (), or also with a lunate sigma, is an acronym or acrostic for \"Ἰησοῦς Χρῑστός Θεοῦ Υἱός Σωτήρ\", ; contemporary Koine, which translates into English as 'Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior'. * Iota (i), Iēsoûs (), \"Jesus\" * Chi (ch), Khrīstós (), \"anointed\" * Theta (th), (), \"of God\", the genitive singular of , Theós, \"God\" * Upsilon (y or u), The initial \"h\" was sometimes pronounced, depending on dialect and period, but in Ionic orthography the \"h\" sound was written with the rough breathing diacritical mark attached to the upsilon, not with a full letter (Ὺιός), and so would not be used to form a backronym. By the Early Christian period, the aspirate was probably lost in most popular varieties of Greek. (), \"Son\" * Sigma (s), (), \"Savior\" Augustine quotes an ancient text from the Sibylline oraclesSibylline oracles, Book viii, 284-330 (Greek text, 217-250) whose verses are an acrostic of the generating sentence. The statement \"Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior\" affirmed the belief of early Christians in the twofold nature of Jesus Christ being both fully human and fully divine. A fourth century adaptation of ichthys uses a round shape to represent the letters in the eight lines that bisect the shape. Most often, this shape has been interpreted as an eight-spoked wheel, but it has also been proposed that the round symbol represents a loaf of bread. ==In the Gospels== Fish are mentioned and given symbolic meaning several times in the Gospels. Several of Jesus' 12 Apostles were fishermen. He commissions them with the words \"I will make you fishers of men\". (Mark 1: 16-18) Having been resurrected, Jesus was given grilled fish in Luke 24:41-43. At the feeding of the five thousand, a boy is brought to Jesus with \"five small loaves and two fish\". The question is asked, \"But what are they, among so many?\" Jesus multiplies the loaves and fish to feed the multitude. In Matthew 13:47-50, the Parable of Drawing in the Net, Jesus compares the angels separating the righteous from the wicked at the end of this world to fishers sorting out their catch, keeping the good fish and throwing the bad fish away. In John 21:11, it is related that the disciples fished all night but caught nothing. Jesus instructed them to cast the nets on the other side of the boat, and they drew in 153 fish. When they return to shore with their catch, Jesus is waiting for them and has cooked some fish for them to eat. In Matthew 17:24-27, upon being asked if his Teacher pays the temple (or two-drachma) tax, Simon Peter answers yes. Christ tells Peter to go to the water and cast a line, saying that a coin sufficient for both of them will be found in the fish's mouth. Peter does this and finds the coin. The fish is also used by Jesus to describe \"the Sign of Jonah\". (Matthew 12:38-45) This is symbolic of Jesus's resurrection, upon which the entire Christian faith is based. (1 Corinthians 15:1-58) == In the Book of Tobit == In the Deuterocanonical Book of Tobit, by Raphael the Archangel's order, the young cousin and future spouse of Sarah captures a fish while it tries to swallow his feet, washing in the river Tigris. Then he is instructed how to offer it, in order to be saved from the daemon Asmodeus. ==Early church== According to tradition, ancient Christians, during their persecution by the Roman Empire in the first few centuries after Christ, used the fish symbol to mark meeting places and tombs, or to distinguish friends from foes: There are several other hypotheses as to why the fish was chosen. Some sources indicate that the earliest literary references came from the recommendation of Clement of Alexandria to his readers (Paedagogus, III, xi) to engrave their seals with the dove or fish. However, it can be inferred from Roman monumental sources such as the Cappella Greca and the Sacrament Chapels of the catacomb of St. Callistus that the fish symbol was known to Christians much earlier. ==In popular culture== thumb|A ΙΧΘΥΣ (″ichthys″) fish symbol on a car In the 1970s the \"Jesus Fish\" started to be used as an icon of modern Christianity. In 1973 the symbol and message was taken to the Aquarius Rock Festival in Nimbin, Australia. Today, it can be seen as a decal or emblem on the rear of automobiles or as pendants or necklaces as a sign that the owner is a Christian. Versions of this include an Ichthys with \"Jesus\" or \"ΙΧΘΥΣ\" in the centre, or simply the Ichthys outline by itself. According to one writer, while many Christians hang a cross necklace or rosary inside their vehicles, \"the fish sticker on the car is a more conscious symbol of a witnessing Christian—significantly, unlike the former, it is on the outside of the car for everyone to see.\" The Ichthus Music Festival is an annual large outdoor Christian music festival held in mid-June in Wilmore, Kentucky. It is the oldest Christian music festival in the United States, starting in 1970.See, Robison, Greg, Christian Rock Festivals, (New York: The Rosen Publishing Co., 2009), p.7 ==See also== * Awareness ribbon * Chi Rho and Labarum * Depictions of Jesus * Ichthus Christian Fellowship *Eagle catching Fish * INRI * Matsya ==References== ==External links== * Principal Christian Symbols: The Fish (Ichthus), Cross & Crucifix Extensive explanations on several popular Christian symbols, including the ichthys * Symbolism of the Fish - Catholic Encyclopedia article Category:Acronyms Category:Christian symbols Category:Early Christian inscriptions Category:Roman-era Greek inscriptions Category:Christian terminology Category:Pictograms Category:Language and mysticism Category:Early Christian art Category:Fish in religion Category:Animals in Christianity",
