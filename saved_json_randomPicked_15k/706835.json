On September 20, 2006, SNL announced that Sanz would not be returning due to budget cuts. Sanz returned to SNL as a guest on February 3, 2007, appearing as Elton John, and on November 3, as presidential candidate Bill Richardson and again on the December 17, 2011 Christmas show as himself in a musical number (\"I Wish It Was Christmas Today\") and as a member of Beethoven's orchestra (\"Beethoven: Meet The Band\"). ====Characters on SNL==== * Aaron Neville as a courtroom judge on City Court, who sang and overused cocoa butter * Gobi, the cannabis-loving co-host of Jarret's Room * Jasper Hahn, a cartoonist whose creations always start out as raunchy drawings of genitals * Rick, stepfather of Kaitlin (played by Amy Poehler) * Jeffrey's Clothing Store customer * Carol, a cheerful and crass woman * Ferey Mühtar, host of \"The Ferey Mühtar Talk Show\" * Manuel Pantalones, bandleader on \"Showbiz Grande Explosion\" * Frankie Hilbert, from the Boston Teens * Vasquez- Gomez-Vasquez * One of the Telemundo actors from \"Besos Y Lagrimas\" * Sammo Hung * Matt LeBlanc as his character Joey Tribbiani from the TV show Friends * Elton John * Billy Joel * Rosie O'Donnell * Gene Shalit ===After SNL=== Sanz was part of the cast of the short-lived ABC sitcom In the Motherhood in 2009, playing the role of Horatio the \"manny\" (male nanny). In 2010, Sanz and his former SNL castmate Chris Parnell starred together on Big Lake, a Comedy Central sitcom from executive producers Will Ferrell and Adam McKay. From 2010 to 2011, Sanz was a writer and producer on the Comedy Central sketch series Nick Swardson's Pretend Time. In 2015, he started his own podcast called The Hooray Show, which features comedy sketches and interviews with his friends in comedy. Sanz appeared as a guest on The Big Alakens, the Big Lake marathon fundraiser episode of The George Lucas Talk Show. ==Personal life== In November 2008, Sanz made his first public appearance in almost a year, after having lost . \"I've been eating better\", Sanz said. \"I've been trying to come up with a joke about how I've lost weight and I was going to say, 'I stopped putting nuts in my sundaes.'\" He also says, \"I never weighed myself when I was at my fattest, because I was scared I might die'.\" Sanz says he has been working out, too. In June 2009, he appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and said that much of his weight loss was because he had stopped drinking alcoholic beverages. He became an American citizen on July 25, 2018, in Los Angeles. ===Sexual assault allegation=== On August 12, 2021, a lawsuit was filed against Sanz, accusing him of sexual assault. The woman, remaining anonymous, claimed that Sanz would grope her and make sexual comments towards her, while she was under the age of 18. The lawsuit also states that both Saturday Night Live and NBC allowed him to participate in the acts and accuses Sanz of a direct digital assault that supposedly happened in front of other staff members. Sanz responded through his attorney by calling the allegations \"categorically false.\" ==Filmography== ===Film=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! Year ! Title ! Role !
