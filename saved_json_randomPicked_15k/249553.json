They opposed the Tokugawa shogunate (and later, supported the Meiji Emperor). These four samurai were considered elite warriors. The word hitokiri literally means \"manslayer\" or \"man cutter,\" as the kanji 人 means person, while 斬 can alternatively mean slay or cut. ==In fiction== * Hitokiri is a 1969 film directed by Hideo Gosha and starring Shintaro Katsu as Okada Izo and Yukio Mishima as Tanaka Shinbei. * The manga and anime series Rurouni Kenshin is about a former hitokiri named Himura Kenshin, who is based loosely on Kawakami Gensai. Kenshin is also known as Hitokiri Battousai (人斬り抜刀斎), or \"Sword-drawing Manslayer\". * Hideaki Sorachi's manga Gin Tama involves fictionalized versions of two of the four hitokiri (particularly Okada and Kawakami), set in an alternate version of Bakumatsu- era Japan. * The Hitokiri is a playable character in the videogame For Honor, serving as a heavy hero of the Samurai faction and fighting with a two-handed axe. == References == Category:Japanese historical terms Category:Samurai Category:Quartets",
