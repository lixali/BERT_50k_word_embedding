 "text": "Mathcounts, stylized as MATHCOUNTS, is a nationwide middle school mathematics competition held in various places in the United States. Its founding sponsors include the CNA Foundation, the National Society of Professional Engineers, and the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. The subject matter includes geometry, counting, probability, number theory, and algebra. == Competition levels == The competition is divided into four stages: school, chapter, state, and national. The problems increase in difficulty between levels, with school being the easiest and national being the hardest. The top teams and individuals from each chapter competition advance to the state competition. The exact number of qualifiers varies from region to region. At the state competition, only the top 4 individuals qualify for the national competitions, with the winning team's coach coaching the state team. At the national competition, all of the competitors compete individually in the Sprint and Target Rounds, and the four individuals from each state compete in the Team round to represent their state. == Structure == The Mathcounts program is open to sixth, seventh, and eighth-grade students in 56 U.S. states and territories. Students can participate through the Competition Program, the Club Program, and the Math Video Challenge. The standard Mathcounts competition contains four rounds: Sprint, Target, Team, and Countdown. Some competitions might provide extra, unofficial rounds. === Sprint round === In the Sprint round, contestants solve a written exam consisting of 30 problems with a time limit of 40 minutes. There are no penalties for incorrect answers. Calculators are not permitted, and contestants work individually. Questions in the Sprint round are usually the easiest problems in the written individual contests, with the problems generally increasing in difficulty as the question number increases. Sprint round questions are worth one point each. === Target round === The Target round contains eight problems, presented in four pairs of two. Students have six minutes to work on each pair of problems. Calculators are allowed during this round. The problems in the Target round are usually more difficult than most of the problems in the Sprint round. Each correctly answered problem is worth two points. The problems generally increase in difficulty as the round progresses. Contestants work individually. === Team round === The Team round is a ten question exam which teams of four have twenty minutes to complete. Calculators are allowed, and up to four teammates take the examination as a group. Contestants are allowed to discuss the problems with their teammates. Team round problems are typically more difficult than those on the individual rounds. Each question is worth two points. === Countdown round === The Countdown round is a fast-paced head-to- head competition. It is the only oral round, and it is the final round in most competitions. It is an optional round at State and Chapter competitions. At some competitions, including Nationals, the winner of the Countdown round is considered the overall champion or is used to determine qualification for later rounds. However, at most Chapter and State competitions, the round doesn't have any effect on qualification for later rounds or final standings. Calculators are not allowed in the Countdown round. The National Countdown Round was shown on ESPN from 2003 to 2005, and now it is presented in a webcast every year. == Scoring and ranking == === Individual score === Each contestant's individual score is equal to their Sprint round score plus twice their Target round score. A perfect score is 46. At the Chapter and State levels, ranking is determined by either raw individual score or by the results of the Countdown round, depending on the competition. Ties are broken by comparing performance on the Sprint round. If contestants are still tied, the last five problems of the Sprint round are compared. If contestants are still tied, pairs of Target problems are used to break ties. Occasionally, a tie- breaker round may be needed if the contestants have answered exactly the same questions correctly and incorrectly. At the National Competition, ranking on the written portion is used to determine seeding in the Countdown round. The final place is determined by performance in the Countdown round. === Team score === A team's score is equal the average of the sum of its members' individual scores plus twice the number of questions answered correctly on the team round. With the individual scores of a maximum of 46 each and team-round scores a maximum of 20, a perfect team score is 66. == History == Mathcounts was started in 1983 by the National Society of Professional Engineers, National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and CNA Foundation to increase middle school interest in mathematics. The first national-level competition in the modern format was held in 1984. Since then, a national Mathcounts competition has been held annually, but was not held in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the \"MATHCOUNTS Week\" event was held on the Art of Problem Solving website, featuring problems from the 2020 State Competition. Before 2002, every MATHCOUNTS National Competition was held in Washington, D.C. The competition spread quickly in middle schools, and today it is the best-known middle school mathematics competition. In 2021, the competition was held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. == Winners == At the state level, many universities give scholarships to the top finishers of the state. This varies by state. At the national level, scholarships and prizes are often awarded to the top ten individuals and the top three state teams. Raytheon offers scholarships to undergraduate students who volunteer as coaches for Mathcounts teams. Some math summer programs, such as MathPath, give out scholarships to top Mathcounts students. Some of Mathcounts' other sponsors, such as Texas Instruments, General Motors, and Lockheed Martin, also provide scholarships. The top team as well as the participants in the Countdown round often win a trip to the White House and meet the current President of the United States. They also may receive scholarships from Mathcounts' sponsors.
