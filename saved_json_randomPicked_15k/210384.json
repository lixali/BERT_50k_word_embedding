He became the Secretary of the Treasury on May 9, 1974, during the Nixon administration. After Nixon resigned, Simon was reappointed by President Gerald Ford and served until 1977 when President Jimmy Carter took office. Outside of government, he was a successful businessman and philanthropist. The William E. Simon Foundation carries on this legacy. He styled himself as a strong advocate of laissez-faire capitalism. He wrote, \"There is only one social system that reflects the sovereignty of the individual: the free-market, or capitalist, system\".Simon, William E. A Time for Truth (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1978), p. 221. Cited in American Chameleon, Ohio Kent State University Press, 1991, p. 203 ==Early life and career== Simon was born in Paterson, New Jersey, on November 27, 1927, the son of Eleanor (née Kearns) and Charles Simon, Jr., an insurance executive. He attended Blair Academy and graduated from Newark Academy, where he focused more on sports than scholastic pursuits.Simon, William E., American National Biography. Accessed September 14, 2018. \"Young William attended secondary school at the Blair Academy and the Newark Academy but was an undistinguished student, preferring sports to academics.\" After service in the infantry of the US Army, he received his B.A. in 1952 from Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania.

As Deputy Secretary, he supervised the Nixon administration's program to restructure and improve U.S. financial institutions. He also served as the first Administrator of the Federal Energy Office. From December 4, 1973, Simon simultaneously launched and administered the Federal Energy Administration at the height of the oil embargo.

In August 1974, only three months after Simon became Secretary of the Treasury, President Nixon resigned. Simon was asked to continue to serve at Treasury by President Gerald R. Ford, Jr., who shortly afterward appointed him chairman of the Economic Policy Board and chief spokesman for the administration on economic issues. On April 8, 1975, President Ford also named him chairman of the newly created East-West Foreign Trade Board, established under the authority of the Trade Act of 1974. In 1977, Simon received the Alexander Hamilton Award, the Treasury Department's highest honor. In 1976, while serving as Secretary of the Treasury, President Anwar Sadat of Egypt presented Simon with the Collar of the Republic/Order of the Nile. Simon's term as Secretary of the Treasury ended on January 20, 1977. As Treasury Secretary, Simon claimed to support free markets and to spurn government policies that either subsidized or penalized businesses. In Simon's own words: > Throughout the last century the attachment of businessmen to free enterprise > has weakened dramatically as they discovered they could demand – and receive > – short-range advantages from the state ... I watched with incredulity as > businessmen ran to the government in every crisis, whining for handouts or > protection from the very competition that has made this system so > productive.Bruce Bartlett, Impostor: How George W. Bush Bankrupted America > and Betrayed the Reagan Legacy, New York: Doubleday, 2006, pp. 105–06 ==Later business career== Simon attempted to purchase controlling interest in the Baltimore Orioles from Jerold Hoffberger for $12 million, but it aroused fears that he was going to move the franchise to Washington, D.C. Negotiations which began in the summer of 1978 ended when he withdrew his offer on February 5, 1979. He bitterly complained, \"Mr. Hoffberger wants to play both ends against the middle. Well, he can forget this end. I think at this point and at this time the game is over. He has damaged the merchandise and acted in bad faith. I think I've been played dirty pool everywhere to Sunday.\"Scannell, Nancy. \"Simon Withdraws Offer for Orioles,\" The Washington Post, Tuesday, February 6, 1979. Retrieved December 12, 2020 The Orioles were acquired at the same price six months later on August 2 by Edward Bennett Williams who had represented Simon in those negotiations.Scannell, Nancy. \"Hoffberger Sells Orioles To Williams,\" The Washington Post, Friday, August 3, 1979.

Simon [Sr.] came away from the experience of Watergate with a disgust > for the partisan character of the affair, and the capital. The experience of > [Nixon's] impeachment convinced him [...] not that partisanship was > necessarily poisonous, but that his opponents were far better at > partisanship than his side was. [...] Simon would spend the remainder of his > life helping to redress the balance ... Since 2001, the William E.
