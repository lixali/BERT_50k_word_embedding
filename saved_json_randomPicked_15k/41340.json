 "text": "LPD433 (low power device 433 MHz) is a UHF band in which license free communication devices are allowed to operate in some regions. The frequencies correspond with the ITU region 1 ISM band of 433.050 MHz to 434.790 MHz, and operation is limited to CEPT countries. The frequencies used are within the 70-centimeter band, which is currently reserved for government and amateur radio operations in the United States and most nations worldwide. LPD hand- held radios are authorized for licence-free voice communications use in most of Europe using analog frequency modulation (FM) as part of short range device regulations,CEPT/ERC REC 70-03 (22 August 2011) with 25 kHz channel spacing, for a total of 69 channels. In some countries, LPD devices may only be used with an integral and non-removable antenna with a maximum legal power output of 10 mW. Voice communication in the LPD band was introduced to reduce the burden on the eight (now sixteen) PMR446 channels over shorter ranges (less than 1 km). LPD is also used in vehicle key-less entry device, garage or gate openers and some outdoor home weather station products. ==Usage by country== ITU Region 1 (Europe) United Kingdom In the UK, LPD433 equipment that meets the respective Ofcom Interface Requirement can be used for model control, analogue/digitised voice and remote keyless entry systems. There is significant scope for interference however, both on frequency and on adjacent frequencies, as the band is far from free. The frequencies from 430 to 440 MHz are allocated on a secondary basis to licensed radio amateurs who are allowed to use up to 40 W (16 dBW) between 430 and 432 MHz and 400 W (26 dBW) between 432 and 440 MHz. Channels 1 to 14 are UK amateur repeater outputs and channels 62 to 69 are UK amateur repeater inputs. This band is shared on a secondary basis for both licensed and licence exempt users, with the primary user being the Ministry of Defence. Ofcom, together with the RSGB Emerging Technology Co- ordination Committee have produced guidelines to help mitigate the side effects of interference to an extent. Switzerland Switzerland permits the use of all 69 LPD433 channels with a maximum power output of 10 mW. Other European countries European remote keyless entry systems often use the 433 MHz band, although, as in all of Europe, these frequencies are within the 70-centimeter band allocated to amateur radio, and interference results. In Germany, before the end of 2008,RC-Network.de Fernsteuerfrequenzen für den Modellbau - Deutschland (Frequency bands for RC modeling - Germany) - \"Am 31.12.2008 endet die Betriebserlaubnis für Fernsteuerungen im Frequenzbereich 433 MHz!\" (As of 12/31/2008, RC use of the 433 MHz bands ends in Germany!) radio control enthusiasts were able to use frequencies from channel 03 through 67 for radio control of any form of model (air or ground-based), all with odd channel numbers (03, 05, etc. up to ch. 67), with each sanctioned frequency having 50 kHz of bandwidth separation between each adjacent channel. ITU Region 2 (America) In ITU region 2 (the Americas), the frequencies that LPD433 uses are also within the 70-centimeter band allocated to amateur radio. In the United States LPD433 radios can only be used under FCC amateur regulations by properly licensed amateur radio operators. ITU Region 3 Malaysia In Malaysia, this band are also within the 70-centimeter band (430.000 – 440.000 MHz) allocated to amateur radio. Class B amateur radio holder are permitted to transmit up to 50 watts PEP power level. There is no licence requirement for LPD as long as it complies with requirement regulated by Malaysian Communications And Multimedia Commission (MCMC). As regulated by MCMC in Technical Code for Short Range Devices, remote control and security device are allowed up to 50 mW ERP and up to 100 mW ERP for Short Range Communication (SRC) devices. RFID are allowed up to 100 mW EIRP. ==Channels== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Channel ! Frequency (MHz) ! Channel ! Frequency (MHz) ! Channel !
