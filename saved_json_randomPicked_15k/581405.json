 "text": "Thylacinus is a genus of extinct carnivorous marsupials from the order Dasyuromorphia. The only recent member was the thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus), commonly also known as the Tasmanian tiger or Tasmanian wolf, which is believed to have became extinct in 1936. In the first half of the 20th century, an already dwindling thylacine population was exposed to a combination of excessive hunting by humans, as well as likely competition with introduced dogs. Other prehistoric species are known from this genus. An unidentified species is known from Pleistocene New Guinea. Thylacines emerged around four million years ago and were known to inhabit Australia before they disappeared, most likely due to competition with dingos. Their last known stronghold was in Tasmania before they became extinct due to European hunting. ==Species== *Genus Thylacinus **Thylacinus cynocephalus, also known as the thylacine (Early Pliocene to circa 1936) **Thylacinus macknessi (Lower Miocene) **Thylacinus megiriani (Upper Miocene/Lower Pliocene) **Thylacinus potens (Upper Miocene) **Thylacinus yorkellus (Upper Miocene/Lower Pliocene) Below is a phylogeny by Yates (2015) on the relationships of Thylacinus. ==References== ==External links== *Prehistoric range of the Thylacinidae *Australian Thylacine *Various Links Category:Dasyuromorphs Category:Extinct animals of Australia Category:Extinct marsupials Category:Marsupial genera Category:Taxa named by Coenraad Jacob Temminck Category:Holocene extinctions Category:Pleistocene first appearances",
