 "text": "The Group Theatre was a theater collective based in New York City and formed in 1931 by Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford and Lee Strasberg. It was intended as a base for the kind of theatre they and their colleagues believed in-- a forceful, naturalistic and highly disciplined artistry. They were pioneers of what would become an \"American acting technique\", derived from the teachings of Konstantin Stanislavski, but pushed beyond them as well. The company included actors, directors, playwrights, and producers. The name \"Group\" came from the idea of the actors as a pure ensemble; a reference to the company as \"our group\" led them to \"accept the inevitable and call their company The Group Theatre.\"Clurman, p. 51 The New York-based Group Theatre had no connection with the identically named Group Theatre based in London and founded in 1932. In the 10 years of its existence, the Group Theatre produced works by many important American playwrights, including Clifford Odets, Sidney Kingsley, Paul Green, Robert Ardrey, and Irwin Shaw. Its most notable productions included Success Story starring Stella Adler and Luther Adler, Clifford Odets' Awake and Sing, Waiting for Lefty, Paradise Lost, and the 1937–38 Broadway hit Golden Boy, starring Luther Adler and Frances Farmer. The Group Theatre included Harold Clurman, Lee Strasberg, Cheryl Crawford, Stella Adler (a founding member), Morris Carnovsky, Clifford Odets, Sanford Meisner, Elia Kazan, Harry Morgan (billed as Harry Bratsburg), Robert Lewis, John Garfield (billed as Jules Garfield), Canada Lee, Franchot Tone, Frances Farmer, Phoebe Brand, Ruth Nelson, Will Geer, Howard Da Silva, Sidney Lumet, John Randolph, Joseph Bromberg, Michael Gordon, Paul Green, Marc Blitzstein, Paul Strand, Anna Sokolow, Lee J. Cobb, Roman Bohnen, Jay Adler, Luther Adler, Robert Ardrey, Don Richardson and many others. ==History== {{multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 170 | image1 = Men-in-White- Radio-Guide.jpg | alt1 = | caption1 = Men in White (1933), winner of the Pulitzer Prize | image2 = Luther adler stella adler 1936.JPG | alt2 = | caption2 = Luther Adler and Stella Adler in Awake and Sing!

The company asked the Theatre Guild to help cover the $5,000 cost to perform. The Theatre Guild offered to pay the full amount if the group \"removed Mary Morris and Morris Carnovsky from the cast and restored the tragic ending\" from the more upbeat and hopeful rewrite Green produced. The group refused and instead raised half on its own, receiving support from Eugene O'Neill. The play was an immediate critical success and was recognized for the special ensemble performances which the group would develop.Clurman, p. 54-55 The group's production of John Howard Lawson's Success Story, which chronicled the rise of a youthful idealist who sacrifices his principles as he rises to the top of the advertising business, received very mixed reviews, with Luther Adler and Stella Adler receiving the majority of the positive reviews.Clurman, p. 91-95 The group took on novelist Dawn Powell's dark comedy Big Night, rehearsed it for six months and asked for extensive revisions from the playwright. The result was a critical and box-office disaster that ran a scant nine performances. Harold Clurman, who took over the production late in the rehearsal period, later admitted the group's role in the fiasco. \"The play should have been done in four swift weeks — or not at all. We worried it and harried our actors with it for months.\"Clurman, p. 100-101 Later, during the first full season (1933–34), Men in White, written by Sidney Kingsley, directed by Lee Strasberg and produced by Sidney Harmon, became a financial success for the group.Clurman, p. 120-121 It won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama.Smith, Wendy. Real Life Drama: The Group Theatre and America, 1931-1940 New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1990, p. 173 On the night of January 5, 1935, some members of the group participated in a benefit performance for the New Theatre Magazine. Written by Clifford Odets and directed by Odets and Sanford Meisner, the one-act play Waiting for Lefty was performed at the Civic Repertory Theatre in New York City and became a theatrical legend.Clurman, p. 138 The play reflects a kind of street poetry that brought great acclaim to the group and to Odets as the new voice of social drama in the 1930s.Clurman, p. 141-142 Odets became the playwright most strongly identified with the group, and its productions of Awake and Sing! and Paradise Lost, both directed in 1935 by Harold Clurman, proved to be excellent vehicles for the Stanislavskian aesthetic. The following year, the group produced the Paul Green-Kurt Weill anti-war musical Johnny Johnson, directed by Strasberg.Smith, p. 275-285 thumb|260px|Some members of the Group Theatre in 1938: Roman Bohnen, Luther Adler, Leif Erickson, Frances Farmer, Ruth Nelson, Sanford Meisner, Phoebe Brand, Eleanor Lynn, Irwin Shaw, Elia Kazan, Harold Clurman and Morris Carnovsky The Group Theatre's most successful production was the 1937–38 Broadway hit Golden Boy. Elia Kazan directed Robert Ardrey's plays Casey Jones and Thunder Rock in 1938 and 1939–40 for the Group Theatre.Wesleyan Cinema Archives: The Elia Kazan Collection. Wesleyan University The group gathered at different summer locations to rehearse and train intensively for six of its 10 years in existence. The group spent the summer of 1931 at Brookfield Center, 1936 at Pine Brook Country Club, located near Nichols, Connecticut.Images of America, Trumbull Historical Society, 1997, p. 123The Cambridge Guide to American Theatre, Don Wilmeth, p. 21 Other summer venues included Brookfield Center, Connecticut (1931);Clurman, p. 36 Dover Furnace in Dutchess County, New York (1932);Smith, p. 84 Green Mansions in Warrensburg, New York in 1933;Smith, p. 139 a large house in Ellenville, New York (1934);Smith, p. 180 and Lake Grove in Smithtown, New York in 1939.Smith, p. 364 Despite its success and sweeping impact on the American theater landscape for many years to come, the group ended by 1941, and factors included the impending war, the lure of fame and fortune in Hollywood, the lack of institutional funding, and the friction of interpersonal relationships.Smith, p. 411 ==Broadway productions== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! class=\"unsortable\" | Date !

Under the leadership of Lee Strasberg, who later joined the Actors Studio and became its director in 1951, what is now referred to as The Method emerged as a lasting force in modern drama.Smith, p. 418-419 Institutionally, the Group Theatre influenced the Chelsea Theater Center, a later theater in New York (1960s and 1970s), born of idealism and destroyed by lack of funding and friction between its co-directors. Harold Prince invokes the group in his foreword to the book Chelsea on the Edge: The Adventures of an American Theater. In the 1950s, many of the former members were called before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Those who appeared as friendly witnesses, such as Elia Kazan, Clifford Odets, and Lee J. Cobb, avoided the fate of their colleagues who refused to name Communist Party members and, as a result, were blacklisted. Elia Kazan would later state he abandoned his Communist views in part because of an agenda to transform the Group Theatre into a company devoted to promoting \"Marxist ideology.\" Odets would share similar concerns after experiencing pressure from the party to change the direction of his writing. The Group Theatre is described in Robert Lewis's Slings And Arrows, Theater in My Life, Elia Kazan's A Life, and Harold Clurman's The Fervent Years. ==References== Category:Arts organizations established in 1931 Category:1931 establishments in New York City Category:Organizations disestablished in 1941 Category:1941 disestablishments in New York (state) Category:Defunct Theatre companies in New York City",
