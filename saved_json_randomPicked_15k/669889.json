 "text": "The Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly is the unicameral deliberative assembly of the General Assembly of Newfoundland and Labrador of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. It meets in the Confederation Building at St. John's. Bills passed by the assembly are given royal assent by the Queen of Canada in Right of Newfoundland and Labrador, represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Newfoundland and Labrador. The governing party sits on the left side of the speaker of the House of Assembly as opposed to the traditional right side of the speaker. This tradition dates back to the 1850s as the heaters in the Colonial Building were located on the left side. Thus, the government chose to sit near the heat, and leave the opposition sitting in the cold. ==Homes of Legislature== Before 1850 the legislature has sat at various locations including Mary Travers' tavern on Duckworth Street across from War Memorial 1832, St. John's Court House (at Duckworth and Church Hill) from 1833 to 1846, a building on southwest corner of Water Street and Prescott Street (since replaced with office building) and the site of the former St. Patrick’s Hall on Queen’s Road and Garrison Hill (demolished and replace by current building 1880). Permanent homes of the legislature, Confederation Building and Colonial Building, are the only surviving structures. == Constituencies == Members represent one electoral district each. ==Seating plan== {| style=\"text-align:center;font-size:87%;\" cellpadding=\"1px\" |- | | | bgcolor=EC6A6C | Warr | bgcolor=EC6A6C | Loveless | bgcolor=EC6A6C | Howell | bgcolor=EC6A6C | Pike | bgcolor=EC6A6C | Reid | bgcolor=EC6A6C | Gambin-Walsh | bgcolor=EC6A6C | Stoyles |- | | | bgcolor=EC6A6C | P.Parsons | bgcolor=EC6A6C | Stoodley | bgcolor=EC6A6C | A.Parsons | bgcolor=EC6A6C | Hogan | bgcolor=EC6A6C | Davis | bgcolor=EC6A6C | Bragg | bgcolor=EC6A6C | Abbott |- | | | bgcolor=EC6A6C | Osborne | bgcolor=EC6A6C | Coady | bgcolor=EC6A6C | FUREY | bgcolor=EC6A6C | Crocker | bgcolor=EC6A6C | Dempster | bgcolor=EC6A6C | Haggie | bgcolor=EC6A6C | Byrne |- | style=\"padding-top: 25px\" | |- | bgcolor=EC6A6C | Bennett |- | style=\"padding-top: 25px\" | |- | | | bgcolor=#9999ff | Pardy | bgcolor=#9999ff | Wakeham | bgcolor=#9999ff | BRAZIL | bgcolor=#9999ff | Petten | bgcolor=#9999ff | Dinn | | | bgcolor=FF7F00 | DINN | bgcolor=FF7F00 | Brown |- | | | bgcolor=#9999ff | Tibbs | bgcolor=#9999ff | O'Driscoll | bgcolor=#9999ff | Conway-Ottenheimer | bgcolor=#9999ff | Parrott | | | | | bgcolor=#FF7F00 | Evans |- | | | bgcolor=#9999ff | Wall | bgcolor=#9999ff | Forsey | bgcolor=#9999ff | Dwyer | | | | | bgcolor=#979A9A | Joyce | bgcolor=#979A9A | Lane | bgcolor=#979A9A | Trimper |} Current as of March 2022 ==Current members (MHAs)== Party leaders' names are written in bold and cabinet ministers in italic, with the Speaker of the House of Assembly designated by a dagger (†). {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! !Name !Party !Riding |- |John Abbott |Liberal |St. John's East-Quidi Vidi |Derek Bennett† |Liberal |Lewisporte-Twillingate |Derrick Bragg |Liberal |Fogo Island-Cape Freels |David Brazil |Progressive Conservative |Conception Bay East-Bell Island |Jordan Brown |New Democratic |Labrador West |Gerry Byrne |Liberal |Corner Brook |Siobhán Coady |Liberal |St. John's West |Helen Conway- Ottenheimer |Progressive Conservative |Harbour Main |Steve Crocker |Liberal |Carbonear-Trinity-Bay de Verde |Bernard Davis |Liberal |Virginia Waters- Pleasantville |Lisa Dempster |Liberal |Cartwright-L'Anse au Clair |Jim Dinn |New Democratic |St. John's Centre |Paul Dinn |Progressive Conservative |Topsail-Paradise |Jeff Dwyer |Progressive Conservative |Placentia West- Bellevue |Lela Evans |New Democratic |Torngat Mountains |Pleaman Forsey |Progressive Conservative |Exploits |Andrew Furey |Liberal |Humber-Gros Morne |Sherry Gambin-Walsh |Liberal |Placentia-St. Mary's |John Haggie |Liberal |Gander |John Hogan |Liberal |Windsor Lake |Krista Lynn Howell |Liberal |St. Barbe-L'Anse aux Meadows |Eddie Joyce |Independent |Humber-Bay of Islands |Paul Lane |Independent |Mount Pearl-Southlands |Elvis Loveless |Liberal |Fortune Bay-Cape La Hune |Loyola O'Driscoll |Progressive Conservative |Ferryland |Tom Osborne |Liberal |Waterford Valley |Craig Pardy |Progressive Conservative |Bonavista |Lloyd Parrott |Progressive Conservative |Terra Nova |Andrew Parsons |Liberal |Burgeo-La Poile |Pam Parsons |Liberal |Harbour Grace-Port de Grave |Barry Petten |Progressive Conservative |Conception Bay South |Paul Pike |Liberal |Burin-Grand Bank |Scott Reid |Liberal |St. George's-Humber |rowspan|Sarah Stoodley |Liberal |Mount Scio |Lucy Stoyles |Liberal |Mount Pearl North |Chris Tibbs |Progressive Conservative |Grand Falls-Windsor-Buchans |Perry Trimper |Independent |Lake Melville |Tony Wakeham |Progressive Conservative |Stephenville-Port au Port |Joedy Wall |Progressive Conservative |Cape St. Francis |Brian Warr |Liberal |Baie Verte-Green Bay |} ==Seat total and official layout== |- style=\"background:#ccc;\" !rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|Party !rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text- align:left;\"|Leader !colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Seats |- style=\"background:#ccc;\" | style=\"text-align:center;\"|March 25, 2021 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|Current | style=\"text-align:left;\" |Andrew Furey |22 |||22 | style=\"text-align:left;\" |David Brazil |13 ||12 | style=\"text- align:left;\" |Jim Dinn |2 ||3 | style=\"text-align:left;\" |N/A |3 |3 | style=\"text-align:left;\" |N/A |0 |0 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"3\"|Members !40!!40 |} ==See also== *50th General Assembly of Newfoundland and Labrador *48th General Assembly of Newfoundland and Labrador *47th General Assembly of Newfoundland and Labrador *Speaker of the House of Assembly of Newfoundland and Labrador *List of Newfoundland and Labrador General Assemblies ==References== ==External links== * * Canadian Governments Compared Newfoundland and Labrador * Newfoundland",
