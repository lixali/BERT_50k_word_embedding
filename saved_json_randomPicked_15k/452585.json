Siegel the third.(9 September 1977). 79 Park Avenue New Mini-Series, Dixon Evening Telegraph ==Reception== The show was a ratings success. Part I (which debuted on Sunday October 16, 1977) was the 10th most watched show in the United States for the week (22.3 rating, 16.3 million homes)(21 October 1977). World Series Big Hit, Santa Cruz Sentinel (Associated Press story) and the ratings momentum jumped for the last two installments.

ABC Tops in Television Ratings, Desert Sun (Associated Press content) The critical reviews of the series were not positive, but not overly vicious, recognizing the series for what it was and no more. Tom Shales of The Washington Post called the series a \"laughable tawdry throwback to movie eyebrow raisers of the '50s, though without any of their appealingly cheap panache. Television loves to raise the subject of sex and then avoid it like the plague.\"(15 October 1977). Imitating Life on 'Park Avenue', The Washington Post Joan Hanauer of UPI described the series as \"what is usually called a 'woman's show'\", meaning, \"the romance is unrealistically sentimental and the moral tone is high, which in no way interferes with depicting the sleaziest kind of sex.\" She found the second installment to be strongest of the three.Hanauer, Joan (15 October 1977). Unhappy Hooker at '79 Park', Galesburg Register Mail (UPI content) And although he credited the performances of the lead actors, John J. O'Connor of The New York Times was also underwhelmed by the series, calling it an \"already tired story ... manufactured for mass consumption with all of the artistic concern afforded a can of baked beans.\"O'Connor, John J. (23 October 1977). Pretenses Aside, It's Titillation As Usual, The New York Times O'Connor's year end review of 1977 television referred to 79 Park Avenue and Aspen as \"dumb pot-boilers\" which \"tarnished considerably\" the \"promising concept of mini-series.\"O'Connor, John J. (31 Decembre 1977). Picking television's best -- and worst -- of 1977, San Bernardino Sun (The New York Times news service) That the series might be somewhat controversial due to the sexual nature of the story was known from the beginning.
