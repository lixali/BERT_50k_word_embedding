The Globe and Mail, November 15, 2012. The series presented classic movies, followed by interviews and feature segments with directors, actors and other people involved in making the films presented.\"Remembering nearly 40 years of Saturday Night at the Movies: As the series' last broadcast draws near, former hosts and staff share memories\". Toronto Star, August 29, 2013. The show was initially formatted in this way due to requirements that all programming shown on TVO (including dramatic programming) needed to contain educational elements, which was usually accomplished by including interviews and analysis of the programming. Nevertheless, even after these requirements were dropped, the format was maintained; all told, the series presented almost 1,500 films and over 1,000 interviews. The show was produced for much of its run by Risa Shuman.Richard Ouzonian, \"The secret to Elwy Yost’s success\". Toronto Star, July 24, 2011. ==Broadcast history== ===Elwy Yost era=== First aired on March 30, 1974, the program was originally hosted by Elwy Yost. The first film shown was Ingmar Bergman's Through a Glass Darkly. During Yost's 25-year tenure as host, he showed a variety of foreign films, but tended to concentrate on Hollywood- produced films from the 1930s through the 1950s, slowly expanding into also showing films from the 1960s and 1970s as the series progressed. Films shown spanned all genres; Yost famously said that of all the films he had ever seen in his life, he had disliked only two.\"Elwy Yost, 1925–2011\". Torontoist, July 22, 2011. For a number of years, however, the show was unable to broadcast films from the Warner Bros. studio, as TVOntario's transmitter in Windsor created a programming rights conflict with stations in Detroit.\"TVO prepares for a revamp ; But so far no host to replace Elwy Yost\". Toronto Star, July 19, 2000. Although the hosts did interview actors and film directors, they often interviewed film crew, such as cinematographers and film editors, who much more rarely receive widespread publicity.Mark Kearney and Randy Ray, Whatever Happened To...?: Catching Up with Canadian Icons. Dundurn Press, 2006. . pp. 54-55. In his final decade hosting the show, Yost lived in Vancouver, British Columbia, and would travel to Toronto to prepare many episodes of the show at once. Yost retired as host of the series in 1999.Changing faces: Taking over Elwy Yost's host job bittersweet for Shelagh Rogers\". Waterloo Region Record, October 9, 1999. The last film he presented was, atypically, a then-recent Hollywood blockbuster: Yost chose Speed to conclude his run as host, as it was written by his son, screenwriter Graham Yost. Around the same time as his retirement, he was inducted into the Order of Canada.\"Munsch, Yost, Egoyan named to Order\". Welland Tribune, July 8, 1999. ===After Yost=== Soon after Yost's retirement, the Progressive Conservative government of Mike Harris appointed Isabel Bassett as chair of TVOntario, with a mandate to refocus the network's broadcast schedule more clearly on education.\"Isabel Bassett, the made-for-TV mover: The former culture minister is getting high marks in her tough new assignment at TVO\".

Toronto Star, November 19, 1999. Bassett instead negotiated an agreement with York University to include the series in its film studies curriculum.\"Elwy 101: TVO and York collaborate on film studies\". Guelph Mercury, February 21, 2004. Yost was replaced as host for one season by Shelagh Rogers, concurrently with her continuing role as host of CBC Stereo's classical music program Take Five. When Rogers became the host of CBC Radio's morning news program This Morning in 2000, she left Saturday Night at the Movies, which briefly changed to a hostless format.\"Saturday Night at the Movies goes hostless\". Ottawa Citizen, September 29, 2000. At this time, the series added a Sunday night companion series, Sunday Night at the Cinema, which focused more on international film. The program was then hosted by Johanna Schneller for two seasons beginning in 2004.\"Intelligence quotient\". The Globe and Mail, September 18, 2004. The show's final host, for the remainder of its run, was Thom Ernst.\"Curtain prepares to close on TV show: Saturday Night at the Movies wraps up on TVO after 39 years\".
