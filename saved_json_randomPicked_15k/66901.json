 "text": "Ehecatl (, ) is a pre-Columbian deity associated with the wind, who features in Aztec mythology and the mythologies of other cultures from the central Mexico region of Mesoamerica. He is most usually interpreted as the aspect of the Feathered Serpent deity (Quetzalcoatl in Aztec and other Nahua cultures) as a god of wind, and is therefore also known as Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl.Miller and Taube (1993, p. 84) Ehecatl also figures prominently as one of the creator gods and culture heroes in the mythical creation accounts documented for pre- Columbian central Mexican cultures.Miller and Taube (1993, pp. 70,84) Since the wind blows in all directions, Ehecatl was associated with all the cardinal directions. His temple was built as a cylinder in order to reduce the air resistance, and was sometimes portrayed with two protruding masks through which the wind blew. == Notes == == References == * * * * * * ==External links== Category:Aztec gods Category:Sky and weather gods Category:Wind deities",
