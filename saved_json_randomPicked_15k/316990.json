 "text": "The Chief Secretary to the Treasury (CST) is in practice the second most senior Treasury minister in the United Kingdom. The post nominally ranks as the third most senior ministerial office in the Treasury, after the First Lord of the Treasury and the Second Lord of the Treasury (being the Chancellor of the Exchequer). However, the post of the First Lord of the Treasury is by convention always held by the prime minister, who is only nominally within the Treasury. The office was created in 1961, to share the burden of representing the Treasury with the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The minister is shadowed by the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury who sits on the Official Opposition frontbench. ==History and responsibilities== Between 1961 and 2015, the holder of the office of Chief Secretary to the Treasury was of full cabinet rank. This formally made the HM Treasury the only department to have more than one ministerial position of cabinet rank. Since 2015, however, the status of the office has been reduced to \"also attending Cabinet\". The office holder is responsible for public expenditure, including spending reviews. ==List of chief secretaries to the Treasury== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:Center\" |+Chief Secretary to the Treasury ! style=\"text-align:center\" class=nowrap colspan=10 | |- ! colspan=2 | Portrait !
