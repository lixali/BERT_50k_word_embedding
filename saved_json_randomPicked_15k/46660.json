 "text": "The Graduate is a 1968 album of songs and music from the soundtrack of Mike Nichols' movie The Graduate. It includes five songs from the folk-rock duo Simon & Garfunkel, including \"Mrs. Robinson\", a work in progress which Simon adapted to fit the movie, along with several instrumental pieces by Dave Grusin. Released January 21 on Columbia Masterworks, the album was produced by Teo Macero. Although the album features two versions of \"Mrs. Robinson\", neither is the full version as featured on Bookends. The first is an instrumental, while the second is abbreviated, tapering off as it does in the film. However, the other major song of the album, the 1965 hit \"The Sound of Silence\", is used three times in the film. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Paul Simon – lead vocals, guitar * Art Garfunkel – lead vocals * Dave Grusin – additional music ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
