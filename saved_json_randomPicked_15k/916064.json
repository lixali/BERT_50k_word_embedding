 "text": "In additive combinatorics, the sumset (also called the Minkowski sum) of two subsets A and B of an abelian group G (written additively) is defined to be the set of all sums of an element from A with an element from B. That is, :A + B = \\\\{a+b : a \\in A, b \\in B\\\\}. The n-fold iterated sumset of A is :nA = A + \\cdots + A, where there are n summands. Many of the questions and results of additive combinatorics and additive number theory can be phrased in terms of sumsets. For example, Lagrange's four-square theorem can be written succinctly in the form :4\\Box = \\mathbb{N}, where \\Box is the set of square numbers. A subject that has received a fair amount of study is that of sets with small doubling, where the size of the set A+A is small (compared to the size of A); see for example Freiman's theorem. ==See also== *Restricted sumset *Sidon set *Sum-free set *Schnirelmann density *Shapleyâ€“Folkman lemma *X + Y sorting ==References== * * * *Terence Tao and Van Vu, Additive Combinatorics, Cambridge University Press 2006.",
