 "text": "Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. In contrast to real numbers that have the property of varying \"smoothly\", the objects studied in discrete mathematics – such as integers, graphs, and statements in logicRichard Johnsonbaugh, Discrete Mathematics, Prentice Hall, 2008; James Franklin, Discrete and continuous: a fundamental dichotomy in mathematics, Journal of Humanistic Mathematics 7 (2017), 355-378.. – do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values. Discrete mathematics therefore excludes topics in \"continuous mathematics\" such as calculus and analysis. Included below are many of the standard terms used routinely in university-level courses and in research papers. This is not, however, intended as a complete list of mathematical terms; just a selection of typical terms of art that may be encountered. ==Subjects in discrete mathematics== * Logic - a study of reasoning * Set theory - a study of collections of elements * Number theory - * Combinatorics - a study of Counting * Finite mathematics - a course title * Graph theory - a study of graphs * Digital geometry and digital topology * Algorithmics - a study of methods of calculation * Information theory - * Computability and complexity theories - dealing with theoretical and practical limitations of algorithms * Elementary probability theory and Markov chains * Linear algebra - a study of related linear equations * Functions - * Partially ordered set - * Probability - * Proofs - * Relation - ==Discrete mathematical disciplines== For further reading in discrete mathematics, beyond a basic level, see these pages.
