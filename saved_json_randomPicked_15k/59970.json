At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Piso and Laenas (or, less frequently, year 615 Ab urbe condita) and the Second Year of Jianyuan. The denomination 139 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. == Events == === By place === ==== China ==== * Emperor Wu of Han sends the diplomat Zhang Qian west to form an alliance with the Yuezhi against the Xiongnu.
