 "text": "Bantik is an endangered Austronesian language, perhaps a Philippine language, of North Sulawesi, Indonesia. It is the traditional language of the Bantik people, who are now switching to Manado Malay (the local variety of Malay) as their language for everyday communication, though Bantik is still used as a marker of ethnic identity. Bantik is regarded as a men's language, used by men in private, and it is considered improper to speak to women in Bantik. Very few women under the age of 30 know how to speak it. ==Phonology== ===Vowels=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |+Bantik vowels ! ! Front ! Back |- ! High | | |- !
