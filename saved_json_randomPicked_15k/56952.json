The county is named after the Irish province of Ulster. ==History== thumb|left|Ulster County in 1875 ===Founding and formation=== When part of the New Netherland colony, Dutch traders first called the area of present-day Ulster County \"Esopus\", a name borrowed for convenience from a locality on the opposite side of the Hudson. The local Lenape indigenous people called themselves Waranawanka, but soon came to be known to the Dutch as the \"Esopus Indians\" because they were encountered around the settlement known as Esopus. In 1652, Thomas Chambers, a freeholder from the Manor of Rensselaerswyck, purchased land at Esopus. He and several others actually settled and began farming by June, 1653. The settlements grew into the village of Wiltwijck, which the English later named Kingston. In 1683, the Duke of York created 12 counties in his province, one of which was Ulster County, named for Ulster, the northern part of Ireland, which had only recently been brought under English rule following a series of wars and rebellions, and then the Plantation of Ulster. Its boundaries at that time included the present Sullivan County and parts of the present Delaware, Orange, and Greene Counties. In 1777, the first state capital of the independent New York State was established at Kingston. The official records of Ulster County were removed to safety to a stone house in Kerhonkson when it became evident that the British would burn Kingston. In 1797, parts of Otsego and Ulster Counties were split off to create Delaware County. In 1798, Ulster County's southernmost towns were moved into Orange County to compensate Orange for breaking away its southernmost part to form Rockland County. In 1800, portions of Albany and Ulster Counties were split off to create Greene County. In 1809, Sullivan County was split off from Ulster County. ===Civil War=== During the American Civil War, volunteers were recruited from the county and formed the majority of the following regiments: *80th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment *120th New York Volunteer Infantry *156th New York Volunteer Infantry Other regiments with at least one company from the county included: *1st Battalion New York Volunteer Sharpshooters *1st New York Volunteer Engineer Regiment *7th Regiment New York Volunteer Cavalry *7th New York Veteran Infantry Regiment *15th Regiment New York Volunteer Cavalry *20th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment *25th Regiment New York Volunteer Cavalry *25th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment *56th New York Volunteer Infantry *65th New York Volunteer Infantry *71st New York Infantry *102nd New York Volunteer Infantry *132nd New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment *168th New York Volunteer Infantry *176th New York Volunteer Infantry *178th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment *192nd New York Volunteer Infantry ===Twentieth century=== The Lake Mohonk Mountain House on Shawangunk Ridge was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986. ==Geography== thumb|right|300px|Lake Minnewaska According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has an area of , of which is land and (3.1%) is water.

In 2004, John Kerry defeated George W. Bush by 54–43%; in 2008, Barack Obama defeated John McCain by 61–38%; in 2012, Obama defeated Mitt Romney by 60–37%; and in 2016, Hillary Clinton defeated Donald Trump by 52-41%. The county is in New York's 19th congressional district, represented by Democrat Antonio Delgado. Ulster long had a county-scale version of a council-manager government, with the county legislature hiring a county administrator to handle executive functions. The chair of the legislature had a great deal of power and was accountable only to the voters of his own district. The only countywide elected officials were the county clerk (Nina Postupack has served since 2006), district attorney (Dave Clegg took office in 2020) and sheriff (Juan Figueroa took office in 2019). In 2006, voters approved the first-ever county charter, changing to an elected executive branch. Two years later, Michael P. Hein, the last appointed county administrator, became Ulster's first elected county executive. In early 2019, Hein resigned to accept Governor Andrew Cuomo's appointment as commissioner of the state Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance. Deputy County Executive Adele Reiter succeeded him as acting county executive until a special election was held in April 2019. On April 30, 2019, Democrat Patrick K. Ryan was elected in a special election by a margin of 74%-26%. He was sworn in as Ulster County's second County Executive on June 7, 2019. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |+Ulster County Executives !
