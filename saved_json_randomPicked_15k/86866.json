He is also associated with a local hunting deity with a piglet under his arm, and sometimes associated with nuts, acorns, and pine cones. The central area where Vosegus was worshiped was around the Donon. On top of a hill there was a temple dedicated to Vosegus.Vosegus - A Gaulish god: The Sower The name is derived from the Proto-Celtic *uɸo- (“sub-, under”) and *segos (“force, victory”). Later in Gallo-Roman religion, Vosegus was the patron god of the Vosges in eastern Gaul.
