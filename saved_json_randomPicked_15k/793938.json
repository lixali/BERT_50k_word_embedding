 "text": "Friday the Rabbi Slept Late is a mystery novel written by Harry Kemelman in 1964, the first of the successful Rabbi Small series. == Plot introduction == The fictional hero of the book, David Small, is the unconventional leader of the Conservative Jewish congregation in the fictional suburban Massachusetts town of Barnard's Crossing. As the protagonist of a series of novels, Rabbi Small has wisdom, an unerring sense of Jewish tradition (which can at times put him at odds with the Jewish community when he believes that they are seriously deviating from Judaism) and all the good qualities of a detective sharpened by his Talmudic training, which enables him to see the third side of a problem. He is a devoted husband to his wife and (later in the series) father to his two children Jonathan and Hepsibah. Small's logic, learned from the Talmud, plays an important part in the plots. Usually Small is drawn into the events when they involve a member of his congregation or Barnard's Crossing's Jewish community in general. Small has many troubles with his congregation and he is constantly at odds with at least one of its powerful members, usually the Temple President at the time. Hugh Lanigan is the local police chief. Lanigan (a Catholic) and Small become friendly, and they often discuss religion over a cup of tea. ==Plot summary== The body of a young woman is found on the grounds of the Temple. The woman had been strangled and evidence points to Rabbi Small - her purse is found in his car, which had been left in the Temple parking lot the night before. ==Characters== *David Small - the newly hired rabbi of the title; protagonist *Hugh Lanigan - the local police chief *Miriam Small - the Rabbi's wife *Jacob Wasserman - the President of the Temple *Al Becker - local car dealer, unfriendly towards Rabbi Small *Elspeth Bleech - the murder victim, whose body is found on the Temple grounds *Stanley Doble - the Temple custodian and handyman ==Series== Between 1966 and 1996, Kemelman wrote a total of 11 sequels to Friday the Rabbi Slept Late.
