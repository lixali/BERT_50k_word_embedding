 "text": "Nyssaceae is a family of flowering trees sometimes included in the dogwood family (Cornaceae). Nyssaceae is composed of 37 known species in the following five genera:Averyanov, L. V. & Hiep, N. T. (2002). Diplopanax vietnamensis, a New Species of Nyssaceae from Vietnam – One More Living Representative of the Tertiary Flora of Eurasia. Novon 12: 433–436. Available online (pdf) *Camptotheca, the happy trees: two species in China *Davidia, the dove tree, handkerchief tree, or ghost tree: one species in central China *Diplopanax: two species in southern China and Vietnam *Mastixia: about nineteen species in Southeast Asia *Nyssa, the tupelos: about 7–10 species in eastern North America and East to Southeast Asia Among the extinct genera of the family are Mastixicarpum, very similar to Diplopanax, and Tsukada, an extinct relative of Davidia. In some treatments, Davidia is split off into its own family, the Davidiaceae. Diplopanax and Mastixia are also sometimes separated into the family Mastixiaceae.Fan, C. Z., and Xiang, Q. Y. (2003). Phylogenetic analyses of Cornales based on 26S rRNA and combined 26S rDNA-matK-rbcL sequence data. American Journal of Botany 90, 1357–1372. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group APG III system included the genera of Nyssaceae within Cornaceae. The APG IV system recognizes Nyssaceae as a distinct family ==References== Category:Asterid families",
