It was created on 19 April 1802 for the lawyer, judge and politician Sir Edward Law, Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench from 1802 to 1818. His son, the second Baron, notably served as Governor-General of India. On 22 October 1844 the second Baron was created Viscount Southam, of Southam in the County of Gloucester, and Earl of Ellenborough, in the County of Cumberland. These titles were also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. His only son predeceased him and on his death in 1871 the viscountcy and earldom became extinct. However, he was succeeded in the barony by his nephew, the third Baron. He was the son of the Hon. Charles Law, Member of Parliament for Cambridge University, second son of the first Baron. In 1885 he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Towry (which was that of his father's mother). On the death of his son, the fourth Baron, this line of the family failed. He was succeeded by his cousin, the fifth Baron. When he died the title passed to his younger brother, the sixth Baron. the title is held by the latter's great-grandson, the ninth Baron, who succeeded his father in 2013. ==Baron Ellenborough (1802)== *Edward Law, 1st Baron Ellenborough (1750–1818) *Edward Law, 2nd Baron Ellenborough (1790–1871) (created Earl of Ellenborough in 1844) ===Earl of Ellenborough (1844)=== *Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough (1790–1871) ===Baron Ellenborough (1802; reverted)=== *Charles Edmund Towry-Law, 3rd Baron Ellenborough (1820–1890) *Charles Towry Hamilton Towry-Law, 4th Baron Ellenborough (1856–1902) *Edward Downes Law, 5th Baron Ellenborough (1841–1915) *Cecil Henry Law, 6th Baron Ellenborough (1849–1931) *Henry Astell Law, 7th Baron Ellenborough (1889–1945) *Richard Edward Cecil Law, 8th Baron Ellenborough (1926–2013) *Rupert Edward Henry Law, 9th Baron Ellenborough (b. 1955) The heir apparent is the present holder's son, the Hon.
