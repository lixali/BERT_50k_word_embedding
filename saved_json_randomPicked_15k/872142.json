 "text": "A blues shouter is a blues singer, often male, capable of singing unamplified with a band. Notable blues shouters include: *Walter Brown, of the Jay McShann orchestra. *H-Bomb Ferguson *Wynonie Harris *Duke Henderson, who operated mainly in the late 1940s and early 1950s. *Jimmy Rushing, blues shouter with Count Basie. *Big Joe Turner â€“ his style hardly changed at all between 1938's \"Roll 'Em Pete\", and 1954's \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\". AllMusic called Turner \"the premier blues shouter of the postwar era\". *Eddie \"Cleanhead\" Vinson, an unusual combination of blues shouter and bebop alto saxophone player. *Big Joe Williams *Jimmy Witherspoon, who also appeared with Jay McShann. *Billy Wright *Howlin' Wolf (Chester Burnett) ==References== Category:Blues * Category:Extended techniques",
