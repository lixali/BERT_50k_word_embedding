 "text": "The first three leaders of the Liberal Party of Canada were not chosen at a leadership convention. Alexander Mackenzie (March 1873 - April 1880) and Edward Blake (May 1880 - June 1887) were chosen by the party caucus. Wilfrid Laurier (June 1887 - February 1919) was also chosen by caucus members with the party convention of 1893 ratifying his leadership. The most recent leadership election was held in 2013. The first Liberal leadership convention was held on August 7, 1919. Balloting continued until one candidate won a majority of votes. After the 1919 convention, a system was adopted where the candidate with the fewest votes on a given ballot is automatically dropped. More recently, any candidate with less than 5% of the vote on the first ballot is also automatically dropped. Since 1919, time has also been given between ballots for candidates to announce if they wish to withdraw and throw their support to another candidate. The 2009 Liberal leadership election was the last one in which the leader was chosen by delegates. Future leadership elections were to be conducted according to a weighted one member, one vote system in which all party members could cast ballots but in which they would be counted so that each riding had equal weight. This system, however, has been modified in the 2012 Biennial Convention in Ottawa. In addition to the card-carrying membership, registered supporters, a newly created category of Liberal sympathisers, given the right to vote in their constituency. ==1919 leadership convention results== The 1919 leadership convention was held in Ottawa, Ontario on August 7, 1919. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Delegate support by ballot |- ! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" | Candidate ! colspan=\"2\" | 1st ballot ! colspan=\"2\" | 2nd ballot ! colspan=\"2\" | 5th ballot |- !
