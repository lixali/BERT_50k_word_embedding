 "text": "thumb|right|Examples of acroteria An acroterion, acroterium, or akroteria is an architectural ornament placed on a flat pedestal called the acroter or plinth, and mounted at the apex or corner of the pediment of a building in the classical style. An acroterion placed at the outer angles of the pediment is an acroterion angularium ( means ‘at the corners’). The acroterion may take a wide variety of forms, such as a statue, tripod, disc, urn, palmette or some other sculpted feature. Acroteria are also found in Gothic architecture. They are sometimes incorporated into furniture designs. ==Etymology== The word comes from the Greek ( 'summit, extremity'), from the comparative form of the adjective (, 'extreme, endmost'). It was Latinized by the Romans as . Acroteria is the plural of both the original Greek and the Latin form. According to Webb, during the Hellenistic period the winged victory or Nike figure was considered to be \"the most appropriate motif for figured akroteria.” Image:Marble akroterion MET DT259543.jpg|Greek akroterion, 350–325 BC, marble, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York City) File:Marble akroterion of the grave monument of Timotheos and Nikon MET GR97.jpg|Akroterion of the grave monument of Timotheos and Nikon, 350–325 BC, marble, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art File:Monument Gordon 06.JPG|Acroterion on the Gordon Monument in Waterloo ==See also== * Antefix * Finial * List of classical architecture terms ==References== ==External links== * Category:Ornaments (architecture) Category:Ancient Greek architecture Category:Roofs Category:Ancient Roman architectural elements",
