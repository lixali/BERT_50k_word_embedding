Exact age limits are slightly different in each organization. ==History== Brownies, originally called Rosebuds, were first organized by Lord Baden-Powell in 1914, to complete the range of age groups for girls in Scouting. They were first run as the youngest group in the Guide Association by Agnes Baden-Powell, Lord Baden-Powell's younger sister. In 1918 his wife, Lady Olave Baden-Powell, took over the responsibility for the Girl Guides and thus for Brownies. Originally the girls were called Rosebuds, but were renamed by Lord Baden-Powell after the girls had complained that they did not like their name. Their name comes from the story \"The Brownies\" by Juliana Horatia Ewing, written in 1870. In the story two children, Tommy and Betty, learn that children can be helpful brownies instead of being lazy boggarts. ===Italian history=== In Italy, the term was maintained and also extended to boys, coexisting with Wolf Cubs. ===United Kingdom=== In the United Kingdom, Brownies were originally called Rosebuds. Rosebuds was started in 1914 and was originally for girls aged 8–11. Rosebuds was renamed to Brownies in 1915. In 1937 Princess Margaret became the first royal Brownie. Brownies is the second youngest section of Girlguiding in the UK; for girls aged 7–10. A group of Brownies who meet together is called a unit.Girlguiding, Adult to child ratios, accessed 21 October 2021 Brownies work in small groups called sixes: each six is named after either fairies or woodland creatures. A six is led by a Sixer and has a Second who acts as deputy. The Brownie programme is called the Brownie Adventure. It is split into 3 parts: you, community, world. Brownies work towards interest badges, there are 57. These can be done in meetings with the unit or at home or in clubs such as swimming. Brownies can also work towards their Adventure badges. These are gained over a period of time and require girls to complete many different activities, such as going on an adventure, taking part in an activity with another unit and earning an interest badge. There are a few Brownie songs that some packs sing at the beginning of the meeting: :Come let us make a Brownie ring, a Brownie Ring a Brownie Ring :Come let us make a Brownie Ring, we hear our Brown Owl Calling. :Under the Brownie bridge we go, bridge we go, bridge we go :Under the Brownie bridge we go, because we are the..... (name of six is entered) This is usually sung as each six skips under the brownie bridge and into the circle. It is often followed by the next song: :We're Brownie Guides, we're Brownie Guides :We're here to lend a hand :To love our God and serve our Queen :And to help our homes and land :We're Brownie friends, we're Brownie friends :In North, South, East and West :We're joined together in our wish :To try to do our best There are slight variations of the songs. Some packs also sing one of the traditional songs to end a meeting, to the tune of the Cambridge Chimes: :O Lord, our God :Thy children call :Grant us Thy peace :And bless us all :O Lord, this week :Thy children seek :Good deeds to do :And to be true :Good-night (everyone then salutes each other) ==Motto, Promise and Law== ===Australia=== In Australia (where girls of all ages are now called Girl Guides) the Guiding Promise is: :I promise that I will do my best, :To be true to myself and develop my beliefs, :To serve my community and Australia, :and live by the Guide law.
