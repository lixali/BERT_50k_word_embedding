 "text": "This list of comics publishing companies lists companies, specifically publishing companies who primarily publish comics. Comic art is an art medium used to present ideas or stories via images. The images are usually arranged in panels in a sequence that conveys the story. Sounds are expressed using speech balloons and onomatopoeia. European comics have existed since 1837, when Swiss artist Rodolphe TÃ¶pffer published Histoire de M. Vieux Bois. The oldest comic publishing company on this list is the now-defunct book publishing company, David McKay Publications that was founded in 1882 and published comics from 1935 to 1950. Most comic publishing companies were established in the United States of America where comics became popular in the mid-1900s. ==Publishers== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ Comics publishing companies |- ! style=\"background:#cfcfcf;\" align=\"center\" | Name ! align=\"center\" | Country ! colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | Active ! class=\"unsortable\" align=\"center\" | Notes |- |} ==See also== * List of Golden Age comics publishers * List of manga publishers Ghettostone Publications Company is an african American-owned comic book publishing company located in Kansas City Missouri.
