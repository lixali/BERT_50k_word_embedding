 "text": "Lusophone music, is music that is sung in Portuguese. Generally this term is not used outside of the internet, because of cultural differences between the peoples of the different Portuguese-speaking countries. The term refers to a language-based grouping and not based on musical characteristics since the music of Portuguese-speaking countries is most diverse. Excluding Portugal and Brazil, in the Portuguese-speaking countries some music may be sung in Portuguese (for example, in Angola) but in these latter countries the music is overwhelmingly performed in languages other than Portuguese.
