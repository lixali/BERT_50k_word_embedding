Along with her equally larcenous father, \"Colonel\" Harrington, and his partner Gerald, she is out to fleece rich, naive Charles Pike, the heir to the Pike Ale (\"The Ale That Won for Yale\") fortune, on an ocean liner. Charles is a woman-shy snake expert just returning from a year- long expedition up the Amazon. The young women aboard the ship compete for his attention, but Charles is more concerned with reading about snakes. Jean contrives a way to meet Charles, who is smitten with her. After Jean runs off, terrified by a real snake that Charles has brought on board, the two share a steamy scene in her cabin. Charles's minder Muggsy suspects that Jean is a trickster looking to steal from Charles, but Charles refuses to believe him. However, despite the con, Jean falls in love with Charles and shields him from her card sharp father. Muggsy discovers the truth and presents proof to Charlie, who dumps Jean. Furious at being scorned, Jean soon re-enters Charles's life masquerading as the posh Lady Eve Sidwich, niece of Sir Alfred McGlennan Keith, another con man who has been swindling the rich of Connecticut. Jean takes on an English accent, determined to torment Charles mercilessly, as she explains, \"I've got some unfinished business with him—I need him like the axe needs the turkey.\" When Charles meets Jean as Lady Eve, he is so bewildered at her resemblance to the Jean that he knew that he constantly trips and falls over himself. Although Muggsy tries to convince him that \"she's the same dame,\" Charles reasons that Jean would not come close to his home without at least disguising herself. Then, after Sir Keith feeds him a story that the Lady Eve is Jean's sister, Charles accepts the resemblance. After a brief courtship they marry, right on Jean's schedule. And just as she had planned, on the train to their honeymoon Eve begins to confess her past, continuously dropping names of many old boyfriends and lovers. A disgusted Charles jumps off the train. Jean's con team urges her to close the deal by pursuing a huge divorce settlement, but she tells Charles' father on the phone that she wants no money, but only wants Charles to tell her that their marriage is over in person. Charles refuses. Jean is then told by Charles' father that Charles is departing on another ocean voyage. She arranges passage for herself and her father, and then schemes to happen upon Charles, just as they had met before. Charles is overjoyed to see the real Jean again, and they dash to her cabin, where they mutually affirm their love for each other. Charles confesses that he is married, and Jean replies, \"So am I, darling.\" ==Cast== ==Production== right|thumb|Henry Fonda from a trailer for The Lady Eve The Lady Eve was loosely based on a 19-page story by Monckton Hoffe called \"Two Bad Hats,\" which was also the working title for the film. Sturges was assigned to write a script based on Hoffe's story in 1938, with Claudette Colbert expected to be the star. Sturges and Paramount producer Albert Lewin had some written disagreement in 1939 about the development of the script. Lewin wrote to Sturges, \"[T]he first two-thirds of the script, in spite of the high quality of your jokes, will require an almost one hundred percent rewrite.\" Sturges objected, and eventually Lewin acceded, writing, \"Follow your witty nose, my boy; it will lead you and me and Paramount to the Elysian pastures of popular entertainment.\"Miller, Frank and Jeff Stafford. \"Articles: The Lady Eve.\" Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved: June 10, 2013. The Hays Office initially rejected the script because of \"the definite suggestion of a sex affair between your two leads\" that lacked \"compensating moral values,\" and a revised script was submitted and approved. At some point, the studio wanted Brian Aherne for the male lead, and Joel McCrea, Madeleine Carroll and Paulette Goddard were under consideration as of July 1940, but in August 1940, Fred MacMurray and Madeleine Carroll were announced as the film's co-stars. In September, Darryl Zanuck lent Henry Fonda to co-star with Goddard, who was then replaced by Barbara Stanwyck. Production took place from October 21 to December 5, 1940.\"The Lady Eve Overview.\" TCM. Retrieved: November 17, 2011. According to Donald Spoto in Madcap: The Life of Preston Sturges, Sturges \"... invariably paraded on [the] set with a colorful beret or a felt cap with a feather protruding, a white cashmere scarf blowing gaily round his neck and a print shirt in loud hues ... the reason for the peculiar outfits, he told visitors, was that they facilitated crew members finding him amid the crowds of actors, technicians, and the public.\" Stanwyck compared Sturges's set to \"a carnival.\" In his biography of Stanwyck, author Axel Madsen wrote: \"The set was so ebullient that instead of going to their trailers between setups, the players relaxed in canvas chairs with their sparkling director, listening to his fascinating stories or going over their lines with him. To get into mood for Barbara's bedroom scene, Sturges wore a bathrobe.\" Location shooting for the opening jungle scene took place at Lake Baldwin of the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden in Arcadia, California.\"The Lady Eve Filming Locations.\" IMDb.

As a matter of fact, it is all too rare indeed that we have even moderate provocation to mark a wonder of the cinematic world. Too many of the films on which we comment boil down to woeful mediocrity, and too many of the people who make them betray a depressing weariness.\"Crowther, Bosley. \"Creative Man; Preston Sturges claims his niche as a comedy master with 'Lady Eve'.\" The New York Times, March 2, 1941. More than 50 years later, Roger Ebert gave the film high praise: \"If I were asked to name the single scene in all of romantic comedy that was sexiest and funniest at the same time, I would advise beginning at six seconds past the 20-minute mark in Preston Sturges's The Lady Eve.\"Ebert, Roger. \"The Lady Eve (1941)\". The Chicago Sun Times, November 23, 1997. Retrieved: November 17, 2011. Some have identified a theme of gender inversion, with Jean Harrington clearly in control for the majority of the film until her feelings get in the way of her original intentions. Until she realizes that she loves Charles, there is little sense of the struggle between equals that typifies most romantic comedies. The film has been lauded for a unique blend of slapstick and satire.Coursodon 1983, p. 322. Film scholars have observed the theme of the fall of man implied by the film's title; in the literal sense, the fall is evidenced in Pike's frequent pratfalls, and figuratively, he falls from innocence as he is lured into Jean's deceptive plots.Faith 1995, p. 162. Film critic Andrew Sarris identifies the theme of deceptiveness throughout the film, with things as small as the distinction, or lack thereof, between beer and ale, as well as the various disguises of Jean Harrington, adding depth to the plot line. Most of the characters have two names (Charles is Hopsie, Jean is Eve Sidwich); this lack of recognition sets the stage for the storyline. Sturges repeatedly suggests that the \"lowliest boob could rise to the top with the right degree of luck, bluff and fraud.\"Sarris 1995, p. 113. ==Awards and honors== At the 14th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for Best Original Story for Monckton Hoffe but Here Comes Mr. Jordan (Harry Segall) proved victorious.
