 "text": "Bhaktapur (, ; \"City of Devotees\"), known locally as Khwopa (Nepal Bhasa: , ), is a city in the east corner of the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal located about from the capital city, Kathmandu. It is located in and serves as the headquarters of Bhaktapur District in Bagmati Province of Nepal. In terms of area, Bhaktapur is the smallest city of Nepal. Founded in the 12th century by King Ananda Deva, Bhaktapur served as the capital of Nepal during the first half of Malla Dynasty until the Kingdom split into three in the 15th century. Bhaktapur was a powerful and wealthy independent Newar kingdom under the Malla kings who ruled Bhaktapur from the 15th century to late 18th century before it was annexed into the Gorkha Kingdom. The Malla era was a golden one for Bhaktapur as it was during their reign that art and architecture flourished in Bhaktapur. After its annexation, Bhaktapur lost most of its importance with a halt in development of arts and Bhaktapur remained isolated form the now capital city of Kathmandu and Patan allowing it to remain a homogeneous Newar city. Bhaktapur speaks a distinct dialect of Nepal Bhasa. Bhaktapur is one of the most visited tourist destination of Nepal. As such it is an important tourist destination in Nepal with the medieval city attracting 301,012 tourists in 2014. Bhaktapur is also notable for its pottery and handicraft industries, and for its rich culture. Due to its well preserved medieval nature, UNESCO inscribed Bhaktapur as a World Heritage Site since 1979. Bhaktapur is also referred as the \"Rome of Nepal\". == Etymology == The present name of the city, \"Bhaktapur\" seems to be the Sanskrit translation of the term \"Khopring\". Similarly, the current indigenous Nepal Bhasa name for the city, Khwopa and the Tamang name for the city, Khwowāng are also derived from the term \"Khopring\". In various Licchavi inscriptions, Bhaktapur is referred as \"Khopring grāma pradésha\"(Devanagari: ख्वप्रिङग्रामप्रदेश), where grama and pradesha are Sanskrit terms used to refer to a settlement. The term Khopring however is of Sino-Tibetan (proto Newari or Kiranti) origin. In a manuscript from 928 AD, the term Bhaktapur was used for the first time to refer to the city, likely a Sanskrit translation of Khopring. Based on the Sanskrit translation, historians and lingusits have proposed that the term Khopring is made up of two Kiranti terms, Kho meaning cooked rice and pring meaning a village. Hence, the term was translated into Sanskrit as Bhaktagrāma or Bhaktapura, where Bhakta means cooked rice while grāma and pura are Sanskrit words meaning village and town respectively. Similarly, the current indigenous Nepal Bhasa name of the city, Khwopa is the corrupted form of the term Khopring. The Tamang name for the city, Khwowāng is similarly derived form Khopring. The first corrupted form of Khopring appeared in a manuscript from Nepal Sambat 125 (=1004 AD) where the city is referred as Khwopu. Similarly, the Gopal Raj Vamshavali written in the 14th century refers to the city as Khwopa, Khwopu and Swopa. The name Khwopa or its derivatives have been frequently used to describe the city in various inscriptions, manuscripts and documents since the Early Malla peroid. After the conquest of Bhaktapur by the Gorkhali armies of Prithivi Narayan Shah, Bhaktapur was started to be referred as Bhatgaon, the Khas translation of Bhaktagrama. The name Bhatgaon became quite popular and was used to refer to Bhaktapur since its annexation to until about recently. However, after seeing numerous temples, religious heritages and the devotion shown by the locals towards it, Prime Minister Juddha Shumsher Rana decreed that the city should be referred as \"Bhaktapur\", as in \"City of Devotees\" instead of Bhatgaon. ==History == === Early history === The history of Bhaktapur is entwined with the history of Kathmandu Valley itself and as such its early history is filled with mythology. As per a folklore, the entire Kathmandu Valley was once a lake which was drained by the Bodhisattva Manjushri making human habitation in the valley possible. The Kiranti people are among the first people group to inhabit the fertile valley. The eastern part of the valley was particularly popular for the production of rice and was called as Khopring (meaning \"rice village\") by the locals. ===Licchavi era=== ====Early Licchavi==== A stone inscription from the 594 AD from Bhaktapur made during the reign of Amshuverma mention Bhaktapur as \"Mākhopring dranga\". Dranga(Sanskrit: द्रङ्ग) is a Sanskrit word used in Licchavi inscriptions to refer to a well developed trading centre suggesting it was a developed settlement. Various other inscriptions form the 5th and 6th century has been found where Bhaktapur is referred as \"Khopring grāma\" or \"Khopring grāma pradésha\". ==== 7th–11th century ==== Naréndra Deva was the king of Bhaktapur from 640 to 683 AD. Various stone inscriptions from his period have been found in Bhaktapur. According to various chronicles, Kathmandu Valley suffered from a great drought during his reign. Naréndra Deva performed various religious rites to please various deities with the hopes of ending the drought but they didn't work. One of Naréndra Deva's Vajracharya priest told him that the cause of the drought was Gorakhnath who had trapped the rain causing serpents. Naréndra Deva was told that the only way to convince Gorakhnath to release the serpents was to bring his teacher Lokésvara from Kamarupa (present day Assam). So in order to do it, Naréndra Deva along with a Tantric priest from Kathmandu and a farmer from Lalitpur made their journey to Kamarupa and brought Lokésvara in Nepal bringing the drought to an end. Naréndra Deva was a big follower of Buddhism and later he left his throne to become a monk. He lived as a monk in a Buddhist Bāhāl named Akha Bahī of Bhaktapur. A stone inscription written in Nepal Sambat 125 (=1005 AD) mentions that King Nirvaya Déva established the temple of Bhairava in Taumadhi tole of Bhaktapur. The temple was established as a one-storey building but today has been expanded by various future kings to a tall three storey temple with a golden roof on the top. In Nepal Sambat 822 (= 1702–1703 AD) King Bhupatindra Malla commissioned the construction of the Nyatapola temple right next to it. ===Medieval Bhaktapur=== ====Formal establishment of Bhaktapur==== King Ananda Déva Malla is credited with the foundation of the city of Bhaktapur in the 12th century. He was the youngest son of Abhaya Malla and after the invocation of Annapurna Dévi, founded a city with 12,000 households under her supervision. Just like the city of Patan which was established in the shape of a Dharma Chakra, the entirety of the city was established in the shape of the conch of Lord Vishnu.( for the followers of Shiva, the shape of the city is interpreted as the damaru or the drum of Shiva) After the founding of the city, Ananda Déva was approached by the group of Nine mother goddesses (Ajimā in Newari) in his dream and under their command established the shrines of Eight Matrikas, one on each corner of the town. The shrine for the final and the most powerful of the mother goddesses, Tripura Sundari was established on the center of the town. Therefore, the entirety of Bhaktapur is regarded as a sacred object, in this case a mandalā, with the shrines of Eight Matrikas on each corner of the mandala with the shrine of Tripura Sundari was established on the centre of the sacred Mandala. The mother goddesses are believed to protect the city from tantric dangers and evil spirits. Ananda Déva ruled from the Tripura Lyākū, the royal palace which was erected near and named after the shrine of Tripura Sundari. Tripura Lyākū was built in the Granthakuta style of architecture (similar to the Shikhara style from North India) and had seven gajūs in it. ====Sacking of Bhaktapur and the introduction of Taleju Bhavani==== In 1349AD, Nepal Mandala was attacked by the armies of the Bengali Shah Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah. Bhaktapur suffered the most from this attack as not only it was the capital at that time, the city was also in the eastern part of the valley, the same direction the 20,000 forces came from. The forces broke through the city gates, destroying infrastructure and looting valuables. The forces slaughtered men and women of Bhaktapur, although the casualties are unknown and the entire city was set on fire which lasted for seven days, effectively destroying the city. Inside the Mū Chuka, the main courtyard of the royal palace of Bhaktapur is said to house the Yantra of goddess Taleju, the tutelary deity of the Malla Kings and is said to have brought in the 14th century by Harisimhadeva of Simraungadh when he came to seek refuge in Bhaktapur. It is said that Harisimhadeva brought with him the Yantra of Goddess Taleju, which originally belonged to Indra and later Rama. The Malla kings of then is said to have accepted her as a Tutelary deity.Bhani, Tirthalal, श्री तलेजु भवानी(Nepali), an excerpt from the book, Prachin Nepal (Ne:प्राचीन नेपाल).pp 7-17 But some historians suggest that the tale is just a legend and the Goddess called as Taleju has been worshipped since the Licchavi times with the name of \"Maneshvori\"(Devanagari: मानेश्वरी) and the term Taleju was only used in the Late Malla era(16th century onwards) to refer to the same goddess. The royal palace of Bhaktapur, the Yuthunīma(m) Lyākū was built around the courtyard of Taleju. Yakshya Malla was the last king of a unified Nepal Mandala who ruled from Bhaktapur from 1428 to 1481. It was during his reign that the territory of the kingdom expanded to Mithila in the south and Tibet in the north. In order to protect his capital while he was away on battle, he fortified Bhaktapur and strengthened the city gates which correspond with the shrines of the Eight Matrikas. He also fortified the royal palace square of Bhaktapur. Yakshya Malla was also a religious minded King and has built various temples and viharas, especially in Bhaktapur and Patan. The Yakshésvara temple located in Durbar Square of Bhaktapur is a replica of Pashupatinath temple of Kathmandu and is named after himself. The temple of Dattatreya of Bhaktapur, the only one of its kind in Nepal was also built by him. === Kingdom of Bhaktapur (late 15th century to late 18th century) === thumb|Front face of the Nhékanjhya Lyākū (also called as Simhādhwākhā Lyākū), the main administrative building of Bhaktapur during its time as an independent kingdom, as it looked like in 1853. This palace no longer exists today. After the death of Jayayakshya Malla, his kingdom was divided among his sons of which the eldest, Raya Malla got the throne of Bhaktapur. Bhaktapur was one of the three major kingdoms of medieval Kathmandu Valley, the other being Kantipur and Patan. Bhaktapur had a poor relationship with Kantipur and both these kingdoms had attempted to invade each other at various occasions. With Patan, Bhaktapur had a very contingent relationship although they both had good relations for most of the duration of the Late Medieval period. All three of the kingdom however competed with each other in the fields of arts and architecture. As a result, many vibrant palaces and temples were built by each of kingdoms in their capital and royal squares or the Durbar Square with the hopes of out beautifying each other. This period in Nepalese history is often compared with the Italian Renaissance. It was in this period that many of Bhaktapur's iconic structures were built. Kings like Jagat Prakasha Malla, Jitamitra Malla and Bhupatindra Malla are often credited with many of the city's heritages. The tall Nyatapola Temple built by Bhupatindra Malla is today used by the city as its icon. Various new palaces were also built like Thantu Lyākū by King Jitamitra Malla, Basantapur Lyākū by King Jagat Prakasha Malla and Simhādhwākhā Lyākū along with the palace of fifty-five windows by Bhupatindra Malla. Italian missionary Ippolito Desideri who visited the Kathmandu Valley from 27 December 1721, to 14 January 1722, wrote the following about Bhaktapur: === Annexation into the Gorkha Kingdom and Rana period === After the Battle of Bhaktapur, Bhaktapur was annexed into the expanding Gorkha kingdom. Around 2,000 people died and more than 500 homes were set on fire as a result of the Battle. Bhaktapur lost the political and cultural importance to Kathmandu and the development in arts in the city came to a halt. With the shift of capital to Kathmandu and Patan, most of the intellectuals and upper- class families of Bhaktapur left the city for the capital leaving only the farmers and other middle and lower caste people in the city. The influx of Tibetan traders was what had kept the city rich before but due to the centralisation of power after its annexation, Bhaktapur lost many of these traders to Kathmandu. Moreover, in the 19th century the British opened a new and shorter trade route to Tibet through Kalimpong and Nathu La which weakened Bhaktapur's role as a trade hub thereby crippling the economy of the city and until about recently Bhaktapur never recovered from this economic disaster. In 1856 Dhir Shumsher Rana, the then Governor of Bhaktapur deconstructed half of the royal palace of Nhēkanjhya Lyākū and reconstructed it in a British style of architecture. This new building was called the \"Lal Baithak\" (). === The great earthquake of 1833 and 1934 === thumb|240x240px|A watercolour of the western part of Bhaktapur Durbar Square from 1853 which shows the Basantapur Lyākū (back right) in worn out condition and the Chaukot Lyākū (front right) both of which no longer exists today. The great earthquake of 1833 and 1934 damaged most of the city including the palace and temples. In the earthquake of 1833, Bhaktapur suffered the most damage in the Kathmandu Valley. Out of 500 total casualties of the earthquake, at least 200 of them were in Bhaktapur. Around 25% to 70% of the town suffered major destruction, including at least 2,000 homes and six to eight temples. When the 8.0 magnitude earthquake struck in 1934, Bhaktapur was one of the most affected towns of Nepal. Around 40-100% of residential buildings were directly affected while 6224 buildings were completely destroyed by the earthquake. Many of the old palaces and temples which were already weakened by the earthquake of 1833 were also completely destroyed. Almost all the buildings in Bhaktapur Durbar Square were heavily damaged. Around 177 heritages were completely destroyed during the earthquake. Various Malla era a palaces like the Basantapur Lyākū, Chaukot Lyākū and Thanthu Lyākū were completely destroyed. Following are the short descriptions of various palaces and temples lost in the earthquake and never remade: ==== Thanthu Lyākū ==== Thanthu Lyākū was first constructed by King Jitamitra Malla in the late 17th century and featured various gardens, balconies and water conduits. It occupied a large area in the upper part of the Durbar Square and was called as Thanthu Lyākū from the Newari word Thanthu meaning \"upper part\" and Lyākū meaning \"place of the royals\". This palace fell out of importance after the annexation of Bhaktapur and due to lack of maintenance and repairs was destroyed by the earthquakes of 1833 and 1934. Today, only one of the courtyards of the palace, the Lūnhiti Chwoka, containing the golden spout and the royal bath survives. The area where this palace once stood has been converted into various administrative buildings. Jitamitra Malla, the king who first made the palace had written the following about Thanthu Lyākū palace in a stone inscription: ==== Basantapur Lyākū ==== Basantapur Lyākū nine storey building that was erected by King Jagat Prakasha Malla on the eastern part of Bhaktapur Durbar Square and named it as nakhāchhé–tavagola–kwātha, meaning \"large fort meant for festivals\". However, the other collapsed palaces like the five storey fort of Chaukot Lyākū and the 23 m tall Basantapur Lyākū were never remade. Other buildings like the Chyasilin Mandap and the temple of Hari Shankar were also never remade. However, Chyasilin Mandap was remade by the German Government in the 1980s as a part of the Bhaktapur Development Project (BDP). The BDP also reconstructed the 18th century Pūjāri Matha as a wedding gift for the then crown prince Birendra of Nepal. The economy of Bhaktapur which had already been struggling after losing the flow of Tibetan traders was greatly crippled by the earthquake of 1833 and 1934. The 1934 earthquake also damaged the physical infrastructure of the town and most of the inhabitants were unable to rebuild their houses properly. The earthquake permanently damaged the Rajkulo canals that had been providing fresh water to the city since the time of the Mallas. An economically struggling Bhaktapur was unable to repair these canals and as a result fresh water became scarce in the city. The sanitation level of Bhaktapur became severely low and poverty and diseases became rampant. === 20th century onwards === In the 1950s Kathmandu and the other cities around it like Patan saw a big rise in urbanization and population. However, Bhaktapur was farther away from the capital and was left out from the development that occurred in the other cities of the Kathmandu Valley. Bhaktapur was also greatly isolated and ignored by the central powers. When a new highway was built, it completely bypassed the city and instead ran through the outskirts. Travellers from the east who wanted to reach the capital of Kathmandu once used to pass through Bhaktapur but after the construction of the highway, these travellers simply rode a bus to Kathmandu. Bhaktapur was the poorest city of Nepal in the 20th century. The Rajkulo canals that provided fresh water was never repaired and sanitation level was very low. Due to extremely high population density and low sanitation, the city became extremely unhygienic as feces and litter filled the roads. Diseases were rampant and greatly affected the farmer majority population of Bhaktapur couldn't afford modern medicine. Just like the inhabitants, the heritages of Bhaktapur also suffered greatly during this period as many arts and artifacts were stolen. The Bhaktapur Development Project which was initiated by the German government which aimed to restore Bhaktapur to its former glory. ==Demographics== Italian missionary Ippolito Desideri who visited Bhaktapur in January 1722 wrote that there are \"several hundred thousand\" inhabitants in the city. The rāga song composed by Ranajit Malla, the last king of Bhaktapur in 1769 AD mention Bhaktapur as a kingdom with 12,000 households. When King Ananda Deva founded Bhaktapur in the 12th century it was said to have 12,000 homes as well. Henry Ambrose Oldfield who visited Nepal during the 1850s wrote that there are fifty thousand inhabitants in Bhaktapur. At the time of the 2001 Nepal census, it had a population of 72,543.City Population . Retrieved: 9 December 2011. The 2011 Nepal census reports the population of Bhaktapur as 81,748 with 41,081 men and 40,667 women. The preliminary results of the 2021 Nepal census put the population of Bhaktapur at 78,854 with the population of men at 39,664 and of women at 39,140. Around 90% of the population of Bhaktapur belong to the Newar ethnic group. ==Main sights== thumb|Tachapāl square on the eastern part of Bhaktapur is also known as the Dattaterya square. Bhaktapur is one of the most visited sites of Nepal popular among both foreign and domestic visitors. The most visited site of Bhaktapur are the city's four squares, which all except for one are concentrated on the middle part of Bhaktapur. The first of them is the Durbar Square (, Lyākū), the former royal palace complex of Bhaktapur and houses the former royal palace and various temples that were built in its vicinity. Although, the Durbar Square of Bhaktapur received heavy damage from both the 1934 and 2015 earthquake, many of the fallen monuments have been reconstructed. The Durbar square houses various monuments like the palace of fifty five windows, the Simhādhwākhā Lyākū palace which houses the National Art Gallery, one of the first museum of Nepal, the stone temple of Vatsala Devi and Siddhi Lakshmi. The temple of Silu Māhādeo (meaning \"the Shiva of Silu\") located on the eastern part of Bhaktapur Durbar Square is the tallest Shikhara style building in Nepal. The Taumadhi Square (, Tamārhi) houses the Nyatapola temple, the five storeyed temple commissioned by King Bhupatindra Malla and shrines the tantric goddess Siddhi Lakshmi, the personal deity of the royal couple. Under the shadow of Nyatapola stands the three storey temple associated with Bhairava which was first built by Vishva Malla and then later remodeled by Jagajjyoti Malla in its present form. The square also contains the courtyard of Til Mādhav Narayana, the Aesāmārhi satta(often called the Kasthamandap of Bhaktapur), the Betala temple and a golden hiti. The Shikhara temple of Jagannath and the roofed temple of Lakshmi Narasimha are also established near the square. The Dattatraya Suqare located in the Tachapal tole (Nepal bhasa: Devanagari=तचपाल,Pracalit script=𑐟𑐔𑐥𑐵𑐮) is one of the oldest monument of the town. The Dattatraya Square consists of the three-story pagoda-style Dattatraya Temple, dedicated to Guru Dattatreya, which is the combined form of three principal Hindu deities, (Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver, and Maheswora the destroyer), was built during the reign of King Yaksha Malla (1428 A.D. – 1482 A.D.) and was opened to the public around 1486 A.D., only after his demise. The exact date of construction of the Dattatraya temple is still obscure. This temple, according to popular belief, was constructed from a single piece of wood from one tree. At the entrance are two large sculptures of the Jaiput wrestlers(locally known as kutuwo), Jaimala and Pata (as in the Nyatapola Temple), a \"Chakra\", and a gilded metal statue of Garuda, a bird-like divinity. Around the temple are wood carved panels with erotic decorations. It was subsequently repaired and renovated by King Vishwa Malla in 1548 A.D. The Dattatraya Square is also the home to the Pujari Math which was the former palace of the Malla Kings and later served as the settlement for the priests of the temple and Tibetan traders. Today, the Pujari Math has been converted into a Woodcraft and Bronze Museum. The Pujari Matha is mostly noted for its artistic windows including the popular Mhaykhā Jhyā (lit.Peacock Window). In front of the Dattatraya temple is the Bhimsena Temple which is dedicated to Bhin:dyo, the Newari deity of commerce often confused with the Pandava brother Bhimsena. ===Changu Narayan=== thumb|left|Front face of Changu Narayan temple Changu Narayan is an ancient Hindu temple located near the village of Changunarayan in the Kathmandu Valley on top of a hill at the eastern end of the valley. It is to the north of Bhakathapur and from Kathmandu. The temple is one of the oldest Hindu temples of the valley and is believed to have been constructed first in the 4th century. Changu Narayan is the name of Vishnu, and the temple is dedicated to him. A stone slab discovered in the vicinity of the temple dates to the 5th century and is the oldest such stone inscription discovered in Nepal. It was rebuilt after the old temple was devastated. Many of the stone sculptures date to the Licchavi period. Changu Narayan Temple is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The temple is a double-roofed structure where the idol of Lord Vishnu in his incarnation as Narayana is deified. The temple has intricate roof struts showing multi-armed Tantric deities. A kneeling image of Garuda (dated to the 5th century), the vahana or vehicle of Vishnu with a snake around its neck, faces the temple. The gilded door depicts stone lions guarding the temple. Gilded windows also flank the door. A conch and a disc, symbols of Vishnu, are carved on the two pillars at the entrance. Non-Hindus are not allowed inside the temple.Destination Nepal: Bhaktapur .

The height of this statue is 143 feet high and is situated 20 km from Kathmandu, Nepal. The statues construction work was started in 2004 and was completed in 2012. The statue's inauguration took place on 21 June 2012. This statue stands on the 32nd position in the list of all statues by height in the world. It has been made of copper, cement, zinc and steel. To make this gigantic structure possible there were many professional workers and statue makers from India. ==In popular culture== Portions of the Hollywood film Little Buddha starring Keanu Reeves and Bridget Fonda were filmed in the Bhaktapur Durbar Square. Also, portions of Indian films Hare Rama Hare Krishna and Baby were shot in Bhaktapur. ==2015 earthquake== left|thumb|Bhaktapur Durbar Square Under construction after 25 April 2015 earthquake A magnitude of 7.8 Richter earthquake 2015 Nepal earthquake that struck on 25 April 2015 (12 Baisakh 2072 B.S., Saturday, at local time 11:56am) damaged 116 heritages in the city. 67 of those heritages were completely damaged while 49 suffered from partial damages. The earthquake badly damaged the Bhaktapur Durbar square, a significant heritage site included in the UNESCO world heritage list. The main premises of Taleju Temple also witnessed damages in the disaster. The Nepal-Bihar earthquake in 1934 demolished several buildings that were never rebuilt. Chyasilin Mandap has been rebuilt in 1990 using contemporary earthquake proof technology. The building survived the 2015 earthquake unharmed.The Eight Cornered Gift, 15 October 2014, Kapil Bisht ==See also== * Battle of Bhaktapur ==Gallery== File:Street scene, Bhaktapur, Nepal. 1979.jpg|Street scene, Bhaktapur, Nepal. 1979 File:Street of Bhaktapur at night.jpg|Street of Bhaktapur at night File:Bhaktapur Durbar Square.jpg|Bhaktapur Durbar Square File:Bhaktapur-city- centre-large.jpg|Bhaktapur Taumadhi square.
