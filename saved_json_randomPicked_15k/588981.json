 "text": "The provinces of Bulgaria () are the first-level administrative subdivisions of the country. Since 1999, Bulgaria has been divided into 28 provinces ( – oblasti; singular: – oblast; also translated as \"regions\") which correspond approximately to the 28 districts (in – okrǎg, plural: – okrǎzi), that existed before 1987. The provinces are further subdivided into 265 municipalities (singular: – obshtina, plural: – obshtini). Sofia – the capital city of Bulgaria and the largest settlement in the country – is the administrative centre of both Sofia Province and Sofia City Province (Sofia-grad). The capital is included (together with three other cities plus 34 villages) in Sofia Capital Municipality (over 90% of whose population lives in Sofia), which is the sole municipality comprising Sofia City province. == Terminology == The provinces do not have official names – legally (in the President's decree on their constitution), they are not named but only described as \"oblast with administrative centre [Noun]\" – together with a list of the constituting municipalities. In Bulgaria they are usually called \"[Adjective] Oblast\"; occasionally they are referred to as \"Oblast [Noun]\" and rarely as \"oblast with administrative centre [Noun]\". The Bulgarian term \"област\" (oblast) is preferably translated into English as \"province\", in order to avoid disambiguation and distinguish from the former unit called \"окръг\" (okrag, translated as \"district\") and the term \"регион\" (always translated as \"region\"). At any rate, \"district\" and \"region\" are sometimes still used to name these contemporary 28 units. * \"region\": \"28 regions (en) / région (fr) / oblast (bg)\" – in ISO 3166-2 Newsletter II-3 (2011-12-13, corrected 2011-12-15) * \"district\": \"The territory of the South Central Region encompasses five districts – Pazardzhik, Plovdiv, Smolyan, Haskovo, and Kyrdzhali.\" – in a website of the European Commission. == Provinces == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" rules=\"all\" style=\"border:1px solid #999; border- right:2px solid #999; border-bottom:2px solid #999; background-color:white; margin-top:1em; text-align:right;\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" |- !width=\"120px\"| Province !width=\"100px\"| Population (Census 2001) !width=\"100px\"| Population (Census 2011) !width=\"120px\"| Population growth (2001/2011) !width=\"100px\"| Land area (km2) !width=\"120px\"| Population density (/km2) !width=\"120px\"| Municipalities !width=\"120px\"| Planning Region |- |align=\"left\"| Blagoevgrad || 341,173 || 323,552 || −5.2% || 6,449.47 || 50.17 || 14 || South Western |align=\"left\"| Burgas || 423,547 || 415,817 || −1.8% || 7,748.07 || 54.58 || 13 || South Eastern |align=\"left\"| Dobrich || 215,217 || 189,677 || −11.9% || 4,719.71 || 40.36 || 8 || North Eastern |align=\"left\"| Gabrovo || 144,125 || 122,702 || −14.9% || 2,023.01 || 59.77 || 4 || North Central |align=\"left\"| Haskovo || 277,478 || 246,238 || −11.3% || 5,533.29 || 61.06 || 11 || South Central |align=\"left\"| Kardzhali || 164,019 || 152,808 || −6.8% || 3,209.11 || 37.90 || 7 || South Central |align=\"left\"| Kyustendil || 162,534 || 136,686 || −15.9% || 3,051.52 || 45.16 || 9 || South Western |align=\"left\"| Lovech || 169,951 || 141,422 || −16.8% || 4,128.76 || 34.21 || 8 || North Western |align=\"left\"| Montana || 182,258 || 148,098 || −18.7% || 3,635.38 || 41.20 || 11 || North Western |align=\"left\"| Pazardzhik || 310,723 || 275,548 || −11.3% || 4,456.92 || 62.72 || 12 || South Central |align=\"left\"| Pernik || 149,832 || 133,530 || −10.9% || 2,394.22 || 56.18 || 6 || South Western |align=\"left\"| Pleven || 311,985 || 269,752 || −13.5% || 4,653.32 || 63.98 || 11 || North Western |align=\"left\"| Plovdiv || 715,816 || 683,027 || −4.6% || 5,972.89 || 114.35 || 18 || South Central |align=\"left\"| Razgrad || 152,417 || 125,190 || −17.9% || 2,639.74 || 47.28 || 7 || North Central |align=\"left\"| Ruse || 266,157 || 235,252 || −11.6% || 2,803.36 || 89.93 || 8 || North Central |align=\"left\"| Shumen || 204,378 || 180,528 || −11.7% || 3,389.68 || 53.65 || 10 || North Eastern |align=\"left\"| Silistra || 142,000 || 119,474 || −15.9% || 2,846.29 || 41.74 || 7 || North Central |align=\"left\"| Sliven || 218,474 || 197,473 || −9.6% || 3,544.07 || 54.16 || 4 || South Eastern |align=\"left\"| Smolyan || 140,066 || 121,752 || −13.1% || 3,192.85 || 34.47 || 10 || South Central |align=\"left\"| Sofia City || 1,170,842 || 1,291,591 || +10.3% || 1,348.90 || 957.44 || 1 || South Western |align=\"left\"| Sofia (province) || 273,240 || 247,489 || −9.4% || 7,062.33 || 34.01 || 22 || South Western |align=\"left\"| Stara Zagora || 370,615 || 333,265 || −10.1% || 5,151.12 || 67.20 || 11 || South Eastern |align=\"left\"| Targovishte || 137,689 || 120,818 || −12.3% || 2,558.53 || 44.17 || 5 || North Eastern |align=\"left\"| Varna || 462,013 || 475,074 || +2.8% || 3,819.47 || 124.40 || 12 || North Eastern |align=\"left\"| Veliko Tarnovo || 293,172 || 258,494 || −11.8% || 4,661.57 || 55.19 || 10 || North Central |align=\"left\"| Vidin || 130,074 || 101,018 || −22.3% || 3,032.88 || 32.89 || 11 || North Western |align=\"left\"| Vratsa || 243,036 || 186,848 || −23.1% || 3,619.77 || 45.59 || 10 || North Western |align=\"left\"| Yambol || 156,070 || 131,447 || −15.8% || 3,355.48 || 31.23 || 5 || South Eastern |} == History == thumbnail|300px|Provinces (with ex-districts) in 1987–1999 thumb|right|300px|Provinces of Bulgaria from 1987 to 1998 In 1987, the then- existing 28 districts were transformed into 9 large units (in Bulgarian called oblasts – provinces), which survived until 1999.→ The 9 large provinces are listed below, along with the pre-1987 districts (post-1999 small provinces) comprising them. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! 1987–1998 oblasts !!
