At the same time, he devoted a lot of efforts to science communication, on the international stage. === Vincent van Gogh painting === His professional interests include asteroids and comets, variable stars and extrasolar planets, with many contributions in all those fields. He was able to determine the date that Vincent van Gogh painted Starry Night Over the Rhone by studying the star placement. === Virtual Telescope project === In 2006 he started the Virtual Telescope project (part of Bellatrix Astronomical Observatory), consisting of several robotic telescopes, remotely available in real-time over the Internet. Through this system, real time online observations are performed; sharing the universe with the world. More than 1,000,000 individuals each year observe the sky through the Virtual Telescope. == Awards and honors == He received a number of prizes, including the Ruggieri Prize (2003), the Gene Shoemaker NEO Grant (2005) and the Tacchini Prize (2006) as well as other acknowledgements for his scientific activities. The Nysian asteroid 21795 Masi, discovered by his college Franco Mallia in 1999, was named in his honor. == List of discovered minor planets == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 89%; float: left; width: 26em; margin-right: 1em; height: 420px; |- | 10931 Ceccano || 16 February 1998 || |- | 20433 Prestinenza || 14 February 1999 || |- | 20513 Lazio || 10 September 1999 || |- | 21661 Olgagermani || 1 September 1999 || |- | 21685 Francomallia || 11 September 1999 || |- | 21799 Ciociaria || 1 October 1999 || |- | || 6 August 1999 || |- | 40409 Taichikato || 6 September 1999 || |- | 49501 Basso || 13 February 1999 || |- | || 9 February 2003 || |- | 66458 Romaplanetario || 22 August 1999 || |- | 73453 Ninomanfredi || 13 July 2002 || |- | 74625 Tieproject || 10 September 1999 || |- | 79641 Daniloceirani || 19 September 1998 || |- | || 28 March 2003 || |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 89%; float: left; width: 26em; margin- right: 1em; height: 420px; |- | 98722 Elenaumberto || 22 December 2000 || |- | 101902 Gisellaluccone || 3 September 1999 || |- | 145820 Valeromeo || 15 October 1998 || |- | 216591 Coetzee || 21 July 2002 || |- | || 13 February 2003 || |- | 243637 Frosinone || 8 October 1999 || |- | || 11 February 2003 || |- | 269762 Nocentini || 4 October 1999 || |- | || 11 February 2003 || |- | || 13 February 2003 || |- | || 14 March 2007 || |- ! colspan=3 style=\"font- weight: normal; text-align: left; padding: 24px 12px;\" |Co-discovery made with: F.
