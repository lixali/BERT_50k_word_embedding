 "text": "The Grand Army Plaza station is a local station on the IRT Eastern Parkway Line of the New York City Subway. It is located in Park Slope, Brooklyn, underneath Flatbush Avenue at its intersection with Plaza Street West and St. Johns Place, on the northwest side of Grand Army Plaza. It is served by the 2 train at all times, the 3 train at all times except late nights, and the 4 train during late nights. == History == The Bergen Street, Grand Army Plaza, and Eastern Parkway–Brooklyn Museum stations opened on October 9, 1920. Service on the IRT Eastern Parkway Line had been extended from Atlantic Avenue to Utica Avenue in August 1920, but the three stations were not ready to open with the rest of the line. This extension was part of an expansion of the subway system known as the Dual Contracts which built not only IRT lines in Brooklyn but also those for the BMT. The BMT Brighton Line was already in use at the time but used trackage that is now part of the Franklin Avenue Shuttle; the opening of the subway line beneath Flatbush Avenue provided a more direct route to Downtown Brooklyn and, eventually, Manhattan. The construction of the station and tunnels resulted in the removal of Frederic W. Darlington's 1897 Electric Fountain from the center of Grand Army Plaza, which was dug up for the cut-and-cover construction and replaced with a grass oval. Construction began on a new fountain, known as the Bailey Fountain, in 1928, and it was completed in 1932.New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, Grand Army Plaza, accessed April 20, 2007 During the 1964–1965 fiscal year, the platforms at Grand Army Plaza, along with those at four other stations on the Eastern Parkway Line, were lengthened to 525 feet to accommodate a ten-car train of 51-foot IRT cars. == Station layout == {|table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=50|G |style=\"border- top:solid 1px gray;\" width=150|Street level |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=525|Exit/entrance |- |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|M |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|Mezzanine |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|Fare control, station agent |- |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" rowspan=3 valign=top|P |style=\"border- top:solid 1px gray;\"|Northbound local |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|← toward () ← toward () ← toward late nights () |- |style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border- right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Island platform |- |style=\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Southbound local |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"| toward () → ( late nights) toward () → |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" rowspan=4 valign=top|Express/Brighton Tracks |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Northbound express |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|← do not stop here |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" rowspan=2|Brighton Line |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|← do not stop here |- |style=\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\"| do not stop here → |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Southbound express |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"| do not stop here → |} thumb|left|A view of the station's platform At platform level, Grand Army Plaza has a simple island platform layout with two tracks.
