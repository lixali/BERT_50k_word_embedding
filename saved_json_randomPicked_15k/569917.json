 "text": "BBC Radio Tees is the BBC's local radio station serving parts of County Durham and North Yorkshire. It broadcasts on FM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios on Newport Road in Middlesbrough. According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 115,000 listeners and a 3.4% share as of September 2021. == History == ===BBC Radio Teesside=== The station was originally launched as Radio Teesside at 6 pm on 31 December 1970 with a local news programme entitled Teesside Tonight, presented by George Lambelle, who later won five major programming awards. ===BBC Radio Cleveland=== thumb|BBC Radio Cleveland - Middlesbrough On 1 April 1974 the station became known as Radio Cleveland, when the county of Cleveland was formed. The station moved to new offices in 1983. On 1 April 1996, the county of Cleveland split into Stockton- on-Tees, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, and Redcar and Cleveland. These four boroughs along with nearby Darlington now form the governmental sub-region of Tees Valley. Also included in the main coverage area is the Army's main garrison at Catterick Garrison, which is also included in the transmission area of Radio York on 104.3 FM. ===BBC Tees=== file: BBC Tees.png On Saturday 11 August 2007 the station rebranded itself as BBC Tees, due to its broadcasting area no longer being associated with the name Cleveland. The BBC Tees brand was already associated with its 'Where I Live' website and 'BBC Bus', which have both since been discontinued. ===BBC Radio Tees=== On 27 January 2020 the station was rebranded as BBC Radio Tees, the addition of radio in all of BBCâ€™s local radio stations was to avoid confusion with its similarly named TV news regions. ==Transmitters== Before moving to Eston Nab, the signal on 95 FM originally was relatively strong and came from the 900-foot Bilsdale transmitter on the North York Moors, which transmitted the main television signals for Teesside and North Yorkshire, and national radio frequencies, as well as the commercial stations TFM, 100-102 Real Radio and Capital FM on 106.4 FM. A relay transmitter covering the town of Whitby broadcasts on 95.8 FM. The DAB signals come from the Bauer 11B multiplex at Eston Nab (near the A174 road) and Brusselton (near Shildon between the A68 and A6072). On 10 August 2021, FM transmission was knocked off air indefinitely following a fire at the Bilsdale site. It is feared that the structural integrity of the transmitter mast may have been compromised. As at 11 August 2021, the 95 FM service is available again, using the Eston Nab transmitter, but it does not reach all areas of the station's transmission area. A temporary transmitter on 104.0 FM has also been instated for Darlington and the surrounding areas. The station also broadcast on medium wave until 1992. BBC Radio Tees is also available on DAB in Teesside, County Durham and North Yorkshire and online via BBC Sounds. In addition, the station also broadcasts on Freeview TV channel 722. ==Programming== Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC's Middlesbrough studios from 6am - 10pm each day. The late show, airing from 10pm - 1am, originates from BBC Radio Newcastle every night. During the station's downtime, BBC Radio Tees simulcasts overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Radio London. ===Notable past presenters=== *Ali Brownlee *Richard Hammond ==References== == External links == *BBC Radio Tees * History of local radio in Cleveland and Durham *MDS975's Transmitter Map *Bilsdale West Moor transmitter *Whitby transmitter Category:Radio stations established in 1970 Tees Category:County Durham Category:North Yorkshire Category:Mass media in Yorkshire Category:Teesside Category:Radio stations in North East England Category:1970 establishments in England",
