 "text": "thumb|right Tuinal was the brand name of a discontinued combination drug composed of two barbiturate salts (secobarbital sodium and amobarbital sodium) in equal proportions. Tuinal was introduced as a sedative-hypnotic (sleeping pill) medication in the late 1940s by Eli Lilly. It was produced in brightly colored half-reddish orange and half-turquoise blue gelatin capsule form (bullet-shaped Pulvules) for oral administration. Individual capsules contained 50 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg of barbiturate salts. The combination of a short-acting barbiturate, Secobarbital, with an intermediate-acting barbiturate, Amobarbital, aimed to put users to sleep quickly, and to keep them asleep through the night. Eli Lilly has discontinued the manufacture of Tuinal in the United States due to the diminishing use of barbiturates (replaced by the benzodiazepine family of drugs) in outpatient treatment, and its widespread abuse. Currently, Valleant Labs markets Secobarbital capsules only. Flynn Pharma of Ireland no longer manufactures Tuinal, Seconal or Amytal (amobarbital). Amytal has been discontinued, though sodium amytal injection form remains. ==Abuse== frame|right Tuinal saw widespread abuse as a recreational drug from the 1960s through the 1980s. The pill was known colloquially under the street names \"tuies\", \"tumies\", \"double trouble\", \"blue tips\", \" F-66's\" (which were the markings on Lilly's capsule), \"rainbows\", \"beans\", \"nawls\" and \"jeebs\". It came in the form of bullet-shaped capsules, half-reddish orange and half-turquoise blue. Like other barbiturate depressants, Tuinal promotes physical and psychological dependency and carries a high risk of overdose. Abuse of this particular drug tapered off after it was discontinued by manufacturers in the late 1990s, largely replaced by the benzo family of drugs. Tuinal is classified as a Schedule II drug under the Controlled Substances Act in the United States, meaning it requires a prescription from a licensed practitioner. Oscar Levant wrote in his book The Unimportance of Being Oscar, \"If I had the choice between the most beautiful girl in the world and three grams of Tuonol [sic], I would take the latter.\" Arthur Koestler and his wife Cynthia jointly committed suicide on March 1, 1983, by swallowing lethal quantities of Tuinal capsules at their London home. Singer Phyllis Hyman also committed suicide by overdosing on a mixture of Tuinal and vodka in her New York City apartment on June 30, 1995, hours before she was scheduled to perform at the Apollo Theater. ==Popular culture references== ===Fiction=== *In Ian Fleming's short story \"The Living Daylights\" (published in Octopussy and The Living Daylights, 1966) Commander Bond takes the drug before an assault on a KGB sniper: \"He selected the Tuinal, chased down two of the ruby and blue depth-charges with a glass of water, and went back to bed.
