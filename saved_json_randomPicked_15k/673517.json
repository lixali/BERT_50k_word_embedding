 "text": "Ahuntsic was a federal electoral district in Quebec, Canada, that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1968 to 1979 and from 1988 to 2015. ==Geography== The district included the neighbourhoods of Ahuntsic and Bordeaux-Cartierville and the western part of the neighbourhood of Sault- au-Recollet in the Borough of Ahuntsic-Cartierville. Prior to being abolished, its neighbouring ridings were Papineau, Mount Royal, Saint- Laurent—Cartierville, Laval, Alfred-Pellan, Bourassa, and Saint-Léonard—Saint- Michel. ==History== The electoral district of Ahuntsic was created in 1966 from Saint-Denis and Laval ridings. In 1976, it was abolished when it was redistributed into Saint-Michel riding. In 1987, the new district of Ahuntsic was created from Saint-Michel—Ahuntsic and Saint-Denis. From 1993 to 2008 Ahuntsic was usually a competitive seat between Bloc Québécois and the Liberals. However, in 2011 Bloc Québécois incumbent Maria Mourani narrowly won reelection against a New Democratic surge that swept through Montreal and Quebec in general. Ahuntsic was the sole seat retained by Bloc Québécois in the Montreal area and one of only four won by the party overall at the 2011 federal election. ===Members of Parliament=== This riding has elected the following Members of Parliament: ==Election results== ===Ahuntsic, 1988–2015=== |- |- |- |align=\"left\" colspan=2|Liberal hold |align=\"right\"|Swing |align=\"right\"| -9.6 |align=\"right\"| Note: Conservative vote is compared to the total of the Canadian Alliance vote and Progressive Conservative vote in 2000 election. ===Ahuntsic, 1968–1979=== Note: Social Credit vote is compared to Ralliement créditiste vote in the 1968 election. ==See also== * List of Canadian federal electoral districts * Past Canadian electoral districts ==Notes== ==References== * *Riding history 1966-1976 from the Library of Parliament *Riding history 1987-2008 from the Library of Parliament *Elections Canada, 2011 General Election Results, Ahuntsic *Campaign expense data from Elections Canada Category:Defunct Quebec federal electoral districts Category:Ahuntsic-Cartierville",
