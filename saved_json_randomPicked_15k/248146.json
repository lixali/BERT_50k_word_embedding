Image:Cameo-Kid.jpg Image:Record Sleeve (Obverse) for 7 inch CAMEO-KID.JPG Image:Record Sleeve (Reverse) for 7 inch CAMEO-KID.JPG Cameo-Kid was a subsidiary of Cameo Records, marketing recordings intended for children. Cameo-Kid used professional artists with known names in their recordings, including star Vaudeville singers and noted dance-band musicians. This was unlike some other early Children's records labels, which tended to feature recordings by unnamed and undistinguished talent. Cameo-Kid artists probably recorded these discs while in the Cameo studios for recording more mainstream records. Cameo-Kid Records are double-sided 7-inch gramophone records. ==See also== * List of record labels Category:Defunct record labels of the United States",
