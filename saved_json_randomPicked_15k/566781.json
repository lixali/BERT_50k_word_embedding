 "text": "Solar Eclipse is a 1995 space flight simulation video game developed and published by Crystal Dynamics, released exclusively for the Sega Saturn in North America and Japan. Solar Eclipse was developed under the title \"Titan\", but the American marketing team decided it would sell better if published as a sequel to the 1994 video game Total Eclipse, especially as the two featured similar gameplay and graphical style. A port called Titan Wars was released in Europe for the PlayStation, in November 1996. ==Gameplay== Solar Eclipse is a hybrid of rail shooter and free-roaming space combat simulation; the general direction of the ship's flight is locked in, but the player may maneuver vertically and horizontally over a substantial area, and can at certain points choose from multiple routes. ==Reception== The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Saturn version a 7.75 out of 10 average. They praised the intense gameplay, the considerable strategy required to elude enemy fire, and the solid graphics. GamePros Captain Squideo had a more mixed reaction, criticizing the partially on-rails flight and saying the landscapes and enemies become repetitious. He concluded that the game is nonetheless fun to play and \"eclipses most other shooters\", but that these problems would discourage repeat plays. ==References== Category:1995 video games Category:Crystal Dynamics games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:Rail shooters Category:Science fiction video games Category:Sega Saturn games Category:Space combat simulators Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games scored by Burke Trieschmann",
