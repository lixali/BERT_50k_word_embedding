Albert Burckhardt und Rudolf Wackernagel, Basel 1900, S. 249–254. In 1864, large parts of the city were destroyed by fire, including the old town hall; a new neo-Gothic town hall was built in its stead. A connection for the city of Horn to the railway connection was made in 1895. The station was built outside the city center and is located on the route Detmold-Altenbeken. ==Settlement Moorlage== In the east of Horn arose at the beginning of World War II, the settlement Moorlage . Reason was the relocation of the village Haustenbeck in Senne, which was given to the Sennelager Training Area. Many people from the community moved to Horn, where the company Künnemeyer needed workers. The farmers received courtyards of the Reichsumsiedlungsgesellschaft. On February 18, 1938, the first proposal was made to build a closed settlement. Some forty families settled around to Horn. End of August 1939 arrived the first domestic, mayor Wilhelm Mehrmann. 1989 were still 42 of 44 settlement houses owned by the families, who they also built before the war. ==References== ==External links== * Official website * Official website Category:Lippe Category:Teutoburg Forest Category:Spa towns in Germany",
