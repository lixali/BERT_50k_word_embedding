 "text": "Running on Ice is the second album by Vertical Horizon, released independently in 1995, and later re-released by RCA. It was produced by John Alagia (John Mayer, Dave Matthews Band), Doug Derryberry and Matt Scannell. Though still technically a duo and acoustic based, Running on Ice featured many guest musicians (most notably Carter Beauford of the Dave Matthews Band on drums), giving the album more of a full band sound. Derryberry also contributed keyboards and vocals. Two of the album's songs (\"Wash Away\" and \"The Man Who Would Be Santa\") appeared on the 2nd Aware Compilation. ==Track listing== #\"Heart in Hand\" (Scannell) - 4:36 #\"Wash Away\" (Kane) - 4:30 #\"Fragments\" (Scannell) - 3:47 #\"Famous\" (Kane/Scannell) - 3:03 #\"The Man Who Would Be Santa\" (Scannell) - 4:43 #\"Angel Without Wings\" (Kane) - 4:19 #\"Answer Me\" (Scannell) - 5:31 #\"Life in the City\" (Scannell) - 4:13 #\"Japan\" (Kane) - 5:24 #\"Call it Even\" (Scannell) - 3:40 #\"Sunrays and Saturdays\" (Scannell) - 3:33 #\"Candyman\" (Kane) - 4:16 #\"Falling Down\" (Moylan/Scannell) - 4:12 #\"Goodnight My Friend\" (Scannell) - 6:33 ==References== Category:Vertical Horizon albums Category:1995 albums Category:Albums produced by John Alag√≠a Category:Aware Records albums Category:RCA Records albums",
