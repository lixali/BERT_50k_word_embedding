In 2018, Hunan University was elected among 16 universities in the world by the academic journal Nature, called \"Movers and Shakers\". == History == Hunan University traces its history back to the Yuelu Academy founded in 976 AD during the Song dynasty. Shuyuan was one form of private educational institution in China; another form was government-sponsored academies including imperial central school Taixue or Guozijian and regional schools. The Yuelu Academy was a venue for Chinese scholars and their students to meet and discuss sophisticated topics in Confucian Studies. The modern school was founded in 1897, initially called Shiwu Xuetang (时务学堂）and in 1903, called Hunan Institute of Higher Learning. The school name Hunan University was proposed in 1912, and in 1926, Hunan University was composed of three specialized public schools of Hunan. It was renamed Central-South Institute of Civil Engineering in 1937, and then, Hunan Polytechnic College. The name Hunan University was again adopted in 1949. The calligraphy of \"Yuelu Academy\" was written by Emperor Zhenzong of Song in 1015, and the calligraphy of \"Hunan University\" was written by Mao Zedong in 1950 as soon as the People's Republic of China was founded. For more than 1000 years, academic activities have been carrying on here. In the course of its development from Yuelu Academy to Hunan University, this long-established institution has cultivated a large number of outstanding scholars and has been honored as an \"Ancient Millenarian Academy, Famous Centennial University\". Additionally, Times Higher Education recognized Hunan University as \"China’s oldest higher education institution\".
