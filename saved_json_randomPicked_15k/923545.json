The Republic has also issued commemorative euro coins in other denominations, such as the 2014 €5 coin dedicated to three-time Formula One World Champion Ayrton Senna in 2014, being 20 years from Senna's fatal crash at the San Marino Grand Prix. This coin was also complemented by a commemorative €2.50 stamp. == Notes == ==See also== * San Marino–European Union relations ==References== ==External links== *The Euro Information Website – San Marino Category:Euro coins by issuing country Euro coins",
