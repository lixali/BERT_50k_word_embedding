 "text": "The Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC) is a college athletic conference which competes in NCAA Division III. All 13 of the member schools are located in Minnesota and are private institutions, with only two being non-sectarian. ==History== On March 15, 1920, a formal constitution was adopted and the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference with founding members Carleton College, Gustavus Adolphus College, Hamline University, Macalester College, Saint John's University, St. Olaf College, and the College of St. Thomas (now University of St. Thomas). Concordia College joined the MIAC in 1921, Augsburg University in 1924, and Saint Mary's University in 1926. Carleton dropped membership in 1925, rejoining in 1983. St. Olaf left in 1950, returning in 1975. The University of Minnesota Duluth was a member of the MIAC from 1950 to 1975. Bethel University joined in 1978. The MIAC initiated women's competition in the 1981–82 season. Two all-women's schools subsequently joined the conference, St. Catherine University in 1983 and the College of St. Benedict in 1985. The conference did not play sports from the fall 1943 to the spring of 1945 due to World War II. Saint Mary's discontinued its football program in 1955. Macalester football left the conference in 2002, but still retains its MIAC membership in other sports. St. Catherine and St. Benedict, being both women's colleges, also do not sponsor football. Together with Saint John's, one of only a handful of men's colleges, St. Benedict forms a joint academic institution, known commonly by the initialism CSB/SJU. From 1947 to 2003 the MIAC had a strong men's wrestling program, which was discontinued following the 2002–03 season. The strongest teams over the history of the conference were Augsburg with 31 team championships, and Saint John's with 14 team championships. The MIAC teams and individual wrestlers demonstrated a strong national and Olympic presence in the 1970s and beyond. On May 22, 2019, it was announced that the MIAC had expelled the University of St. Thomas effective at the end of spring 2021 at the latest, giving it time to make other athletic arrangements were that much time to become necessary. St. Thomas by this point had over twice the enrollment of any other member institution. and on May 28, 2020, the conference announced the addition of the College of St. Scholastica after leaving the Upper Midwest Athletic Conference in 2021. Starting in 2021 for football only the conference will divide into two divisions. The Northwoods Division will consist of Carleton College, Gustavus Adolphus College, Saint John's University, St. Olaf College, and The College of St. Scholastica. The Skyline Division will consist of Augsburg University, Bethel University, Concordia College, Hamline University, and Macalester College. ==Member schools== ===Current members=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !Institution !Nickname !Location (Minnesota) !Founded !Type !Undergrad enrollment !Colors !Joined |- | Augsburg University | Auggies | Minneapolis | 1869 | Private/Lutheran (ELCA) | 2,550 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | | 1924 |- | Bethel University | Royals | Arden Hills | 1871 | Private/Converge | 2,965 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | | 1977 |- | Carleton College | Knights | Northfield | 1866 | Private/Non-Sectarian | 2,105 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | | 1920, 1983 |- | Concordia College | Cobbers | Moorhead | 1891 | Private/Lutheran (ELCA) | 2,114 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | | 1921 |- | Gustavus Adolphus College | Golden Gusties | St. Peter | 1862 | Private/Lutheran (ELCA) | 2,230 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | | 1920 |- | Hamline University | Pipers | St. Paul | 1854 | Private/Methodist (UMC) | 2,184 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | | 1920 |- | Macalester College | Scots | St. Paul | 1874 | Private/Non-Sectarian | 2,146 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | | 1920 |- | | Bennies | St. Joseph | 1913 | Private/Catholic | 1,958 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | | 1985 |- | | Wildcats | St. Paul | 1905 | Private/Catholic | 3,176 | style=\"text- align:right;\" | | 1983 |- | | Johnnies | Collegeville | 1857 | Private/Catholic | 1,754 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | | 1920 |- | | Cardinals | Winona | 1912 | Private/Catholic | 1,590 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | | 1926 |- | | Oles | Northfield | 1874 | Private/Lutheran (ELCA) | 3,040 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | | 1920, 1975 |- | | Saints | Duluth | 1912 | Private/Catholic | 3,906 | style=\"text- align:right;\" | | 2021 |} ;Notes: ===Former members=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !Institution !Nickname !Location !Founded !Type !Enrollment !Joined !Left !Current conference |- | | Bulldogs | Duluth | 1902 | Public | 11,729 | 1951 | 1975 | NSIC |- | | Tommies | St. Paul | 1885 | Private/Catholic | 6,199 | 1920 | 2021 | Summit |} ===Membership timeline=== DateFormat = yyyy ImageSize = width:900 height:auto barincrement:20 Period = from:1920 till:2030 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal PlotArea = right:5 left:5 bottom:20 top:5 #> to display a count on left side of graph, use \"left:20\" to suppress the count, use \"left:0\"<# Legend = orientation:hor Colors = id:barcolor value:rgb(0.99,0.7,0.7) id:line value:black id:bg value:white id:Full value:rgb(0.742,0.727,0.852) legend:Full # Use this color to denote a team that is a member in all sports id:FullxF value:rgb(0.551,0.824,0.777) legend:Non-football # Use this color to denote a team that is a member in all sports except for football id:OtherC1 value:rgb(0.996,0.996,0.699) legend:WWII_(1943-45) # Use this color to denote a team that has moved to another conference id:AssocF value:rgb(0.98,0.5,0.445) legend:Football-only # Use this color to denote a team that is a member for football only id:AssocOS value:rgb(0.5,0.691,0.824) # Use this color to denote a team that is a member in some sports, but not all (consider identifying in legend or a footnote) id:OtherC2 value:rgb(0.988,0.703,0.383) # Use this color to denote a team that has moved to another conference where OtherC1 has already been used, to distinguish the two PlotData= width:15 textcolor:darkblue shift:(5,-5) anchor:from fontsize:s bar:1 color:Full from:1920 till:1925 text:Carleton (1920–1925) bar:1 color:Full from:1983 till:end text:(1983–present) bar:2 color:FullxF from:1920 till:1921 text:Gustavus Adolphus (1920–present) bar:2 color:Full from:1921 till:1941 bar:2 color:FullxF from:1941 till:1942 bar:2 color:Full from:1942 till:1943 bar:2 color:OtherC1 from:1943 till:1945 bar:2 color:Full from:1945 till:end bar:3 color:Full from:1920 till:end text:Hamline (1920–present) bar:3 color:OtherC1 from:1943 till:1945 bar:3 color:FullxF from:1945 till:1947 bar:3 color:Full from:1947 till:end bar:4 color:Full from:1920 till:1924 text:Macalester (1920–present) bar:4 color:FullxF from:1924 till:1926 bar:4 color:Full from:1926 till:1928 bar:4 color:FullxF from:1928 till:1929 bar:4 color:Full from:1929 till:1943 bar:4 color:OtherC1 from:1943 till:1945 bar:4 color:Full from:1945 till:2002 bar:4 color:FullxF from:2002 till:2014 bar:4 color:OtherC1 from:2014 till:2021 text:Midwest (fb. only) bar:4 color:Full from:2021 till:end bar:5 color:Full from:1920 till:1928 text:Saint John's (Minn.)
