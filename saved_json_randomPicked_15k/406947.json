 "text": "thumb|First and second Synchrotron functions. In mathematics the synchrotron functions are defined as follows (for x â‰¥ 0): * First synchrotron function :F(x) = x \\int_x^\\infty K_{\\frac{5}{3}}(t)\\,dt * Second synchrotron function :G(x) = x K_{\\frac{2}{3}}(x) where Kj is the modified Bessel function of the second kind. == Use in Astrophysics == In astrophysics, x is usually a ratio of frequencies, that is, the frequency over a critical frequency (critical frequency is the frequency at which most synchrotron radiation is radiated). This is needed when calculating the spectra for different types of synchrotron emission. It takes a spectrum of electrons (or any charged particle) generated by a separate process (such as a power law distribution of electrons and positrons from a constant injection spectrum) and converts this to the spectrum of photons generated by the input electrons/positrons.
