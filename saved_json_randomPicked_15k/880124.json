 "text": "150px|thumb|048 equals itself when transposed by 4 or 8 or when inverted In post-tonal music theory, identity is similar to identity in universal algebra. An identity function is a permutation or transformation which transforms a pitch or pitch class set into itself. Generally this requires symmetry. For instance, inverting an augmented triad or C4 interval cycle, 048, produces itself. Performing a retrograde operation upon the tone row 01210 produces 01210. Doubling the length of a rhythm while doubling the tempo produces a rhythm of the same durations as the original. In addition to being a property of a specific set, identity is, by extension, the \"family\" of sets or set forms which satisfy a possible identity. These families are defined by symmetry, which means that an object is invariant to any of various transformations; including reflection and rotation. George Perle provides the following example:Perle, George (1995). The Right Notes: Twenty-Three Selected Essays by George Perle on Twentieth-Century Music, p.237-238. . :\"C-E, D-F, E-G, are different instances of the same interval [interval-4]...[an] other kind of identity...has to do with axes of symmetry [reflection symmetry rather than interval families' rotational symmetry]. C-E belongs to a family [sum-4] of symmetrically related dyads as follows:\" {| | | |D | |C | |C | |B | |A | |A | |G |- | | |D | |D | |E | |F | |F | |G | |G |- | | |2 | |1 | |0 | |e | |9 | |8 | |7 |- | + | | _2_ | | _3_ | | _4_ | | _5_ | | _6_ | | _7_ | | _8_ |- | | |4 | |4 | |4 | |4 | |4 | |4 | |4 |} C=0, so in mod12, the interval-4 family: {| | | |C | |C | |D | |D | |E | |F | |F | |G | |G | |A | |A | |B |- | | |G | |A | |A | |B | |C | |C | |D | |D | |E | |F | |F | |G |- | | |0 | |1 | |2 | |3 | |4 | |5 | |6 | |7 | |8 | |9 | |t | |e |- | âˆ’ | | _8_ | | _9_ | | _10_ | | _11_ | | _0_ | | _1_ | | _2_ | | _3_ | | _4_ | | _5_ | | _6_ | | _7_ |- | | |4 | |4 | |4 | |4 | |4 | |4 | |4 | |4 | |4 | |4 | |4 | |4 |} Thus, in addition to being part of the sum-4 family, C-E is also a part of the interval-4 family (in contrast to sum families, interval families are based on difference). ==See also== *Klumpenhouwer network *Point reflection *Derived row *Twelve- tone technique#Invariance ==References== Category:Musical set theory",
