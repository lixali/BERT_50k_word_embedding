 "text": "Dialogues with Madwomen is a 1993 documentary by Allie Light focusing on mental illness in women. It was later aired on television on the PBS series POV. ==Synopsis== In Dialogues with Madwomen, filmmakers Allie Light and Irving Saraf have seven \"madwomen\" — including Light herself — into telling their stories. Using a mixture of home movies, archival footage of psychiatric wards, re-enactments, and interviews with their subjects, Light and Saraf have created a complex, moving portrait of women in whom depression, schizophrenia, and multiple personalities coexist with powerful, sometimes inspired levels of creativity. ==See also== *Atypical antipsychotics, which came onto the market after this film was made ==Karen Wong== In December 2013, a man whose DNA linked him to Karen Wong, one of the seven women in the film, was found guilty and convicted for her murder.
