A later controversy developed over the titling of the season's sixth episode as \"Hot Ghetto Mess\" involving Brown's attempt to make sure one of the films did not partake in racial stereotypes, which was to be corrected before airing and replaced with \"The Pivot\", but was never resolved before airtime. ==Awards and nominations== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" width=100% |- ! scope=\"col\" width=\"5%\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" width=\"15%\" | Award ! scope=\"col\" width=\"15%\" | Category ! scope=\"col\" width=\"50%\" | Nominee(s) ! scope=\"col\" width=\"10%\" | Result ! scope=\"col\" width=\"5%\" | Ref. |- | 2002 | Primetime Emmy Award | Outstanding Non-Fiction Program (Reality) | Ben Affleck, Sean Bailey, Liz Bronstein, Billy Campbell, Matt Damon, Tina Gazzerro, Eli Holzman, Chris Moore, Harvey Weinstein, Bob Weinstein, Tony Yates | | |- | 2004 | Primetime Emmy Award | Outstanding Reality Program | Ben Affleck, Sean Bailey, Dan Cutforth, Matt Damon, Eli Holzman, Jane Lipsitz, Chris Moore, Bob Osher, Randy Sacks, Harvey Weinstein, Bob Weinstein, Tony Yates | | |- | 2005 | Primetime Emmy Award | Outstanding Reality Program | Ben Affleck, Sean Bailey, Jennifer Berman, Frances Berwick, Rich Buhrman, Andrew Cohen, Dan Cutforth, Matt Damon, Gayle Gawlowski, Eli Holzman, Marc Joubert, Casey Kriley, Jane Lipsitz, Alexandra Lipsitz, Chris Moore, Kevin Morra, Bob Osher, Barbara Schneeweiss, David Serwatka, Larry Tanz, Harvey Weinstein, Bob Weinstein | | |- | 2016 | Primetime Emmy Award | Outstanding Unstructured Reality Program | Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Jane Lipsitz, Dan Cutforth, TJ Barrack, Perrin Chiles, Marc Joubert, Marshall Lewy, Alexandra Lipsitz and Gaylen Gawlowski | | |- |} ==Australia== ===Series 1=== In 2005, Project Greenlight Australia was launched with Pay-TV Movie Network in partnership with Screentime producing the show and offering the A$1,000,000 financing to the winning film. The entries were received online with last entries being accepted on February 14. The screenplay selected from the 1200 submissions was Solo by Morgan O'Neill. ===Series 2=== In 2006, comedian and filmmaker Paul McDermott hosted the series. The screenplay selected from the 700 submissions was The View from Greenhaven by The MacRae Brothers. ==Notes== The episode \"The Pivot\" was originally titled \"Hot Ghetto Mess.\" However, the scene contextualizing the title was removed in last-minute editing. The original title was not corrected for television listings before air due to what was described as a \"production error\" by HBO. Future airings, along with HBO Go/HBO Now use \"The Pivot\" as the episode's title. ==References== ==External links== * at HBO * Category:2000s American documentary television series Category:2010s American documentary television series Category:2001 American television series debuts Category:2015 American television series endings Category:HBO original programming Category:HBO Max original programming Category:Television series by Miramax Television Category:Bravo (American TV network) original programming Category:English-language television shows Category:American television series revived after cancellation Category:Television series about filmmaking Category:Hoorae Media",
