 "text": "FPS (full name: Forssan Palloseura) is a Finnish ice hockey team based in Forssa Ice Hall (capacity 3000), Forssa, established in 1931. Forssan Palloseura has two lower level teams: FoPS which plays in lower divisions and FoPS Flames which plays in the 2. Divisioona league. FoPS Flames gained some negative news after former SM-liiga and Forssan Palloseura defenceman Timo Willman assaulted an opposing player during a 3rd Division game in 2007. Most famous FPS figures are former NHL-coach Alpo Suhonen and player Mika Helkearo who are nicknamed the \"Divarin Gretzky\" (Gretzky of the 1st Division) from his virtually unbreakable Mestis records in games, assists and points.
