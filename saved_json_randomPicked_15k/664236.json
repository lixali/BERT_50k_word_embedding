 "text": "The Bridgeport Islanders (previously known as the Bridgeport Sound Tigers) are a professional ice hockey team playing in the American Hockey League (AHL). They are the AHL affiliate of the National Hockey League's New York Islanders, who own the franchise. The team started in 2001–02 season and were purchased by the Islanders in 2004. The team is based in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and play their home games at the Total Mortgage Arena. ==History== thumb|150px|left|alt=The Bridgeport Sound Tigers logo, used from 2001 to 2021|The Bridgeport Sound Tigers logo, used from 2001 to 2021 The Bridgeport Sound Tigers joined the American Hockey League as an expansion franchise in 2001 and were coached by Steve Stirling. In their inaugural season, the team won their division and had the best regular season record to win the Macgregor Kilpatrick Trophy. In the playoffs, they won Eastern Conference championship and the Richard F. Canning Trophy to advance to the Calder Cup finals against the Chicago Wolves. They lost the series four games-to-one. In their second season, the team finished second in their division and the fifth conference seed in the playoffs. They advanced to the conference semifinals where they lost to their division champion Binghamton Senators in six games. Stirling was promoted to head coaching position with the New York Islanders and was replaced by Greg Cronin for 2003–04. As the Sound Tigers, the team then had limited success, missing the playoffs ten times and not winning a playoff round since their second season. On May 10, 2021, it was announced that the team would change its name to the Bridgeport Islanders beginning with the 2021–22 season. ==Team identity== ===Mascot=== The lone mascot of the Sound Tigers was an anthropomorphic blue tiger named Storm. He appeared at home games sporting a jersey with the number 01. While Storm can usually be found exciting fans throughout the arena, he skates on the ice during periodic intermissions. Storm's appearance has changed since the team's inaugural season. With the Sound Tigers' rebrand to the Islanders, it is unclear whether Storm will remain as the team's mascot. ===Rivalries=== The main (and instate) rival of the Islanders are the Hartford Wolf Pack, the AHL affiliate of the New York Rangers (the main rival of the Bridgeport Islanders' parent club, the New York Islanders). The games have become known as the Battle of Connecticut. They have formed a rivalry with the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, the Pittsburgh Penguins' AHL affiliate, largely due to the two teams frequently facing off in playoff match-ups. They also are semi-rivals with the Hershey Bears, the Washington Capitals' AHL affiliate. ==Season-by-season results== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !colspan=12|Regular season !colspan=5|Playoffs |- !Season !Games !Won !Lost !Tied !OTL !SOL !Points !PCT !Goals for !Goals against !Standing !Year !1st round !2nd round !3rd round !Finals |- |2001–02 || 80 || 43 || 25 || 8 || 4 ||—|| 98 || .613 || 240 || 192 || 1st, East || 2002 || W, 3–1, MAN || W, 4–0 SJM || W, 4–3, HAM || L, 1–4, CHI |- |2002–03 || 80 || 40 || 26 || 11 || 3 ||—|| 94 || .588 || 219 || 198 || 2nd, East || 2003 || W, 3–0, MAN || L, 2–4, BNG ||—||— |- |2003–04 || 80 || 41 || 23 || 12 || 4 ||—|| 98 || .613 || 178 || 140 || 2nd, East || 2004 || L, 3–4, WBS ||—||—||— |- |2004–05 || 80 || 37 || 38 ||—|| 1 || 4 || 79 || .494 || 192 || 222 || 6th, East || 2005 ||colspan=\"4\"|Did not qualify |- |2005–06 || 80 || 38 || 33 ||—|| 6 || 3 || 85 || .531 || 246 || 253 || 4th, East || 2006 || L, 3–4, WBS ||—||—||— |- |2006–07 || 80 || 36 || 37 ||—|| 1 || 6 || 79 || .494 || 229 || 267 || 5th, East || 2007 ||colspan=\"4\"|Did not qualify |- |2007–08 || 80 || 40 || 36 ||—|| 1 || 3 || 84 || .525 || 225 || 240 || 5th, East || 2008 ||colspan=\"4\"|Did not qualify |- |2008–09 || 80 || 49 || 23 ||—|| 3 || 5 || 106 || .663 || 241 || 212 || 2nd, East || 2009 || L, 1–4, WBS ||—||—||— |- |2009–10 || 80 || 38 || 32 ||—|| 4 || 6 || 86 || .538 || 201 || 220 || 5th, Atlantic || 2010 || L, 1–4, HER ||—||—||— |- |2010–11 || 80 || 30 || 39 ||—|| 4 || 7 || 67 || .444 || 209 || 256 || 7th, Atlantic || 2011 ||colspan=\"4\"|Did not qualify |- |2011–12 || 76 || 41 || 26 ||—|| 3 || 6 || 91 || .599 || 233 || 219 || 1st, Northeast || 2012 || L, 0–3, CON ||—||—||— |- |2012–13 || 76 || 32 || 32 ||—|| 7 || 5 || 76 || .449 || 218 || 242 || 3rd, Northeast || 2013 ||colspan=\"4\"|Did not qualify |- |2013–14 || 76 || 28 || 40 ||—|| 2 || 6 || 64 || .421 || 183 || 238 || 5th, Northeast || 2014 ||colspan=\"4\"|Did not qualify |- |2014–15 || 76 || 28 || 40 ||—|| 7 || 1 || 64 || .421 || 213 || 246 || 5th, Northeast || 2015 ||colspan=\"4\"|Did not qualify |- |2015–16 || 76 || 40 || 29 ||—|| 4 || 3 || 87 || .572 || 209 || 220 || 5th, Atlantic || 2016 || L, 0–3, TOR ||—||—||— |- |2016–17 || 76 || 44 || 28 ||—|| 3 || 1 || 92 || .605 || 220 || 212 || 5th, Atlantic || 2017 ||colspan=\"4\"|Did not qualify |- |2017–18 || 76 || 36 || 32 ||—|| 5 || 3 || 80 || .526 || 206 || 214 || 5th, Atlantic || 2018 ||colspan=\"4\"|Did not qualify |- |2018–19 || 76 || 43 || 24 ||—|| 6 || 3 || 95 || .625 || 233 || 228 || 2nd, Atlantic || 2019 || L, 2–3, HER || — || — || — |- |2019–20 || 63 || 23 || 33 || — || 5 || 2 || 53 || .421 || 152 || 206 || 8th, Atlantic || 2020 ||colspan=\"4\"|Season cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic |- |2020–21 || 24 || 8 || 14 || — || 2 || 0 || 18 || .375 || 59 || 81 || 3rd, Atlantic || 2021 ||colspan=\"4\"|No playoffs were held |} ==Players== ===Current roster=== Updated March 28, 2022. |} ===Team captains=== ;Notes * There were three captains for the 2004–05 season: Aldridge named on Oct. 16, 2004, Seeley named on Nov. 6, 2004, and Campbell named on Mar. 16, 2005 * There were two captains for the 2012–13 season: McDonald named on Dec. 7, 2012, and Watkins named on Feb. 22, 2013. * There were two captains: when Ben Holmstrom played, he wore the \"C\" on his sweater.
