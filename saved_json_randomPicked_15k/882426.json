The United States District Court for the District of New York was the first District Court ever convened under the sovereignty of the United States, with Judge James Duane presiding on November 3, 1789. The Northern District was split again in 1900, giving rise to the United States District Court for the Western District of New York. The first judge in the Northern District of New York was Matthias Burnett Tallmadge. The district now covers thirty-two counties in upstate New York, with an extensive border with Canada to the north. == Current judges == : == Vacancies and pending nominations == {| class=wikitable !
