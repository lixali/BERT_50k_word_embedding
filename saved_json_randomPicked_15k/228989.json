 "text": "On Every Street is the sixth and final studio album by British rock band Dire Straits, released on 9 September 1991 by Vertigo Records internationally, and by Warner Bros. Records in the United States. The follow-up to the band's massively successful album Brothers in Arms, On Every Street reached the top of the UK Albums Chart and was also certified platinum by the RIAA. ==History== On Every Street was released more than six years after the band's previous album, Brothers in Arms, and was Dire Straits' final studio album. It reached number 12 in the United States and number one in the United Kingdom and numerous European countries. The album was produced by Mark Knopfler and Dire Straits. By this time, the band comprised Knopfler, John Illsley, Alan Clark and Guy Fletcher, and the album features session musicians including Paul Franklin, Phil Palmer, Danny Cummings and American drummer Jeff Porcaro from Toto. Dire Straits promoted the album with a world tour which lasted until the end of 1992. The group disbanded in 1995, after which Mark Knopfler pursued a solo career. The album was remastered and reissued with the rest of the Dire Straits catalogue in 1996 for most of the world, except for the United States, where it was reissued on 19 September 2000. ==Track listing== The album was released on LP, compact cassette, Digital Compact Cassette and CD. The track list below corresponds to the original LP and cassette variants. The LP version is notable to have the same duration as the CD and cassette versions, being more than one hour long. This was achieved by narrowing the grooves, which reduced the sound level. The 2014 pressing of the album comes on two LPs having three songs per side. All songs written by Mark Knopfler. ^Certain versions of the album feature a slightly longer version of \"Heavy Fuel\" (length of 5:10), which includes approximately four measures of additional instrumental music both between the first chorus and second verse, and between the bridge and the third verse.Dire Straits - Heavy Fuel @YouTube (song doesn't actually begin until about two seconds in on this video, so subtracted two seconds to get song length of 5:10). Retrieved August 14, 2021. It is unclear if the 5:10 version is the original \"uncut\" version or if these instrumental passages were simply added afterward to extend the song. == Personnel == Dire Straits * Mark Knopfler – vocals, guitars * Alan Clark – keyboards, string conductor (9) * Guy Fletcher – keyboards, backing vocals * John Illsley – bass Additional musicians * Phil Palmer – guitars * Vince Gill – guitar (5), backing vocals (5) * Paul Franklin – pedal steel guitar, acoustic lap steel guitar (6) * Jeff Porcaro – drums, percussion * Manu Katché – drums (7, 11), percussion (7, 11) * Danny Cummings – percussion * Chris White – flute, saxophones * George Martin – string arrangements (9), string conductor (9) == Production == * Mark Knopfler – producer * Dire Straits – producers * Chuck Ainlay – engineer * Bill Schnee – engineer * Steve Orchard – assistant engineer * Jack Joseph Puig – assistant engineer * Andy Strange – assistant engineer * Neil Dorfsman – mixing (1-6, 8-11) * Bob Clearmountain – mixing (7) * Avril Mackintosh – mix assistant * Bob Ludwig – mastering at Masterdisk (New York City, New York) * Jo Motta – project coordinator * Sutton Cooper – design * Paul Cummins – design * Paul Williams – sleeve photography ==Singles== On Every Street produced six singles: # \"Calling Elvis\" # \"Heavy Fuel\" # \"On Every Street\" # \"The Bug\" # \"You and Your Friend\" (released in France and Germany) # \"Ticket to Heaven\" (released in The Netherlands) ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !Chart (1991) !Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Portuguese Albums (AFP)Music & Media, vol. 8, issue 41; Oct 19, 1991 |style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !Chart (1991) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australian Albums (ARIA) |align=\"center\"|25 |- !scope=\"row\"|Austrian Albums (Ö3 Austria) |align=\"center\"|15 |- !scope=\"row\"|Dutch Albums (Album Top 100) |align=\"center\"|1 |- !scope=\"row\"|German Albums (Offizielle Top 100) |align=\"center\"|12 |- !scope=\"row\"|New Zealand Albums (RMNZ) |align=\"center\"|26 |- !scope=\"row\"|Swiss Albums (Schweizer Hitparade) |align=\"center\"|36 |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !Chart (1992) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Dutch Albums (Album Top 100) |align=\"center\"|34 |- !scope=\"row\"|German Albums (Offizielle Top 100) |align=\"center\"|39 |} ===Singles charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! style=\"width:50px;\" |Year ! style=\"width:150px;\" |Song ! style=\"width:50px;\" |UK ! style=\"width:50px;\" |AUS ! style=\"width:50px;\" |AUT ! style=\"width:50px;\" |FRA ! style=\"width:50px;\" |ITA ! style=\"width:50px;\" |NLD ! style=\"width:50px;\" |NOR ! style=\"width:50px;\" |SWE ! style=\"width:50px;\" |SWI ! style=\"width:50px;\" |US Alt. ! style=\"width:50px;\" |US Main.
