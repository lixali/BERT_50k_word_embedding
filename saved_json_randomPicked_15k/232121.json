 "text": "thumb|Namboku Line The Namboku Line (南北線 Namboku-sen) is one of two lines owned by the Kobe Rapid Transit Railway (0.4 km). It is operated by Kobe Electric Railway and has only two stations. This short stretch of track, opened in 1968 is important as it connects the Kobe Electric Railway to Shinkaichi, allowing Shintetsu passengers to transfer directly to Hankyū and Hanshin trains bound for Kobe Sannomiya and Umeda (Osaka), and Sanyo line trains bound for Himeji. As it is only used by Shintetsu rolling stock, the line is narrow gauge. ==List of stations on the Namboku Line== ==References== This article incorporates material from the corresponding article in the Japanese Wikipedia Category:Railway lines in Japan Category:Transport in Kobe",
