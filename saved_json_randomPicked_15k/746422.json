 "text": "thumb|right|Mustard oil and the seeds it is derived from Mustard oil can mean either the pressed oil used for cooking, or a pungent essential oil also known as volatile oil of mustard. The essential oil results from grinding mustard seed, mixing the grounds with water, and extracting the resulting volatile oil by distillation. It can also be produced by dry distillation of the seed. Pressed mustard oil is used as cooking oil in some cultures, but sale is restricted in some countries due to high levels of erucic acid. Varieties of mustard seed also exist that are low in erucic acid. ==Pressed oil== thumb|right|Ox-powered mill grinding mustard seed for oil This oil has a distinctive pungent taste, characteristic of all plants in the mustard family, Brassicaceae (for example, cabbage, cauliflower, turnip, radish, horseradish, or wasabi). It is often used for cooking in India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. In Bengal, Odisha, Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, and Nepal, it is the traditionally preferred oil for cooking. The oil makes up about 30% of the mustard seeds. It can be produced from black mustard (Brassica nigra), brown Indian mustard (B. juncea), and white mustard (B. hirta). The characteristic pungent flavour of mustard oil is due to allyl isothiocyanate. Mustard oil has about 60% monounsaturated fatty acids (42% erucic acid and 12% oleic acid); it has about 21% polyunsaturated fats (6% the omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid and 15% the omega-6 linoleic acid), and it has about 12% saturated fats.Entry for mustard oil in the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 22 ===Potential toxicity=== Mustard oil has high levels of erucic acid. Erucic acid may have toxic effects on the heart at high doses.Food Standards Australia New Zealand (June 2003) Erucic acid in food : A Toxicological Review and Risk Assessment .

In High and Low Erucic Acid Rapeseed Oils. Elsevier. p. 560. An association between the consumption of dietary erucic acid and increased myocardial lipidosis, or heart disease, has not been established for humans, although given what is known about erucic acid, it is reasonable to expect that humans would be susceptible to this.Food Standards Australia New Zealand (June 2003) Erucic acid in food: A Toxicological Review and Risk Assessment Technical report series No. 21; Page 4 paragraph 1; , ISSN 1448-3017 Mustard oil is not allowed to be imported or sold in the U.S. for use in cooking, except for those products with exceptionally low erucic acid content.FDA, 18 March 2011 FDA Import Alert 26-04 ===Nutritional information=== According to the USDA, 100 grams of mustard oil contains 884 calories of food energy, and is 100% fat. The fat composition is 11% saturated fat, 59% monounsaturated fat, and 21% polyunsaturated fat.Food Composition Databases Show Foods -- Oil, mustard (Retrieved 2017-12-11) ==Essential oil== The pungency of the condiment mustard results when ground mustard seeds are mixed with water, vinegar, or other liquid (or even when chewed). Under these conditions, a chemical reaction between the enzyme myrosinase and a glucosinolate known as sinigrin from the seeds of black mustard (Brassica nigra) or brown Indian mustard (Brassica juncea) produces allyl isothiocyanate. By distillation one can produce a very sharp-tasting essential oil, sometimes called volatile oil of mustard, containing more than 92% allyl isothiocyanate. The pungency of allyl isothiocyanate is due to the activation of the TRPA1 ion channel in sensory neurons. White mustard (Brassica hirta) does not yield allyl isothiocyanate, but a different and milder isothiocyanate. Allyl isothiocyanate serves the plant as a defense against herbivores. Since it is harmful to the plant itself, it is stored in the harmless form of a glucosinolate, separate from the enzyme myrosinase. Once the herbivore chews the plant, the noxious allyl isothiocyanate is produced. Allyl isothiocyanate is also responsible for the pungent taste of horseradish and wasabi. It can be produced synthetically, sometimes known as synthetic mustard oil. ==See also== * List of mustard brands *Mustard plant *Mustard seed *Mustard (condiment) *Brassica species *Brassica nigra *Brassica juncea *White mustard *Rapeseed *Canola *Brassicaceae *Myrosinase *thioglycoside *Glucoside *Glucosinolate *Sinigrin *Sinalbin *Isothiocyanate *Allyl isothiocyanate *Bengali cuisine *Odia cuisine *Oil cake ==References== Category:Cooking oils Category:Vegetable oils Category:Essential oils",
