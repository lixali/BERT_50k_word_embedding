 "text": "The 1st millennium BC, also known as the last millennium BC, was the period of time lasting from the years 1000 BC to 1 BC (10th to 1st centuries BC; in astronomy: JD – Julian Day Number from Date Calculator (casio.com)). It encompasses the Iron Age in the Old World and sees the transition from the Ancient Near East to classical antiquity. World population roughly doubled over the course of the millennium, from about 100 million to about 200–250 million.Klein Goldewijk, K. , A. Beusen, M. de Vos and G. van Drecht (2011). The HYDE 3.1 spatially explicit database of human induced land use change over the past 12,000 years, Global Ecology and Biogeography20(1): 73–86. (pbl.nl). Goldewijk et al. (2011) estimate 188 million as of AD 1, citing a literature range of 170 million (low) to 300 million (high). Out of the estimated 188M, 116M are estimated for Asia (East, South/Southeast and Central Asia, excluding Western Asia), 44M for Europe and the Near East, 15M for Africa (including Egypt and Roman North Africa), 12M for Mesoamerica and South America. North America and Oceania were at or below one million.. Jean-Noël Biraben, \"Essai sur l'évolution du nombre des hommes\", Population 34-1 (1979), 13–25 (p. 22) estimats c. 100 million at 1200 BC and c. 250 million at AD 1. ==The world in the 1st millennium BC== thumb|550px|centre|Map of the Eastern Hemisphere in 1000 BC. thumb|550px|centre|Map of the world in 1 AD, just after the end of the 1st millennium BC. ==Overview== The Neo-Assyrian Empire dominates the Near East in the early centuries of the millennium, supplanted by the Achaemenid Empire in the 6th century. Ancient Egypt is in decline, and falls to the Achaemenids in 525 BC. In Greece, Classical Antiquity begins with the colonization of Magna Graecia and peaks with the conquest of the Achaemenids and the subsequent flourishing of Hellenistic civilization (4th to 2nd centuries). The Roman Republic supplants the Etruscans and then the Carthaginians (5th to 3rd centuries). The close of the millennium sees the rise of the Roman Empire. The early Celts dominate Central Europe while Northern Europe is in the Pre-Roman Iron Age. In East Africa, the Nubian Empire and Aksum arise. In South Asia, the Vedic civilization blends into the Maurya Empire. The Scythians dominate Central Asia. In China, the Spring and Autumn period sees the rise of Confucianism. Towards the close of the millennium, the Han Dynasty extends Chinese power towards Central Asia, where it borders on Indo-Greek and Iranian states. Japan is in the Yayoi period. The Maya civilization rises in Mesoamerica. The first millennium BC is the formative period of the classical world religions, with the development of early Judaism and Zoroastrianism in the Near East, and Vedic religion and Vedanta, Jainism and Buddhism in India. Early literature develops in Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Sanskrit, Tamil and Chinese. The term Axial Age, coined by Karl Jaspers, is intended to express the crucial importance of the period of c. the 8th to 2nd centuries BC in world history. World population more than doubled over the course of the millennium, from about an estimated 50–100 million to an estimated 170–300 million. Close to 90% of world population at the end of the first millennium BC lived in the Iron Age civilizations of the Old World (Roman Empire, Parthian Empire, Graeco-Indo-Scythian and Hindu kingdoms, Han China). The population of the Americas was below 20 million, concentrated in Mesoamerica (Epi-Olmec culture); that of Sub-Saharan Africa was likely below 10 million. The population of Oceania was likely less than one million people. ==Ancient history== ===Timeline=== *10th century BC **Near East: Neo-Assyrian Empire **Near East: Shoshenq I invades Canaan **Aegean: Helladic period ends *9th century BC **Egypt: 872 BC: Nile floods the Temple of Luxor **Egypt: 836 BC: Civil war in Egypt ** North Africa: 814 BC: Carthage founded **China: 841 BC–828 BC Gonghe Regency *8th century BC **727 BC: Egypt: Kushite invasion (25th dynasty) **771 BC: China: Spring and Autumn period **Near East: 727 BC: Death of Tiglath-Pileser III, Babylonia secedes from Assyria **Near East: 722 BC: Sargon II takes Samaria; Assyrian captivity of the Israelites. **Greece: Archaic Greece, Greek alphabet **Greece: Homer **776 BC: Greece: First Olympiad **753 BC: Europe: foundation of Rome *7th century BC **671 BC: Assyrian conquest of Egypt **Near East: 631 BC: Death of Ashurbanipal, decline of the Assyrian Empire *6th century BC **Egypt: 592 BC: Psamtik II sacks Napata **Sudan: Aspelta moves the Kushite capital to Meroe **Near East: 539 BC: Achaemenid conquest of Babylon under Cyrus the Great **South Asia: Śramaṇa movement and \"second urbanisation\" **South Asia: Early Buddhism **Europe: 509 BC: Roman Republic *5th century BC **China: 479 BC: death of Confucius **China: 476 BC: Warring States period **China: 486 BC: Grand Canal construction begins **Near East: Second Temple Judaism, redaction of the Hebrew Bible ** Greece: beginning of the classical period (Greece in the 5th century BC). ** Greece: Greco-Persian Wars (Battle of Marathon, Battle of Thermopylae) ** Greece: 440 BC: Herodotus' Histories ** Greece: 431 BC: Peloponnesian War **Oceania: Austronesian expansion reaches Western Polynesia *4th century BC **Greece: 395 BC: Corinthian War **Egypt: 343 BC: Achaemenid conquest **Greece/Asia/Egypt: 330s BC: conquests of Alexander the Great, end of the Achaemenid Empire, Macedonian Empire, beginning of the Hellenistic period **South Asia: Mauryan Empire *3rd century BC **China: Qin Unified China **China: 206 BC: Han Dynasty **South Asia: 261 BC: Kalinga war **Rome: Roman expansion in Italy **Rome/Carthage: Punic Wars *** 264 BC: First Punic War *** 218 BC Second Punic War *2nd century BC **Rome/Carthage: 149 BC Third Punic War, Roman province of Africa **Rome/Greece: 146 BC Battle of Corinth, beginning of the Roman era **South Asia: 185 BC: Fall of the Maurya Empire **China: Confucianism became the state ideology of China *1st century BC **China: 91 BC: Records of the Grand Historian finished **Rome/Europe: 58–50 BC Gallic Wars **Rome: 32/30 BC: Final War of the Roman Republic (Battle of Actium) **Rome/Egypt: 31 BC: Roman conquest of Egypt **Rome/Europe/West Asia/Africa: 27 BC: Roman Empire ===Inventions, discoveries, introductions=== *8th century BC ** Greek alphabet, the first alphabet with vowels. *7th century BC **Trireme *6th century BC **paved trackway ** Pythagorean theorem **MonotheismAlthough disputed, some scholars see the emergence of monotheism proper in the context of the Babylonian exile, during which the Israelites adopted aspects of Babylonian religion, resulting in Second Temple Judaism by 515 BC.
