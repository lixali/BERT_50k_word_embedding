 "text": "== Mathematics and physics == * In theoretical physics, a matrix model is a system (usually a quantum mechanical system) with matrix-valued physical quantities. See, for example, Lax pair. * The \"old\" matrix models are relevant for string theory in two spacetime dimensions. The \"new\" matrix model is a synonym for \"matrix theory.\" * A concept from algebraic logic. == Biomedicine == * Matrix population models are used to model wildlife and human population dynamics. * The Matrix Model of substance abuse treatment is a model developed by the Matrix Institute on Addictions in the 1980s to treat cocaine and methamphetamine addiction. * Protein complexes: a matrix model of protein complexes (unrealistically) predicts that all proteins in a complex interact with all other proteins. Mathematically, a matrix model of a protein complex is a complete graph. == Management and economics == * The term \"matrix model\" is used to describe matrix management where each worker in an organisation has two managers, one \"functional\": managing their expertise, the other \"executive\": managing their work on a project.
