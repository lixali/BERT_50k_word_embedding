Features of the Pokémon mini include an internal real-time clock, an infrared port used to facilitate multiplayer gaming, a reed switch for detecting shakes, and a motor used to implement force feedback. Pokémon Channel features playable emulated demo versions of Pokémon Mini games, including the console exclusive \"Snorlax's Lunch Time\". Games such as \"Togepi's Adventure\" were only released in Japan.
