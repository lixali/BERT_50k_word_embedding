Kyushu Institute of Technology, 2013. The term \"Kunado-no-Kami\" and its variants are derived ultimately from ku-na-do, meaning a place that is not to be entered, a taboo or sacred space.日本人名大辞典+Plus『来名戸之祖神』。 These kami are regarded as protecting the boundaries of a village and forestalling entry by malicious or harmful spirits and influences, thereby preventing disasters. A common origin myth connects them with the fundoshi cast aside by Izanagi upon his return from the underworld as recorded in the Kojiki.大辞泉『道祖神』。 In some cases the protection of these kami extends to roads and paths, in which capacity the variant name Chimata-no-Kami is particularly likely to be applied. ==See also== * Mishaguji ==References== Category:Japanese gods Category:Shinto kami",
