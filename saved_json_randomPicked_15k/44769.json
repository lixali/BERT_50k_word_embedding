Carpigiani produced and patented a gelato machine, named \"Autogelatiera\". The Carpigiani soft serve ice cream machines make a fluffy, whippy ice cream due to their clever whipping action, mixing air and ice cream mix, during the ice cream making process. The technological growth in the 1960s brought Carpigiani to become the worldwide leader in ice cream machinery, with the invention of the \"hard-o-matic\". In 1964 an American secondary company was founded with the name Coldelite U.S.A. and in 1971 Carpigiani bought Cattabriga (concurrent firm). In 1989 the Comenda Ali S.p.A. group bought the Carpigiani Bruto S.p.A., now become Carpigiani Group - Ali Group S.r.l. In 1993 Carpagiani was certified UNI EN ISO 9001:1987. It was the first company in the business to receive this certification. The company has branches in France, Germany, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, United States, Japan, China, Singapore, Russia and two in South America. Production plants are located in Bologna, including the headquarters in Anzola dell'Emilia, in Forl√¨, in Gandia and in Zhongshan. In the 1990s, the Swiss Ott-Freezer, the Promag of Milan, the Spanish Sencotel and the Italian GBG were acquired.
