 "text": "CFRX is the international shortwave relay of CFRB, a news/talk station in Toronto, Ontario. It transmits with a power of 1 kW on 6.07 MHz in the 49-meter shortwave band. CFRX signed on the air on February 11, 1937, 10 years after CFRB began. The shortwave signal was originally directed to the northwest in order to provide service towards northern Ontario and western Canada. When a new transmitter was installed in the 2000s, it was made non- directional with the intention of providing availability to Canadians travelling to or vacationing in the United States, particularly snowbirds.History of CFRX-SW History of CFRX; retrieved August 2, 2018. ==References== ==External links== * Newstalk 1010 * Another official CFRX website * History of CFRX-SW - Canadian Communications Foundation FRX Category:Radio stations established in 1937 Category:Canadian diaspora in North America",
