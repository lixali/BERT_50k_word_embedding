 "text": "is a Japanese semiconductor manufacturer headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, initially incorporated in 2002 as Renesas Technology, the consolidated entity of the semiconductor units of Hitachi and Mitsubishi excluding their dynamic random-access memory businesses, to which NEC Electronics merged in 2010, resulting in a minor change in the corporate name and logo to as it is now. In the 2000s to early 2010s, Renesas had been one of the six largest semiconductor companies in the world. As of 2014, it was the world's largest automotive semiconductor maker, and the world's largest maker of microcontrollers. The company also has presences in the markets of analogue and mixed-signal integrated circuits, memory devices, and SoCs. The brand Renesas is a contraction of \"Renaissance Semiconductor for Advanced Solutions\". == History == Renesas Electronics started operation in April 2010, through the integration of NEC Electronics, established in November 2002 as a spin-off of the semiconductor operations of NEC with the exception of the DRAM business, and Renesas Technology established on April 1, 2003, the non-DRAM chip joint venture of Hitachi and Mitsubishi, with their ownership percentage of 55 and 45 in order. The DRAM businesses of the three had become part of Elpida Memory, which went bankrupt in 2012 before being acquired by Micron Technology. A basic agreement to merge was reached by April 2010 and materialized on the first day, forming the fourth largest semiconductor company by revenue according to an estimation from iSuppli. In December 2010, Renesas Mobile Corporation (RMC) was created by integrating the Mobile Multimedia Business Unit of Renesas with the acquired Nokia Wireless Modem Business Unit. In 2011, Renesas Electronics was adversely affected by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami“Quake-hit Renesas plant restarts production” June 5, 2011 The Daily Yomiuri and flooding in Thailand. In 2012, the company, which had about 50 thousand employees of manufacturing, design and sales operations in about 20 countries in 2011, decided to restructure its business, including the sale and consolidation of its Japanese domestic plants, to become profitable. In December 2012, INCJ, a Japanese public-private fund, and several key clients decided to invest in the company. Through the investment, Renesas aimed to secure 150 billion yen as fresh capital by September 2013 and make use of it for investment in development of the microcontroller and analog and power chips for automotive and industrial uses, plant improvements, and corporate acquisitions. In January 2013, Renesas transferred some of its back- end plants to J-Devices. In September 2013, Broadcom acquired most of Renesas Mobile Communication. With the allotment of third-party shares to the nine investors completed in September 2013, INCJ became the largest shareholder in the company. Renesas announced its new business direction and issued its corporate presentation titled \"Reforming Renesas” in October 2013. In the fiscal year ended in March 2014, Renesas recorded its first ever net profit since it started operation as Renesas Electronics Corporation in 2010. In July 2014, the subsidiary Renesas Mobile Communication was consolidated, after the company had decided to withdraw from the 4G wireless business. In September 2014, the sale of the display driver IC unit of Renesas to Synaptics was completed. In September 2016, Renesas announced that it would acquire Intersil for $3.2 billion. In February 2017, Renesas completed the acquisition. In April 2017, Renesas unveiled a self-driving concept car at a global developer conference, stating that it will start delivering a new line of products for self-driving cars in December 2017, as it takes on global giants such as Intel. The new technology acts as an onboard nerve center, coordinating and controlling vehicle functions.Hans Greimel, Automotive News. “Renesas takes on global giants in growing autonomous vehicle market.” June 19, 2017. June 23, 2017. In September 2018, Renesas announced that it has agreed to buy Integrated Device Technology for $6.7 billion. The acquisition was completed in March 2019. In 2020, Renesas announced its plans to wind down its production of diodes and the compound device. In February 2021, Renesas announced that it has agreed to buy Dialog Semiconductor for $5.9 billion. The acquisition was completed in September 2021. In March 2021, a fire at a factory owned by a subsidiary of Renesas caused significant damage to equipment. Renesas said that it would take at least a month to restart the damaged operations. == Products == The offerings of Renesas Electronics include: *Microcontrollers: RL78, RA, RX, Synergy, RE R8C, H8, 78K, *Microprocessors: SuperH, R32C / M32C/ M16C, V850, M32R,RH850 etc. and the RZ family built on the ARM architectureNew RZ Family Debuts: Powerful processors built around an Arm CPURenesas Electronics and Renesas Mobile License ARM Processor IP for Next Generation Communications Processors and Application Processors) * System LSIs (System on a Chip e.g. R-Car) ** Analog and Power Management ICs ** Memory ** Optoelectronics ** RF Devices ** Sensors ** Software and Tools ** Aerospace and Harsh Environment ICs ** Timing and Logic ICs ** Discrete Power ** Wireless Power **ASICs === Microcontrollers === ==== The RX MCU family ==== The RX, an acronym for Renesas Xtreme, is the family name for a range of 32-bit microcontrollers developed by Renesas, as opposed to the H family and the MC family, launched by Hitachi and Mitsubishi respectively. The RX family was launched in 2009 by Renesas Technology with the first product range designated the RX600 series and targeting applications such as metering, motor control, human–machine interfaces (HMI), networking, and industrial automation. Since 2009 this MCU family range has been enlarged with a smaller variant the RX200 series and also through enhanced performance versions. Key to the high performance of the microcontroller is the CISC architecture with high performance integrated flash memory enabling the central processing unit (CPU) to operate at very high frequency, 100 MHz, without requiring wait-states for the memory accesses resulting in performance up to 1.65 DMIPS/MHz. ==== The RA MCU family ==== The RA, an acronym for Renesas Advanced, is the family name for a range of 32-bit microcontrollers with Arm Cortex processor cores. The RA family's key features are the stronger embedded security, high-performance, and CoreMark ultra-low power operation. It also has a comprehensive partner ecosystem and Flexible Software Package for the users. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+MCU Family Specifications !Family !CPU !Operating Frequency !Program Memory (KB) !Data Flash (KB) !RAM (KB) !Lead Count !Supply Voltage |- |RA |ARM CM23 ARM CM33 ARM CM4 |48 100 120 200 |32, 64, 128, 256, 384, 512, 768, 1024, 2048 |4, 8, 32, 63 |16, 32, 64, 96, 128 256, 384, 640 |25, 32, 36, 40, 48 56, 64, 80, 100 144, 145 176 |1.6 - 5.5 1.8 - 3.6 2.7 - 3.6 2.7 - 3.7 |} === Microprocessors === ==== The RZ Arm-based 32 & 64-bit family ==== The Renesas RZ family is a high-end 32 & 64 bit microprocessors that is designed for the implementations of high resolution human machine interface (HMI), embedded vision, embedded artificial intelligence (e-AI), real-time control, and industrial ethernet connectivity.

In early May 2012, NEC transferred part of its stake in Renesas to its employee pension trust. As a result, the NEC pension fund held 32.4 percent of Renesas while NEC had 3.0 percent. ==Manufacturing sites== As of 2021, the in-house wafer fabrication of the semiconductor device is conducted by Renesas Semiconductor Manufacturing, a wholly owned subsidiary operating six front-end plants in the following areas: * Naka, Takasaki, Shiga, Saijo, Yamaguchi, Kawashiri The back-end facilities, directly affiliated to Renesas Electronics, are located in: * Yonezawa, Oita, Nishiki == References == ==External links== * Renesas Electronics Microcontrollers * Electronics Weekly: Renesas RX series microcontrollers – an overview * Bloomberg: Renesas Electronics America Expands Its RX Microcontroller * Category:Microcontroller companies Category:Japanese companies established in 2010 Category:Companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Category:Electronics companies established in 2010 Category:Japanese brands Category:Manufacturing companies based in Tokyo Category:Multinational companies headquartered in Japan Category:Semiconductor companies of Japan",
