The equipment consists of a broom handle and a rubber ball, typically a spaldeen, pensy pinky, high bouncer or tennis ball. The rules come from baseball and are modified to fit the situation. For example, a manhole cover may be used as a base, or buildings for foul lines. The game is a variation of stick and ball games dating back to at least the 1750s. This game was widely popular among youths during the 20th century until the 1980s. ==Variants== Many Native American cultures in what is now the eastern United States played a stickball- like game that is the ancestor of modern-day lacrosse, using hickory sticks and a ball made of deer hair or hide.\"Stickball (a ne jo di)\" at cherokee.org; retrieved 09 June 2014.
