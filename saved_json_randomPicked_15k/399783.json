Mirza partnered with Barbora Strýcová in late 2016 (winning two titles) and some parts of the 2017 season. In 2017, her sole title came at Brisbane, where she played alongside her friend Mattek-Sands. However, Mirza struggled to find a committed partner to play with in the 2017 season, which resulted in her falling out of the top 5. The last tournament she played was the China Open, where she lost in the semifinals partnering Peng Shuai. Mirza missed the first few tournaments of the 2018 season, including the Australian Open, citing a knee injury she sustained in October 2017. In early February 2018, Mirza said the same injury would keep her out of competition for a further two months. In April, Mirza announced on Instagram that she was pregnant with her first child, with husband Shoaib Malik. In late October, Mirza had delivered a baby boy. ===2020–present: Winning return=== In late 2018, Mirza announced she hoped to return to professional tennis in plenty time for the 2020 Summer Olympics. After having celebrated her son's first birthday and having spent more than two years off the professional circuit, she returned to the tour at the Hobart International in January 2020 playing alongside Nadiia Kichenok. The newly formed team won the tournament beating second seeds Peng Shuai/Zhang Shuai in the final. However, the team lost their first round match at the 2020 Australian Open because of a calf injury suffered by Mirza. She played in the 2020 Summer Olympics with Ankita Raina, but lost to Ukrainian Pair in the first round. ==Playing style== Mirza is an offensive baseliner with very powerful groundstroke and is known for setting up good attacks with the sheer velocity of her groundstrokes. Her main strength is her forehand, as well as her volleying skills. Her power game has drawn comparisons to Romanian legend Ilie Năstase. She is also a great returner of serve finding many return winners during matches. Mirza goes for winners, which means she goes for many angles. Mirza has said that \"There's no doubt that my forehand and backhand can match anyone, it's about the place that they're put in. I can hit the ball as hard as anyone can\". \"I'm not that fast on my feet\", she added as her most evident weakness is her movement around the court, where Mirza usually struggles moving up and around the court. Mirza's second serve and relatively poor mobility are often quoted as her big weaknesses. But by 2012, a series of injuries had effectively ended her singles career. ==Awards and recognition== * Arjuna Award (2004) * WTA Newcomer of the Year (2005) * Padma Shri (2006) * Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna (2015) * BBC list of 100 inspiring women (2015) * Padma Bhushan (2016) * NRI of the Year (2016) In the year 2014, the government of Telangana appointed Sania Mirza as the brand ambassador of the state. Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao congratulated Sania Mirza on her being awarded Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award. She was named in the Time magazine's 2016 list of 100 most influential people in the world. ==Personal life== In 2009, Sania Mirza became engaged to childhood friend Sohrab Mirza. However, the wedding was called off shortly after. On 12 April 2010, she married Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Malik in a traditional Hyderabadi Muslim wedding ceremony at the Taj Krishna Hotel in Hyderabad, India followed by Pakistani wedding customs for a mahr of 6.1 million (US$137,500). Their Walima ceremony was held in Sialkot, Pakistan. The couple announced their first pregnancy on social media on 23 April 2018. In October 2018, Shoaib Malik announced on Twitter that Mirza had delivered a baby boy and named him Izhaan Mirza Malik. ==Other activities== In 2014, Mirza was the brand ambassador for the Indian state of Telangana to promote the interests of the then newly created state. Mirza has established a tennis academy in Hyderabad. Former world No. 1s and multiple Grand Slam winners Cara Black and Martina Navratilova have both visited the academy on different occasions. Sania Mirza was announced the UN Women Goodwill Ambassador for South Asia. She is the first South Asian woman to be appointed as a Goodwill Ambassador in the organization's history. ==Controversies== In 2006, some newspapers reported that Mirza declined to play doubles with Israeli tennis player Shahar Pe'er for fear of protests from India's Muslim community. On 4 February 2008, Mirza said that she would stop appearing in tennis tournaments held in India, starting with the 2008 Bangalore Open the following month, citing the series of controversies and upon advice by her manager. But Mirza chose to participate at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. After both Mahesh Bhupathi and Rohan Bopanna refused to play in the men's doubles event at the 2012 Olympics with Leander Paes, Paes demanded that he be partnered with Mirza for the mixed doubles event. Mirza accused the All India Tennis Association (AITA) of using her as 'bait' to keep Paes happy as she wanted to play with Bhupathi, with whom she has won 2 grand slams. In the end, Mirza was paired with Paes and the pair lost in the quarterfinals of the mixed doubles. Sania Mirza, along with Sunitha Rao, was photographed violating the dress code at Beijing Olympic Opening Ceremony parade in 2008. In response, Mirza reaffirmed loyalty to the land of her birth—\"To see the national flag go up while standing on the podium is the proudest moment in an athlete's life and I will want to experience that for myself in London.\" Mirza was referred to as \"Pakistan's daughter-in-law\" and unfit to be a representative of an Indian state after she was appointed the Telangana state's brand ambassador. The comment referred to Mirza's husband, Shoaib Malik being a Pakistani cricketer. Telangana chief minister Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao presented Mirza with 1 crore on two occasions. She was summoned by the tax department for non-payment of service tax on the payment received, however she responded that the 1 crore given was training incentive, and not towards becoming state's brand ambassador. ==Career statistics== === Grand Slam performance timelines=== ====Women's doubles==== {|class=wikitable style=text-align:center; |- !Tournament!!2004!!2005!!2006!!2007!!2008!!2009!!2010!!2011!!2012!!2013!!2014!!2015!!2016!!2017!!...!!2020!!2021 !2022!!SR!!W–L |- | align=\"left\" |Australian Open |A |A | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |1R | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |3R | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |3R | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |1R | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |3R | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |1R | bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |1R | bgcolor=\"ffebcd\" |QF | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |2R | bgcolor=\"lime\" |W | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |3R | | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |1R |A |bgcolor=afeeee|1R |1 / 14 |22–13 |- | align=\"left\" |French Open |A | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |2R | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |3R | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |1R |A | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |2R |A | bgcolor=\"thistle\" |F | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |1R | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |3R | bgcolor=\"ffebcd\" |QF | bgcolor=\"ffebcd\" |QF | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |3R | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |1R | |A |A | |0 / 11 |19–11 |- | align=\"left\" |Wimbledon |Q1 | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |1R | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |2R | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |3R | bgcolor=\"ffebcd\" |QF | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |2R | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |2R | bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |3R | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |3R | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |2R | bgcolor=\"lime\" |W | bgcolor=\"ffebcd\" |QF | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |3R | | style=\"color:#696969\" |NH | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |2R | |1 / 14 |29–13 |- | align=\"left\" |US Open |A | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |1R | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |3R | bgcolor=\"ffebcd\" |QF |A | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |2R | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |1R | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |3R | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |3R | bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF | bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF | bgcolor=\"lime\" |W | bgcolor=\"ffebcd\" |QF | bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF | |A | bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |1R | |1 / 13 |31–12 |-style=background:#efefef;font- weight:bold | style=\"text-align:left\" |Win–loss |0–0 |1–3 |5–4 |7–4 |6–3 |2–3 |3–3 |11–4 |8–4 |8–4 |11–4 |16–2 |14–3 |8–4 | |0–1 |1–2 |0–1 |3 / 52 |101–49 |} ====Mixed doubles==== {|class=wikitable style=text-align:center |- !Tournament!!2005!!2006!!2007!!2008!!2009!!2010!!2011!!2012!!2013!!2014!!2015!!2016!!2017!!...!!2021 !2022!!SR |- |align=left|Australian Open |A |bgcolor=afeeee|1R |bgcolor=afeeee|1R |bgcolor=thistle|F |bgcolor=lime|W |A |A |bgcolor=yellow|SF |bgcolor=ffebcd|QF |bgcolor=thistle|F |bgcolor=yellow|SF |bgcolor=yellow|SF |bgcolor=thistle|F | |A |bgcolor=ffebcd|QF |1 / 11 |- |align=left|French Open |A |bgcolor=afeeee|1R |bgcolor=afeeee|2R |A |bgcolor=afeeee|1R |A |bgcolor=afeeee|1R |bgcolor=lime|W |bgcolor=afeeee|1R |bgcolor=afeeee|2R |bgcolor=afeeee|1R |bgcolor=thistle|F |bgcolor=ffebcd|QF | |A | |1 / 10 |- |align=left|Wimbledon |bgcolor=afeeee|2R |bgcolor=afeeee|3R |bgcolor=afeeee|2R |bgcolor=afeeee|2F |bgcolor=afeeee|3R |A |bgcolor=ffebcd|QF |bgcolor=afeeee|2R |bgcolor=ffebcd|QF |bgcolor=afeeee|3R |bgcolor=ffebcd|QF |bgcolor=afeeee|2R |bgcolor=afeeee|3R | |bgcolor=afeeee|3R | |0 / 13 |- |align=left|US Open |A |bgcolor=afeeee|1R |bgcolor=ffebcd|QF |A |bgcolor=afeeee|2R |A |bgcolor=afeeee|1R |bgcolor=ffebcd|QF |bgcolor=afeeee|1R |bgcolor=lime|W |bgcolor=afeeee|1R |bgcolor=afeeee|2R |bgcolor=afeeee|1R | |bgcolor=afeeee|1R | |1 / 11 |} ===Grand Slam finals=== ====Women's doubles: 4 (3 titles, 1 runner–up)==== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" !
