 "text": "The North Dakota Senate is the upper house of the North Dakota Legislative Assembly, smaller than the North Dakota House of Representatives. Per the state constitution, North Dakota is divided into between 40 and 54 legislative districts apportioned by population as determined by the decennial census. The 2000 redistricting plan provided for 47 districts, with one senator elected from each district. Senators serve four-year terms. Elections are staggered such that half the senate districts have elections every two years. The Senate Chamber is located in the North Dakota State Capitol in Bismarck, North Dakota. ==Composition== :67th Legislative Assembly (2021–2023) {|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\" |- style=\"vertical-align:bottom;\" !rowspan=3|Affiliation !colspan=2|Party (Shading indicates majority caucus) !rowspan=3|Total ! |-style=\"height:5px\" | style=\"background-color:\" | | style=\"background-color:\" | |style=\"background: black\"| |- !Republican !Democratic-NPL !Vacant |- ! style=\"font-size:80%\" nowrap=\"nowrap\" |65th Legislative Assembly || 38 | 9 ! 47 | 0 |- |colspan=5| |- ! style=\"font- size:80%\" nowrap=\"nowrap\" |66th Legislative Assembly || 37 | 10 ! 47 | 0 |- ! style=\"font-size:80%\" nowrap=\"nowrap\" |67th Legislative Assembly || 40 | 7 ! 47 | 0 |- !Latest voting share !| ! !colspan=2| |} ===2021 Officers=== {| class=wikitable !
