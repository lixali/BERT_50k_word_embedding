 "text": "The Telugu Desam Party (TDP; ), is a regional Indian political party active in the southern states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The party was founded by N. T. Rama Rao on 29 March 1982. Since 1995 the party has been headed by N. Chandrababu Naidu, former Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. The party's headquarters is located at NTR Bhavan in Hyderabad. N. T. Rama Rao became the 10th Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh in 1983, within nine months of the party's formation, thus forming the first non-Indian National Congress (INC) government in Andhra Pradesh. TDP was the first regional party to become the main opposition party at the 8th Lok Sabha from 1984 to 1989. An internal party coup played out in August 1995 and an indignant NTR, who was desperate to explain to anybody who cared to listen about this ‘treachery’ (he used the exact same word in a press meet), finally died in January 1996. The party was taken over by Chandra Babu Naidu On 16 March 2018 the TDP walked out of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). After the TDP's electoral defeat in the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls held on 11 April 2019, the TDP's legislative party in the Rajya Sabha merged with that of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). ==Ideology and Symbolism== The Telugu Desam Party follows a pro-Telugu ideology. It was founded as an alternative to the Congress hegemony, by emphasizing Telugu regional pride and serving as the party for farmers, backward castes and middle class people. Since the 1990s, it has followed an economically liberal policy that has been seen as pro-business and pro- development. The TDP uses yellow as the background colour for the flag with a hut, wheel and plough symbol in the foreground. A bicycle is used as the official party symbol. ==Lok Sabha Election History== The total number of Lok Sabha seats in (previously undivided) Andhra Pradesh (1956-2014) was 42. After the 2014 bifurcation of the state, there are 25 Lok Sabha seats in Andhra Pradesh and 17 Lok Sabha seats in Telangana. The National United Front was formed with N. T. Rama Rao as chairperson. Under the leadership of Chandrababu Naidu the NDA government was formed with Atal Bihari Vajpayee as the Prime Minister of India. The TDP had G. M. C. Balayogi as the 12th Speaker of the Lok Sabha. TDP was the second largest party in 1984 Indian General Elections, winning 30 seats with 4.31% of votes, thus achieving the distinction of becoming the first regional party to become a national opposition party. However, in the next election they were reduced to only 2 seats out of 42 contested, which has to this day remained the biggest defeat for the party. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
