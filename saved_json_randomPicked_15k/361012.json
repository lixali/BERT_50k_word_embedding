 "text": "The Paper Lads is a children's television series produced by Tyne Tees Television and broadcast nationally from 1977 to 1979. It was set in the northern industrial city of Newcastle upon Tyne, although much of the series was filmed in Gateshead, and recounted the adventures of a group of newspaper delivery boys and a girl. There were two series made, each of seven episodes. William Corlett's four scripts for the series won him the Writer's Guild Award for Best Children's Writer.William Corlett, The Door in The Tree, Pocket Books, page 298. The signature tune of the series, \"Back Home Once Again\", was performed by progressive rock band Renaissance, and it appears (re-recorded) as a full-length song on their 1978 album A Song for All Seasons. The full series was released on DVD by Network in July 2013. Two novels by William Humble based on the series were released by children's paperback publisher Target Books. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1977 British television series debuts Category:1979 British television series endings Category:1970s British children's television series Category:ITV children's television shows Category:Television shows set in Tyne and Wear Category:Television shows set in Newcastle upon Tyne Category:Television series by ITV Studios Category:English-language television shows Category:Television shows produced by Tyne Tees Television",
