 "text": "This is a list of sexually active popes, Catholic priests who were not celibate before they became pope, and popes who were legally married, while people under holy orders are usually required to be celibate. Some candidates were sexually active before their election as pope, and others were accused of being sexually active during their papacies. A number of them had offspring. The Second Lateran Council (1139) made the promise to remain celibate a prerequisite to ordination, abolishing the married priesthood in the Latin Church. Sexual relationships were generally undertaken therefore outside the bond of matrimony and each sexual act thus committed is considered a mortal sin by the Catholic Church. There are various classifications for those who were sexually active at some time during their lives. Periods in parentheses refer to the years of their papacies. == Background == For many years of the Church's history, celibacy was considered optional. Based on the customs of the times, it is assumed by many that most of the Apostles, such as Peter, were married and had families. The New Testament (Mk 1:29–31; Mt 8:14–15; Lk 4:38–39; 1 Tim 3:2, 12; Tit 1:6) depicts at least Peter as being married, and bishops, priests and deacons of the Early Church were often married as well. In epigraphy, the testimony of the Church Fathers, synodal legislation, papal decretals and other sources in the following centuries a married clergy, in greater or lesser numbers, was a normal feature of the life of the Church. Celibacy was not required for those ordained, and was a discipline that could be practised in the early Church, particularly by those in the monastic life. Although various local Church councils had demanded celibacy of the clergy in a particular area, at the Second Lateran Council (1139), the whole of the Latin Church of the Catholic Church decided to accept men for ordination only after they had taken a promise of celibacy. This applies to the leadership of the Church.Priestly celibacy retrieved June 9, 2008 == Popes who were legally married == {| class=\"wikitable\" !width=10%|Name !width=10%|Reign(s) !Relationship !Offspring !Notes |- |Saint Peter |30/33–64/68 |Mother-in-law (Greek πενθερά, penthera) is mentioned in the Gospel verses , , and who was healed by Jesus at her home in Capernaum. asks whether others have the right to be accompanied by Christian wives as does \"Cephas\" (Peter).

Such accusations found in Liutprand of Cremona's Antapodosis, as well as the Liber Pontificalis.Liber Pontificalis (first ed., 500s; it has papal biographies up to Pius II, d. 1464)Reverend Horace K. Mann, The Lives of the Popes in the Early Middle Ages, Volumes 1–13 quote: \"Was John XI the son of Pope Sergius by the abandoned Marozia? Liutprand says he was, and so does the author of the anonymous catalogue in the Liber Pontificalis in his one-line notice of John XI.\" (1928)Anura Gurugé, The Next Pope: After Pope Benedict XVI, page 37: \"John XI (#126) would also appear to have been born out of wedlock. His mother, Marozia, from the then powerful Theophylacet family, was around sixteen years old at the time. Liber Pontificalis, among others, claim that Sergius III (#120), during his tenure as pope, was the father.\" (WOWNH LLC, 2010). The accusations are disputed by another early source, the annalist Flodoard (c. 894–966): John XI was brother of Alberic II, the latter being the offspring of Marozia and her husband Alberic I, so John too may have been the son of Marozia and Alberic I. Fauvarque emphasizes that contemporary sources are dubious, Liutprand being \"prone to exaggeration\" while other mentions of this fatherhood appear in satires written by supporters of Pope Formosus.Fauvarque, Bertrand (2003). \"De la tutelle de l'aristocratie italienne à celle des empereurs germaniques\".

He appointed Giovanni Borgia as Captain General of the Church, and made Cesare a Cardinal of the Church – also creating independent duchies for each of them out of papal lands. |} ===Relationships with men=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !width=10%|Name !width=10%|Reign !Relationship !Notes |- |Paul II |1464–1471 |Not married.
