 "text": "In set theory, when dealing with sets of infinite size, the term almost or nearly is used to refer to all but a negligible amount of elements in the set. The notion of \"negligible\" depends on the context, and may mean \"of measure zero\" (in a measure space), \"finite\" (when infinite sets are involved), or \"countable\" (when uncountably infinite sets are involved). For example: *The set S = \\\\{ n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\,|\\, n \\ge k \\\\} is almost \\mathbb{N} for any k in \\mathbb{N}, because only finitely many natural numbers are less than k. *The set of prime numbers is not almost \\mathbb{N}, because there are infinitely many natural numbers that are not prime numbers. *The set of transcendental numbers are almost \\mathbb{R}, because the algebraic real numbers form a countable subset of the set of real numbers (which is uncountable). *The Cantor set is uncountably infinite, but has Lebesgue measure zero. So almost all real numbers in (0, 1) are members of the complement of the Cantor set. ==See also== *Almost all *Almost surely *Approximation *List of mathematical jargon == References == Category:Mathematical terminology Category:Set theory de:Fast alle",
