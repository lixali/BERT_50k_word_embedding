 "text": "Nitrogen oxide may refer to a binary compound of oxygen and nitrogen, or a mixture of such compounds: ==Charge-neutral== * Nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen(II) oxide, or nitrogen monoxide * Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen(IV) oxide * Nitrogen trioxide (NO3), or nitrate radical * Nitrous oxide (N2O), nitrogen(0,II) oxide * Dinitrogen dioxide (N2O2), nitrogen(II) oxide dimer * Dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3), nitrogen(II,IV) oxide * Dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4), nitrogen(IV) oxide dimer * Dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5), nitrogen(V) oxide, or nitronium nitrate [NO2]+[NO3]− * Nitrosylazide (N4O), nitrogen(−I,0,I,II) oxide * Oxatetrazole (N4O) * Trinitramide ( or ), nitrogen(0,IV) oxide ==Anions== * Nitroxyl (NO−) * Nitrite () * Nitrate () * Peroxynitrite () * Peroxynitrate () * Orthonitrate () * Hyponitrite () * Trioxodinitrate (), or hyponitrate * Nitroxylate () * Dinitramide ( or ) ==Cations== *Nitrosonium () *Nitronium () ==Atmospheric sciences== In atmospheric chemistry: * (or NOx) refers to the sum of NO and NO2.United States Clean Air Act, * (or NOy) = the sum of all oxidized atmospheric odd- nitrogen species (e.g. NOx \\+ HNO3 \\+ HNO2 \\+ etc.) * (or NOz) = NOy − NOx Image:Nitric-oxide-3D-vdW.png|Nitric oxide, NO Image:Nitrogen- dioxide-3D-vdW.png|Nitrogen dioxide, NO2 Image:Nitrous- oxide-3D-vdW.png|Nitrous oxide, N2O Image:Dinitrogen- trioxide-3D-vdW.png|Dinitrogen trioxide, N2O3 Image:Dinitrogen- tetroxide-3D-vdW.png|Dinitrogen tetroxide, N2O4 Image:Dinitrogen- pentoxide-3D-vdW.png|Dinitrogen pentoxide, N2O5 Image:Trinitramide-3D-spacefill.png|Trinitramide, N4O6 ==Stability== Due to relatively weak N-O bonding, all nitrogen oxides are unstable with respect to N2 and O2, which is the principle behind the catalytic converter and prevents the combustion of the atmosphere. ==See also== *Nitrate *Nitrogen oxide sensor *Sulfur nitrides, which are valence isoelectronic with nitrogen oxides ==References== Category:Industrial gases *",
