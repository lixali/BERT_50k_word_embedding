She presented the magazine programme Live from Studio Five and was formerly the co-presenter of the reality show Cowboy Builders. ==Early life== Messenger was born in Swindon, Wiltshire. After attending different schools, one of which was Dorcan Technology College, she spent six months working as a flight attendant for Britannia Airways. She then joined a local marketing company and rose to become customer services manager, overseeing a staff of 50 employees. ==Career== ===Modelling=== Messenger decided to become a model, and was advised by the Jason Paul Modelling Agency to enhance her breasts, which she enlarged to a 34DD cup. She then took a job modelling for a Gloucester-based double glazing company, Glevum, dressed only in pants and a bra. As part of an advertising campaign called \"Class Behind Glass\", the posters quickly began disappearing from bus stops, having been taken by locals. After a complaint at the lack of clothes on Messenger, the Advertising Standards Authority banned the campaign, claiming they were not sufficiently \"classy\". After local newspapers reported on this, the Daily Star ran the story on 28 January 1997 as a photo-shoot of Messenger, under the headline \"Move Over Eva Herzigova\". In 1997 she won Rear of the Year. Signed by modelling agent Yvonne Paul, who had steered Samantha Fox to fame in the 1980s, Messenger's career accelerated. She posed for designers including Vivienne Westwood, then appeared on The Sun newspaper's Page Three; the publication later hailed her as the \"Girl of the Thrillenium!\". Her work for the newspaper entailed visiting the Spanish coasts and English seaside resorts, an assignment known as \"Mel's Big Bus Tour\". She continued working for The Sun until readers voted to ban models with breast implants. ===Move from modelling=== Messenger appeared in a cameo role in 1999's Virtual Sexuality as Superbra Girl, and costarred in the 2000 cult film The Mumbo Jumbo in the role of Princess Vanilla. She worked on Channel 4 cult show Eurotrash and became a popular pantomime actress, taking on roles such as Cinderella (2004–2005) and Aladdin (with Bobby Davro and John Rhys-Davies; Woking – 2005–2006). === Motherhood and becoming a presenter=== Following the birth of her first child on 7 April 2000, by emergency caesarian section after she collapsed with pre-eclampsia, Messenger concentrated on developing her career as a television presenter. Messenger released her Back into Shape Workout DVD, which was a six-week fitness programme designed to help new mothers recover their fitness. She appeared on Noel Edmonds – Gotcha! in which she was one of the subjects to receive the treatment from Noel and his team. Messenger had her own issue of At Home With... magazine called \"At Home With Melinda Messenger\", which was aimed at parents. She joined with chef Antony Worrall Thompson in May 2008 and contributed some recipes for the cookbook The Sweet Life. ===Television=== Messenger's TV career began in 1997 on Channel 4's Eurotrash, where she featured as a \"roving reporter\" in erotic scenarios, including modelling fetish wear and acting as a nude magician's assistant. In 1998–99 she hosted her own show on Channel 5 called Melinda's Big Night In. From 1998 to 2001, Messenger became an assistant on game show Fort Boyard which ran for four series on Channel 5. She joined ex-Eastender Leslie Grantham and Catweazle star Geoffrey Bayldon in the game show which tested contestants' physical agility and brainpower on the sea fortress in France. In 2002, she appeared on Celebrity Big Brother. She has since presented many TV programmes, including Loose Lips (with Richard Arnold), Baby Baby, Can We Still Be Friends, Beat The Dealer and Beat the Crusher.
