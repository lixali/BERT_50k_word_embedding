 "text": "Judith Arlene Resnik (April 5, 1949 – January 28, 1986) was an American electrical engineer, software engineer, biomedical engineer, pilot and NASA astronaut who died in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster aboard the during the launch of mission STS-51-L. Resnik was the fourth woman, the second American woman, and the first Jewish woman of any nationality to fly in space, logging 145 hours in orbit. Her first space flight was the STS-41-D mission in August and September 1984, when her duties included operating the Space Shuttle's robotic arm. Recognized while still a child for her \"intellectual brilliance\", Resnik was accepted at Carnegie Mellon University after being one of only sixteen women in the history of the United States to have attained a perfect score on the SAT exam at the time. She went on to graduate with a degree in electrical engineering from Carnegie Mellon before attaining a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of Maryland. Resnik went on to work for RCA as an engineer on Navy missile and radar projects, was a senior systems engineer for Xerox Corporation and published research on special- purpose integrated circuitry before she was recruited by NASA to the astronaut program as a mission specialist at age 28. While training on the astronaut program, she developed software and operating procedures for NASA missions. She was also a pilot and made research contributions to biomedical engineering as a research fellow at the National Institutes of Health. == Early life == Judith Arlene Resnik was born in Akron, Ohio on April 5, 1949, the daughter of Marvin Resnik, an optometrist, and his wife Sarah Polensky, a legal secretary. She had a brother, Charles, who was four years younger. Her father was the son of a rabbi, and he had been born in Preluke in Ukraine. His family had emigrated to Israel in the 1920s, and then to the United States after the 1929 Hebron massacre. He was fluent in eight languages and served in the Army during World War II in military intelligence and aerial reconnaissance in the Pacific Theater and the Occupation of Japan. Resnik grew up in an observant Jewish home, studying at Hebrew school at Beth El Synagogue in Akron and celebrating her Bat Mitzvah in 1962. Resnik was noticed for \"intellectual brilliance\" while still in kindergarten, and she entered elementary school a year early. She attended Fairlawn Elementary School, Simon Perkins Junior High School, and Harvey S. Firestone High School. She was an outstanding student, excelling in mathematics, languages and piano. Playing classical piano with \"more than technical mastery\", she planned on becoming a professional concert pianist. When questioned about her intensity at the piano, she replied, \"I never play anything softly\". Before college, she attained a perfect score on her SAT exam, the only woman in the country to do so that year and one of only 16 women at that time to have done so. She graduated from Firestone in 1966 as valedictorian and runner-up homecoming queen. Although her mother disapproved of her dating, she had a series of boyfriends. She preferred to socialize with boys from nearby Copley High School rather than from Firestone, where her intellectual reputation preceded her. She met Len Nahmi at a basketball game. He was half Irish and half Lebanese, and her mother disapproved of him. Nonetheless, she continued to see him secretly , and when she stayed with a cousin in Cleveland while taking a college course available to high school students, she also met with him there. Her parents acrimoniously divorced while she was a teenager, and custody was given to her mother, as was the custom in the United States. Her mother's dislike of Nahmi became more intense, and Nahmi eventually ended their relationship to spare Resnik more pain. When she was 17, she prepared and filed a successful court case so that her custody could be switched from her mother to her father, with whom she was particularly close. She tore up letters from her mother unopened. Her father remarried, and she acquired twin stepsisters, Linda and Sandy, who where nine years older than her, and with whom she became quite close. thumb|left|Resnik in June 1979 At age 17, Resnik entered Carnegie Institute of Technology and ultimately was one of three female students in electrical engineering. She joined the Alpha Epsilon Phi sorority. In her second year she developed a passion for electrical engineering, discovering her interest in \"practical aspects of science\" after attending lectures with her boyfriend and future husband, Michael Oldak, who was on the engineering course. Oldak said, \"She was a math whiz, but at some point math lost the numbers and she wanted something more tangible so she switched her collegiate major to electrical engineering\". She was a gourmet cook and a navigator in sports car rallies, in which she took part many times with Oldak in his Triumph TR6. She earned a bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering from Carnegie Mellon University (as it now was) in 1970. She became a member of Tau Beta Pi and Eta Kappa Nu honor societies. Resnik married Oldak on July 14, 1970. Her mother attended the wedding; two sets of invitations were sent out, one describing her as her father's daughter, and the other as her mother's. Upon graduation from Carnegie Mellon, Resnik and Oldak moved to Moorestown, New Jersey, where they both worked for RCA. She was a design engineer on missile and radar projects and won the Graduate Study Program Award. She performed circuit design for the missile and surface radar division. While at RCA, she worked for the Navy building custom integrated circuitry for the phased-array radar control systems and developed electronics and software for NASA's sounding rocket and telemetry systems programs. An academic paper she wrote on special purpose integrated circuitry caught the attention of NASA during this time. She registered for master's degree evening courses at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1971, Oldak was accepted into Georgetown University law school, and they moved to Washington, D.C. Resnik continued to work for RCA, transferring to its office in Springfield, Virginia, and she continued pursuing her master's degree at the University of Maryland. She then entered a doctoral program. Resnik and Oldak divorced in 1975—he wanted to start a family and she did not—but they remained in contact and on good terms. While working on her doctorate, Resnik switched jobs in 1974, and went to work as a research fellow in biomedical engineering at the Laboratory of Neurophysiology at the National Institutes of Health. As a biomedical engineer, Resnik researched the physiology of visual systems. In 1977 she earned her Ph.D. in electrical engineering with honors at the University of Maryland, writing her dissertation on \"Bleaching kinetics of visual pigments\". Her research involved the effects of electrical currents on the retina. An academic paper co-written by her concerning the biomedical engineering of optometry (\"A novel rapid scanning microspectrophotometer and its use in measuring rhodopsin photoproduct pathways and kinetics in frog retinas\") was published in the Journal of the Optical Society of America in 1978. == NASA astronaut == === Selection and training === After her divorce from Oldak, Resnik reconnected with Nahmi, who was now a commercial airline pilot. When he heard that the National Air and Space Administration (NASA) was recruiting women to become astronauts, he encouraged her to apply. They read Carrying the Fire by Michael Collins, a former astronaut who had flown to the Moon on Apollo 11, and she met with him in his office at the National Air and Space Museum. She also met with another former astronaut, John Glenn, who was now a United States senator from her home state of Ohio. Nahmi convinced her to obtain a private pilot's licence in order to bolster her credentials. Resnik qualified as a pilot in 1977, while completing her Ph.D., having achieved near perfect scores in her flying exams (two 100s and a 98). When she received a promotion at RCA and again when she completed her doctorate, he had her send NASA a telegram informing them. Resnik's mentor and advisor, Professor Angel G. Jordan, then Dean of Carnegie Mellon College of Engineering and later provost of Carnegie Mellon, also encouraged Resnik to apply for the program. Jordan later regretted doing so. \"She was an amazing person... I pushed her to excel, and I live with that memory every day.\" After she completed her doctorate, Resnik became a senior systems engineer for Xerox Corporation in Los Angeles, working in product development. She rented an apartment in Redondo Beach, California, where she would jog along the beach to improve her stamina and reduce her weight. In January 1978, Resnik was recruited at age 28 into the NASA Astronaut Corps as a mission specialist with NASA Astronaut Group 8, one of six women selected out of over 8,000 male and female applicants in the first astronaut selection that included women. This involved taking a pay cut, as her new salary was considerably less than what she was being paid at Xerox. She dated some of her fellow astronaut candidates, who nicknamed her \"JR\". She trained intensely and with great determination, focusing particularly on her physical fitness. She piloted the Northrop T-38 Talon. Astronaut Jerome Apt described her as \"an excellent pilot and a superb operator in space\". She worked on research into the principle of orbital systems, flight software and the development of systems of manual control of spacecraft. She developed the software and operating procedures for the Space Shuttle's Remote Manipulator System (RMS). She also developed the deployment systems for the tethered satellite systems and worked on orbiter development, writing software for NASA to use on its missions. She disliked the part of her job that required making public appearances and drumming up support for the space program. She avoided television interviews when possible, and resented intrusive questions about her private life, such questions about her divorce. Fellow astronaut Rhea Seddon said that she had always felt that either Resnik or Sally Ride would become the first woman in the group to fly in space, as they were receiving \"the sorts of technical assignments which really prepared them for flight\", such as capsule communicator (CapCom) duties. As it turned out, the shortlisted candidates for the mission specialist assignments for the STS-7 mission included all six women, but since the mission involved the use of the RMS, the choice of the first woman to fly on the Space Shuttle narrowed to Resnik, Ride and Anna Fisher, who had specialized on it. Ride was chosen, and she became the first American woman in space. Asked about Resnik, Seddon said: \"I thought she was really really bright, obviously a very beautiful person, flirtatious, funny. She was just a live wire. We would do the happy hours, or we'd go on these NASA trips, and Judy was just a star attraction.\" === STS-41-D === In February 1983, Resnik was assigned to the crew of STS-41-D, the twelfth Space Shuttle flight, the maiden voyage of the , along with Henry Hartsfield, Michael Coats, Steven Hawley and Mike Mullane. After Hawley and Mullane had a fawning encounter with actor Bo Derek, who was working on the film Tarzan, the Ape Man, Resnik started calling Mullane \"Tarzan\" and Hawley \"Cheetah\"; when the office secretaries heard about this, they began referring to the STS-41-D crew as the \"zoo crew\". Resnik was a fan of Tom Selleck, and had a coffee cup that said: \"Excuse No. 1: I'm Saving Myself for Tom Selleck.\" Her crew mates hid a poster of Tom Selleck behind the bathroom curtain on Discovery. During a visit to a contractor's factory, Resnik whispered to Mullane: \"there are no maidens on this flight\". She was the center of attention on such visits, and one contractor engineer became a stalker, sending her unwelcome letters, poems and gifts. Eventually, after he appeared in the office, he had to be dealt with by NASA security. The STS-41-D mission's launch was delayed three times. The first attempt, on June 25, 1984, was aborted due to a failure of the backup computer. During the second attempt the following day, the computer detected a fault in one of the Space Shuttle Main Engines, and shut them down four seconds before liftoff. This was the first time a NASA space mission had been aborted after starting the engines since Gemini 6 in 1965. Discovery had to be taken back the Vehicle Assembly Building, where the faulty engine was replaced. A further launch attempt was made on August 30, but was again delayed for a day due to a software issue. Finally, on August 30, Discovery lifted off for the first time, and was in orbit eight minutes later. Resnik invited her family to watch the launch from the VIP viewing area. This included her father, brother, Oldak and Nahmi. Her mother was also in attendance, to avoid bad publicity. Resnik became the second American woman in space. She was also the first American Jewish astronaut to go into space, and the first Jewish woman. Her duties included operating the Space Shuttle's robotic arm, which she helped create and on which she was an expert. On the first day of the mission, Resnik and Mullane deployed the first of three commercial communications satellites, the SBS-4 satellite for Satellite Business Systems. On the second day, the crew released a second satellite, Syncom IV-2, also known as Leasat 2, for the U.S. Navy. While Hartsfield was filming its release with the IMAX camera for the documentary The Dream is Alive, Resnik's hair became caught in the camera's belt feed mechanism. The camera jammed, and she had to be cut free with scissors. Strands of loose hair floated about the cabin. Hartsfield informed the mission control center that the camera had jammed, but did not say why. Coats was able to repair the camera, and Hartsfield continued filming, while Resnik kept her distance. The crew deployed a third satellite, Telstar 302 for Telesat of Canada, without mishap the following day. That day Resnik also deployed the OAST-1 solar array wing, considered a potential future way of generating additional electrical power during space missions. After performing numerous dynamic tests that day and the next, she concluded that the experiment was well-behaved and matched ground simulations of the array. She advocated the benefits of the solar array technology, particularly for future use in powering space stations. During the mission, she held up a hand-written sign saying \"Hi Dad\" to the cameras, and in a live televised broadcast told President Ronald Reagan \"the Earth looks great\". When Reagan asked her if the flight was all she hoped it would be, she replied, \"It certainly is and I couldn't have picked a better crew to fly with.\" After the mission, Hartsfield described Resnik as the \"astronaut's astronaut\", while Mullane wrote: \"I was also happy to be crewed with Judy... She was smart, hardworking, and dependable, all the things you would want in a fellow crewmember.\" Discovery landed back at Edwards Air Force Base on September 5, after a flight lasting 6 days and 56 minutes. === Challenger disaster === On January 29, 1985, NASA announced that Resnik had been assigned to the crew of STS-51-L. The main objective of this mission was to launch TDRS-B, the second in a series of NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellites. It would also carry the Spartan (Shuttle Pointed Autonomous Research Tool for Astronomy), which would use two ultraviolet spectrometers to study the tail of Comet Halley. Resnik was primarily responsible for the operation of the RMS and, with fellow astronaut Ronald McNair, would deploy and later retrieve the Spartan. The flight would also carry Christa McAuliffe, a teacher-observer selected as part of NASA's Teacher in Space Project. Resnik was part of the team of astronauts who flew to Washington, D.C., to speak to the 113 finalists, and provide them an insider's view of a Space Shuttle mission. They were taken to the National Air and Space Museum, where they viewed The Dream is Alive with its scenes of Resnik deploying a satellite and eating and sleeping in space. She told them that it was a shame that they could not all fly in space, but privately she disagreed with NASA's decision to send civilians on the Space Shuttle. Resnik's assignment was tied to McAuliffe's; NASA wanted McAuliffe to fly with a veteran female astronaut. Initially scheduled for January 24, 1986, the launch was delayed until January 28 by rain, high winds and a trouble bolt on the 's door. Resnik's father and stepmother, and her brother and his family watched the launch from the VIP area, as did her Firestone High math teacher. She also invited Tom Selleck, but he declined the invitation. She carried with her a locket for her niece, and signet ring for her nephew, and a cigarette lighter for Nahmi. Challenger lifted off from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39B at 11:38 on January 28. A minute later Challenger broke up, torn apart by aerodynamic forces after a catastrophic failure of an O-ring seal on the starboard solid rocket booster. The cabin remained intact until it hit the water at , killing all on board. Her last recorded words aboard Challenger regarded scanning for \"LVLH\" (low-vertical/low-horizontal), reminding the cockpit crew of a switch configuration change. Following the Challenger disaster, examination of the recovered vehicle cockpit revealed that three of the crew members' Personal Egress Air Packs were activated for pilot Michael J. Smith and two other crew members. The location of Smith's activation switch on the back of his seat means either Resnik or Onizuka likely activated it for him. Mike Mullane wrote: This is the only evidence that shows Onizuka and Resnik were alive after the cockpit separated from the vehicle. If the cabin had lost pressure, the air packs alone would not have sustained the crew during the two-minute descent. Resnik's remains were recovered from the crashed vehicle cockpit by Navy divers of the . They were cremated and buried in Arlington National Cemetery on May 20, 1986, comingled with those of her the six Challenger crewmates . == Legacy == Resnik was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor. She was also awarded the NASA Space Flight Medal for her first flight. Landmarks and buildings being named for her include a dormitory at her alma mater, Carnegie Mellon University; Judith A. Resnik Elementary School in Gaithersburg, Maryland; Judith A. Resnik Community Learning Center in her hometown of Akron; and Judith A. Resnik Middle School, established in 2016, in San Antonio, Texas. A crater on the Moon was named after her, as was one on Venus, where all features are named after women. An asteroid, 3356 Resnik, was also named after her. A memorial to Resnik and the rest of the crew of Challenger was dedicated in Seabrook, Texas, where Resnik lived while stationed at the Johnson Space Center. The IEEE Judith A. Resnik Award was established in 1986 by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and is presented annually to an individual or team in recognition of outstanding contributions to space engineering in areas of relevance to the IEEE. The Society of Women Engineers (SWE) awards the Resnik Challenger Medal annually to \"a woman who has changed the space industry, has personally contributed innovative technology verified by flight experience (include launch date), and will be recognized through future decades as having created milestones in the development of space as a resource for all humankind.\" The Challenger Center was established in 1986 by the families of the Challenger crew, including Resnik's brother, Charles, in honor of the crew members. The goal of the center is to increase science, technology, engineering, and mathematics interest in children. == In popular culture == Resnik was portrayed by Julie Fulton in the 1990 made for TV movie Challenger. == See also == * List of female astronauts * List of Jewish astronauts == Notes == == References == * * * * * * * * * * == External links == * Challenger's Enduring Mission * Autographed Letter of Astronaut Judy Resnik Shapell Manuscript Foundation Category:1949 births Category:1986 deaths Category:American people of Israeli descent Category:American people of Ukrainian-Jewish descent Category:Carnegie Mellon University College of Engineering alumni Category:Burials at Arlington National Cemetery Category:Jewish-American history Category:Jewish astronauts Category:NASA civilian astronauts Category:People from Akron, Ohio Category:Recipients of the Congressional Space Medal of Honor Category:Space Shuttle program astronauts Category:Space Shuttle Challenger disaster victims Category:Systems engineers Category:University of Maryland, College Park alumni Category:Women astronauts Category:American women engineers",
