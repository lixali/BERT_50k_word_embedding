 "text": "That Peter Kay Thing is a series of six spoof documentaries shown on Channel 4 in 2000. It was written by Peter Kay, Dave Spikey, Neil Fitzmaurice and Gareth Hughes, and was directed by Andrew Gillman. The series was narrated by Andrew Sachs. Set in and around Bolton, each episode functions as a self-contained documentary following a different set of characters, many of them played by Kay. The pilot episode, \"The Services\", was shown in 1998 as an episode of Comedy Lab, a series which showcases pilots of experimental comedy shows. Many of the characters went on to appear in the successful spin-off series Phoenix Nights. ==Episode list== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\" !scope=\"col\" style=\"background: #E8C961;\"| No. !scope=\"col\" style=\"background: #E8C961;\"| Title !scope=\"col\" style=\"background: #E8C961;\"| Original broadcast date |- |} ==Characters== *Brian Potter (Kay) – Notoriously selfish social secretary of the working men's club The Neptune.
