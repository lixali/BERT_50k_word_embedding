Alberta is located immediately east of the continental divide, so no rivers from Alberta reach the Pacific Ocean. ==List of rivers in Alberta== The north of the province is drained towards the Arctic Ocean, and the northern rivers have comparatively higher discharge rates than the southern ones, that flow through a drier area. Most of Alberta's southern half has waters flowing toward the Hudson Bay, the only exception being the Milk River and its tributaries, that flow south through the Missouri and Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico. ===Arctic Ocean watershed=== Albertan rivers in the Arctic Ocean watershed are drained through Great Slave Lake and Mackenzie River, except for Petitot River which is drained through Liard River directly into the Mackenzie River, thus bypassing the Great Slave Lake. *Athabasca River **Chaba River **Sunwapta River **Whirlpool River **Astoria River **Miette River **Maligne River
