 "text": "The National Progressive Party (; ) was a liberal political party in Finland from 1918 to 1951. The party was founded 8 December 1918, after the Finnish Civil War, by the republican majority of the Young Finnish Party and the republican minority of the Finnish Party (the next day the monarchists of both parties founded the National Coalition Party.) Famous members of the party included Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg and Risto Ryti, the first and fifth Presidents of Finland, and Sakari Tuomioja. The National Progressive Party finished its existence in early 1951, as most of its active members had joined the People's Party of Finland. A minority group including Sakari Tuomioja founded the Liberal League. ==See also== *Liberal Party – Freedom to Choose *Liberalism and centrism in Finland ==References== Category:1918 establishments in Finland Category:1951 disestablishments in Finland Finland 1918 Category:Defunct political parties in Finland Category:Political parties disestablished in 1951 Category:Political parties established in 1918 Category:Political parties of the Russian Revolution",
