 "text": "In mathematics, the logarithmic integral function or integral logarithm li(x) is a special function. It is relevant in problems of physics and has number theoretic significance. In particular, according to the Siegel-Walfisz theorem it is a very good approximation to the prime-counting function, which is defined as the number of prime numbers less than or equal to a given value x. thumb|right|300px|Logarithmic integral function plot ==Integral representation== The logarithmic integral has an integral representation defined for all positive real numbers ≠ 1 by the definite integral : \\operatorname{li}(x) = \\int_0^x \\frac{dt}{\\ln t}. Here, denotes the natural logarithm. The function has a singularity at , and the integral for is interpreted as a Cauchy principal value, : \\operatorname{li}(x) = \\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0+} \\left( \\int_0^{1-\\varepsilon} \\frac{dt}{\\ln t} + \\int_{1+\\varepsilon}^x \\frac{dt}{\\ln t} \\right). ==Offset logarithmic integral== The offset logarithmic integral or Eulerian logarithmic integral is defined as : \\operatorname{Li}(x) = \\int_2^x \\frac{dt}{\\ln t} = \\operatorname{li}(x) - \\operatorname{li}(2). As such, the integral representation has the advantage of avoiding the singularity in the domain of integration. ==Special values== The function li(x) has a single positive zero; it occurs at x ≈ 1.45136 92348 83381 05028 39684 85892 02744 94930... ; this number is known as the Ramanujan–Soldner constant. −Li(0) = li(2) ≈ 1.045163 780117 492784 844588 889194 613136 522615 578151... This is -(\\Gamma\\left(0,-\\ln 2\\right) + i\\,\\pi) where \\Gamma\\left(a,x\\right) is the incomplete gamma function. It must be understood as the Cauchy principal value of the function. ==Series representation== The function li(x) is related to the exponential integral Ei(x) via the equation :\\hbox{li}(x)=\\hbox{Ei}(\\ln x) , \\,\\\\! which is valid for x > 0\\. This identity provides a series representation of li(x) as : \\operatorname{li}(e^u) = \\hbox{Ei}(u) = \\gamma + \\ln |u| + \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty {u^{n}\\over n \\cdot n!} \\quad \\text{ for } u e 0 \\; , where γ ≈ 0.57721 56649 01532 ... is the Euler–Mascheroni constant. A more rapidly convergent series by Ramanujan is : \\operatorname{li}(x) = \\gamma \\+ \\ln \\ln x \\+ \\sqrt{x} \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{ (-1)^{n-1} (\\ln x)^n} {n! \\, 2^{n-1}} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor (n-1)/2 \\rfloor} \\frac{1}{2k+1} . ==Asymptotic expansion== The asymptotic behavior for x → ∞ is : \\operatorname{li}(x) = O \\left( \\frac{x }{\\ln x} \\right) . where O is the big O notation. The full asymptotic expansion is : \\operatorname{li}(x) \\sim \\frac{x}{\\ln x} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{k!}{(\\ln x)^k} or : \\frac{\\operatorname{li}(x)}{x/\\ln x} \\sim 1 + \\frac{1}{\\ln x} + \\frac{2}{(\\ln x)^2} + \\frac{6}{(\\ln x)^3} + \\cdots. This gives the following more accurate asymptotic behaviour: : \\operatorname{li}(x) - \\frac{x}{ \\ln x} = O \\left( \\frac{x}{(\\ln x)^2} \\right) . As an asymptotic expansion, this series is not convergent: it is a reasonable approximation only if the series is truncated at a finite number of terms, and only large values of x are employed. This expansion follows directly from the asymptotic expansion for the exponential integral. This implies e.g. that we can bracket li as: : 1+\\frac{1}{\\ln x} < \\operatorname{li}(x) \\frac{\\ln x}{x} < 1+\\frac{1}{\\ln x}+\\frac{3}{(\\ln x)^2} for all \\ln x \\ge 11. ==Number theoretic significance== The logarithmic integral is important in number theory, appearing in estimates of the number of prime numbers less than a given value. For example, the prime number theorem states that: :\\pi(x)\\sim\\operatorname{li}(x) where \\pi(x) denotes the number of primes smaller than or equal to x. Assuming the Riemann hypothesis, we get the even stronger:Abramowitz and Stegun, p. 230, 5.1.20 :\\operatorname{li}(x)-\\pi(x) = O(\\sqrt{x}\\log x) For small x, \\operatorname{li}(x)>\\pi(x) but the difference changes sign an infinite number of times as x increases, and the first times this happens is somewhere between 1019 and 1.4×10316. == See also == * Jørgen Pedersen Gram * Skewes' number * List of integrals of logarithmic functions == References == * * Category:Special hypergeometric functions Category:Integrals",
