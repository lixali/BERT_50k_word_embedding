 "text": "Just for Laughs Gags (in French, Juste pour rire les gags) is a Canadian silent comedy/hidden camera reality television show that is under the Just for Laughs brand.Just for Laughs Gags \"This crazy but amazing team of Quebec-based comedian troupe uses the city as its stage, and its inhabitants, or victims, as characters! People are caught in a twisted yet funny web of comedic deception. This updated Candid Camera is a tad more risque and a little kookier with its practical jokes. The little snippets last only a few minutes, and some look more painful than others.\" The series uses a hidden camera format, playing pranks on unsuspecting subjects while hidden cameras capture the subjects' responses; each episode presents multiple gags. While some segments have included brief dialogue, most do not contain any sound or dialogue; the audio is replaced with sound effects, a laugh track, and public domain music. == Production == On 26 December 2000, JFL: Gags began airing on French Canadian network Canal D. In the following years, the show was picked up by TVA, CBC and The Comedy Network in Canada, BBC1 in the UK, TF1 in France and ABC and Telemundo in the United States; the Canadian version (unlike the ones produced for ABC) aired in the United States in first-run syndication starting in the fall of 2015. That version is distributed by PPI Partners and is available in both weekday strip and weekend runs.\"THE WHOLE WORLD'S LAUGHING WITH PPI. JUST FOR LAUGHS GAGS CLEARS 75% FOR SEPTEMBER 2015\" from PPI (March 2015) Most segments are filmed in Montreal, while some have been filmed in Quebec City, Vancouver and Mexico. British and Asian versions have been produced in the UK and Singapore, respectively. In 2011 the show spawned a spinoff, Just Kidding, which consists exclusively of kids playing pranks on adults. == Reception == With its silent format and no translation required (outside of gag set-up commentary which is easily localized), Just for Laughs: Gags has been purchased for use in over 100 countries throughout the world as well as in airports and by airlines. Reactions to the gags range from \"inane\"Keyan Tomaselli Cultural Tourism and Identity: Rethinking Indigeneity 2012 – Page 29 \"The inane Just for Laughs candid camera on the drop-down video screen is interspersed with silent movies on the … Mick Francis … responded to this note: \"as a Canadian I must apologize for the Just for Laughs show as it a strange Canadian export filmed in the late 1980s and mysteriously shown around the world\" (Francis, personal communication, October 2008)..\" to cross- culturally funny.Ray Wiss A Line in the Sand: Canadians at War in Kandahar 2010 Page 249 \"It was an episode of Gags from the Just for Laughs organization in Montreal. For those who have not seen this, it is reminiscent of Candid Camera: the comedians set up an outlandish situation on a city street or in a mall and capture people's reactions. The Afghans got the jokes and laughed as hard as I did.\" The same distributors also distribute Surprise Sur Prise, a similar show. thumb|200px|A gag on 'Just for Laughs' == Cast == This section requires specific casting related to Just for Laughs: Gags.\"Just for Laughs Gags Cast and Crew\" IMDb. * Claude Talbot; * Dany Many; * Denis Levasseur; * Denise Jacques; * Francis Gio Santiago; * Jack Martin; * Jacques Drolet; * Jean Guimond; * Jean Kohnen; * Jean-Pierre Alarie; * Jean Provencher; * Keith Law; * Kirsteen O'Sullivan; * Marie-Andrée Poulin; * Marie-Ève Larivière; * Marie-Pierre Bouchard; * Nadja David; * Pascal Babin; * Philippe Bond; * Richard Ledoux; * Sonia Butterworth; * Ted Pluviose. == Pranks == In the opening of each prank, the actors introduce how the prank was done and how it will be shown as well.

Good ratings during the summer airings in 2007 and a writer's union strike resulted in ABC adding the show to the network lineup as a mid-season replacement for 2007-2008. It returned to the schedule on 1 January 2008, before being canceled on 12 May 2008. However, on 4 June 2009, it was announced that a third season would begin airing on 21 June 2009. Program Partners brought the show back to the United States for a fourth season beginning in fall 2015; this season aired in first-run syndication.\"NATPE 2015: Fall 2015 Syndication; Buzzr TV: New Game Show Multicast Network Launches This Summer\" from Sitcoms Online (22 January 2015) ===Seasonal Nielsen ratings=== Seasonal ratings based on average total viewers per episode of Just for Laughs on ABC: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background-color:#E0E0E0\" ! | Season ! | Episodes ! | Timeslot (EDT) ! | Season Premiere ! | Season Finale ! | TV Season ! | Rank ! | Viewers (in millions) |- style=\"background-color:#F9F9F9\" ! style=\"background:#F9F9F9;text-align:center\" | 1 | style=\"font-size:13px;text- align:center\" |17 ! style=\"background:#F9F9F9;font-size:12px;font- weight:normal;text-align:left;line-height:110%\" | Tuesday 8:00 PM | 17 July 2007 | 6 November 2007 | style=\"font-size:11px;text-align:center\" |2006-2007 ! style=\"text-align:center\" | #111 | style=\"text-align:center\" | 7.06 |- style=\"background-color:#F9F9F9\" ! style=\"background:#F9F9F9;text- align:center\" | 2 | style=\"font-size:13px;text-align:center\" |14 ! style=\"background:#F9F9F9;font-size:12px;font-weight:normal;text- align:left;line-height:110%\" | Tuesday 8:00 PM | 1 January 2008 | 1 April 2008 | style=\"font-size:11px;text-align:center\" |2007-2008 ! style=\"text- align:center\" | #156 | style=\"text-align:center\" | 4.93 |- style=\"background- color:#F9F9F9\" ! style=\"background:#F9F9F9;text-align:center\" | 3 | style=\"font-size:13px;text-align:center\" |4 ! style=\"background:#F9F9F9;font- size:12px;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;line-height:110%\" | Sunday 7:30 PM | 21 June 2009 | 12 July 2009 | style=\"font-size:11px;text-align:center\" |2008-2009 ! style=\"text-align:center\" | #150 | style=\"text-align:center\" | 3.90 |} ====Season 1 (2007)==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
