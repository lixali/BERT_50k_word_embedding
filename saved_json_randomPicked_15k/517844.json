 "text": "is a Japanese animation studio. It has produced numerous series, including RahXephon, No. 6, Wolf's Rain, Scrapped Princess, Eureka Seven, Angelic Layer, Darker than Black, Soul Eater, Ouran High School Host Club, both the 2003 and 2009 adaptations of Fullmetal Alchemist, Star Driver, Gosick, Mob Psycho 100, Space Dandy, Noragami, Bungo Stray Dogs, and My Hero Academia. Its headquarters are located in Igusa, Suginami, Tokyo. ==History== Bones was founded by Sunrise staff members Masahiko Minami, Hiroshi Ōsaka and Toshihiro Kawamoto in October 1998. One of their first projects was collaborating with Sunrise on Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door, a feature film based on the Cowboy Bebop anime series. In 2007, the studio suffered the loss of co- founder Hiroshi Ōsaka, well known for his works as character designer on series such as Mobile Suit Victory Gundam, Mobile Fighter G Gundam and The Mars Daybreak. Ōsaka had been battling with cancer, and died from the disease on September 24, 2007. He was 44 years old. Since the death of Ōsaka, two new additions have been made to the studio's board of directors: Makoto Watanabe and Takahiro Komori. Komori is well known as a character designer and animator who has been with the studio since its inception. His previous works as designer consist of Angelic Layer, Scrapped Princess, and Darker than Black. ==Studios== Like studio Sunrise, where some of its founders previously worked, Bones is divided into smaller studios which are focused on their own anime projects. *Studio A: Led by producer Naoki Amano and mainly known for Gosick, Wolf's Rain, Angelic Layer, Hiwou War Chronicles, Noragami and Carole & Tuesday. *Studio B: Mainly known for Eureka Seven, RahXephon, Space Dandy, and Mob Psycho 100. *Studio C: Led by producer Yoshihiro Oyabu; It's known for Fullmetal Alchemist, Darker than Black: The Black Contractor, Soul Eater and Ouran High School Host Club. It's currently working exclusively for My Hero Academia. *Studio D: Led by Mari Suzuki and mainly known for Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and No. 6. Since 2015, it works on Bungo Stray Dogs. *Studio E: The newest studio, led by Makoto Watanabe and working on the new Eureka Seven movies since 2017. ==Productions== === Anime television series === {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" width=10 | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" | Director(s) ! scope=\"col\" | ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Note(s) |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2000–2001 | Hiwou War Chronicles || Tetsurō Amino || 26 || align=left | Original work; animated by Bones Studio A. |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2001 | Angelic Layer: Battle Doll || Hiroshi Nishikiori || 26 || align=left | Based on a manga by CLAMP; animated by Bones Studio A. |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2002 | RahXephon || Yutaka Izubuchi || 26 || align=left | Original work; animated by Bones Studio B. |- ! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | 2003 |Wolf's Rain || Tensai Okamura || 30 || align=left | Original work; animated by Bones Studio A. |- | Scrapped Princess || Sōichi Masui || 24|| align=left | Based on a light novel by Ichirō Sakaki; animated by Bones Studio B. |- ! scope=\"row\" |2003–2004 | Fullmetal Alchemist || Seiji Mizushima || 51|| align=left | Based on a manga by Hiromu Arakawa; animated by Bones Studio C.
