 "text": "Scaphocephaly is a type of cephalic disorder which occurs when there is a premature fusion of the sagittal suture. The sagittal suture joins together the two parietal bones of the skull. Scaphocephaly is the most common of the craniosynostosis conditions and is characterized by a long, narrow head. ==Treatment== This condition can be corrected by surgery if the child is young enough. The use of a cranial remolding orthosis can also benefit the child if the child begins wearing it at an early age. ==Terminology== The term is from Greek skaphe meaning 'light boat or skiff' and kephale meaning 'head') describes a specific shape of a long narrow head that resembles an inverted boat. ==See also== * Dolichocephaly ==References== == External links == * NINDS Overview Category:Congenital disorders of musculoskeletal system",
