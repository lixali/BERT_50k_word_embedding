 "text": "Giovanni Paolo Panini or Pannini (17 June 1691 – 21 October 1765) was a painter and architect who worked in Rome and is primarily known as one of the vedutisti (\"view painters\"). As a painter, Panini is best known for his vistas of Rome, in which he took a particular interest in the city's antiquities. Among his most famous works are his view of the interior of the Pantheon (on behalf of Francesco Algarotti), and his vedute—paintings of picture galleries containing views of Rome. Most of his works, especially those of ruins, have a fanciful and unreal embellishment characteristic of capriccio themes. In this they resemble the capricci of Marco Ricci. Panini also painted portraits, including one of Pope Benedict XIV. ==Biography== As a young man, Panini trained in his native town of Piacenza, under Giuseppe Natali and Andrea Galluzzi, and with stage designer Francesco Galli-Bibiena. In 1711, he moved to Rome, where he studied drawing with Benedetto Luti. In Rome, Panini earned a name for himself as a decorator of palaces. Some of his works included the Villa Patrizi (1719–1725), the Palazzo de Carolis (1720), and the Seminario Romano (1721-1722). In 1719, Panini was admitted to the Congregazione dei Virtuosi al Pantheon. He taught in Rome at the Accademia di San Luca and the Académie de France, where he is said to have influenced Jean-Honoré Fragonard. In 1754, he served as the prince (director) of the Accademia di San Luca. The Spanish monarchs appreciated his work in such a way that, commissioned by Filippo Juvarra, he sent paintings to decorate the Lacquer Room of the Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso. In addition, King Carlos IV, when he was Prince, bought several of his works that are still preserved in the Prado Museum and in the royal palaces. Panini died in Rome on 21 October 1765.Anna Maria Ferrari. \"Panini, Giovanni Paolo.\" Grove Art Online.

His style influenced other vedutisti, such as his pupils Antonio Joli and Charles-Louis Clérisseau, as well as Canaletto and Bernardo Bellotto, who sought to meet the need of visitors for painted \"postcards\" depicting the Italian environs. Some British landscape painters, such as Marlow, Skelton and Wright of Derby, also imitated his capricci. In addition to being a painter and architect, Panini was a professor of perspective and optics at the French Academy of Rome. His masterful use of perspective was later the inspiration for the creation of the \"Panini Projection\", which is instrumental in rendering panoramic views. Panini's works are held in the permanent collections of many museums worldwide, including the Prado Museum, the Louvre, the Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte, the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, the Hermitage, the Pushkin Museum, the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart, the Staatliche Museen, the Palazzo del Quirinale, the Toledo Museum of Art, the University of Michigan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Saint Louis Art Museum, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, the Getty Center, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, the Walters Art Museum, the Harvard Art Museums, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Indianapolis Museum of Art. ==Gallery== ===History paintings=== <gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px> File:Giovanni Paolo Pannini - Expulsion of the Moneychangers from the Temple - WGA16968.jpg|Expulsion of the Moneychangers from the Temple (ca. 1724), oil on canvas, 74 x 99 cm., Thyssen- Bornemisza Museum File:Giovanni Paolo Panini The Wedding at Cana, about 1725.jpg|The Wedding at Cana (ca. 1725), oil on canvas, 99.2 × 137.2 cm., Speed Art Museum File:Giovanni Paolo Panini (1691-1765) - Marcus Curtius Leaping into the Gulf - 207 - Fitzwilliam Museum.jpg|Marcus Curtius Leaping into the Gulf (no date), oil on canvas, 73.7 x 98.1 cm., Fitzwilliam Museum File:Museo diocesano (Milan) Giovanni Paolo Pannini, Apollo e Marsia (cropped).jpg|Apollo and Mars (no date), oil on canvas, Diocesan Museum of Milan ===Capriccios=== <gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px> File:Giovanni Paolo Pannini - Capriccio of Classical Ruins - WGA16965.jpg|Capriccio of Classical Ruins (ca. 1725-30), oil on canvas, 123 x 132 cm., private collection File:Giovanni Paolo Pannini - Landscape with the Arch of Titus - M.Ob.41 - National Museum in Warsaw.jpg|Landscape with the Arch of Titus (1725-50), oil on canvas, 51 x 76 cm., National Museum, Warsaw File:Giovanni Paolo Panini - Roman Capriccio, The Colosseum and Other Monuments - 50.6 - Indianapolis Museum of Art.jpg|Roman Capriccio: The Colosseum and Other Monuments (1735), oil on canvas, 98.4 x 133 cm., Indianapolis Museum of Art File:Giovanni Paolo Panini (1691-1765) - Capriccio of Roman Ruins with the Colosseum - PD.107-1992 - Fitzwilliam Museum.jpg|A Capriccio of Roman Ruins (1737), oil on canvas, 36.8 x 69.2 cm., Fitzwilliam Museum File:Giovanni Paolo Panini - Fantasy View with the Pantheon and other Monuments of Ancient Rome - 61.62 - Museum of Fine Arts.jpg|Fantasy View with the Pantheon and other Monuments of Ancient Rome (1737), oil on canvas, 99 x 137.5 cm., Museum of Fine Arts, Houston File:Giovanni Paolo Pannini - St Sibyl's Sermon in Roman Ruins with the Statue of Apollo, 1740s.jpg|St Sibyl's Sermon in Roman Ruins with the Statue of Apollo (1740s), oil on canvas, 81 x 125 cm., Hermitage Museum File:Giovanni Paolo Panini - A Capriccio of the Roman Forum - 1964.41 - Yale University Art Gallery.jpg|A Capriccio of the Roman Forum (1741), oil on canvas, 170.8 x 217.8 cm., Yale University Art Gallery File:Giovanni Paolo Panini - An Architectural Capriccio of the Roman Forum with Philosophers and Soldiers among Ancient Ruins, in... - Google Art Project.jpg|Architectural Capriccio of the Roman Forum with Philosophers and Soldiers (1745-50), oil on canvas, 98.4 x 135 cm., National Museum of Western Art ===Veduta (contemporary Rome)=== <gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px> File:Giovanni Paolo Pannini - Piazza Navona in Rome - WGA16976.jpg|Piazza Navona in Rome (1729), oil on canvas, 107 x 248 cm., Louvre File:St-peters-basilica-interior- pannini-1735.jpg|The Nave of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican (1735), oil on canvas, 153 x 219.7 cm., Norton Simon Museum File:Pannini, Giovanni Paolo - Interior of the San Giovanni in Laterano in Rome - 18th c.jpg|Interior of the San Giovanni in Laterano in Rome (no date), oil on canvas, 74 x 100 cm., Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts File:Lotteria in piazza di Montecitorio.jpg|Lotteria in Piazza di Montecitorio (1743), oil on canvas, collection unknown File:Lottery in Piazza di Montecitorio, oil on canvas,.jpg|Lotteria in Piazza di Montecitorio (no date), oil on canvas, collection unknown File:Pannini - La Remise de l'ordre du Saint-Esprit au prince Vaini par le duc de Saint-Aignan en l'église Saint-Louis-des-Français, le 15 septembre 1737.jpg|The delivery of the Order of the Holy Spirit to Prince Vaini by the Duke of Saint-Aignan in the Saint-Louis-des-Français church, September 15, 1737 (ca. 1745), oil on canvas, 72 x 98 cm., Musée des Beaux-Arts de Caen File:Pannini, Giovanni Paolo - Musical Fête - 1747.png|Musical feast given by the cardinal de La Rochefoucauld in the Teatro Argentina in Rome in 1747 on the occasion of the marriage of Dauphin, son of Louis XV (1747), oil on canvas, 207 x 247 cm., Louvre File:Giovanni Paolo Pannini - View of Rome from Mt.
