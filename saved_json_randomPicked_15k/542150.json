He died during an exchange of fire in the city of Herat between supporters of Zahir Nayebzada, a commander for the central government, and Ismail Khan. Nayebzada claimed responsibility for the assassination, but insisted that Sadiq had only been killed in self-defense. President Hamid Karzai later said Sadiq's death was caused by a \"small accident.\" ==References== Category:1973 births Category:2004 deaths Category:Assassinated Afghan politicians Category:Aviation ministers of Afghanistan",
