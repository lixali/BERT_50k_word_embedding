It is the northernmost district of the South East England Region. It was originally one of five non-metropolitan districts of Buckinghamshire, but on 1 April 1997, under a recommendation of the Local Government Commission for England, it became a self-governing non-metropolitan county, independent from (the former) Buckinghamshire County Council. The Borough abuts Bedfordshire, Northamptonshire and the remainder of Buckinghamshire that is under the control of Buckinghamshire Council. The principal built-up area in the borough is the Milton Keynes urban area, which accounts for about 20% of its area and 90% of its population. ==History== The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, by the merger of Bletchley Urban District, Newport Pagnell Urban District and Wolverton Urban District, together with Newport Pagnell Rural District and that part of Wing Rural District within the designated New Town area. The district council applied for and received borough status that year. ==Local government== Arising from the local government elections of May 2016, Milton Keynes council is under no overall control; the Labour Party and Conservative Party both hold 22 seats each with the Liberal Democrats holding 13 seats. The UK Independence party lost their only seat on the council to date in the 2016 local elections. Continuing as of May 2015, the Borough is governed by a Labour minority administration The Conservative Party is currently the main opposition group. Following the 2016 United Kingdom local elections the political composition for the council is as follows. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Conservatives !! Labour !! Liberal Democrats !! Other Parties |- | 22 || 22 || 13 || 0 |- |} The 2016 local election did not change the status of the Council from 'no overall control'.
