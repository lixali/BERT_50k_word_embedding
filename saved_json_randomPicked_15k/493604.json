At its completion five years later, it became the tallest free-standing structure in the Federal Republic of Germany. With its height of , Europaturm became Germany's second tallest structure, after the Fernsehturm Berlin (). Even without the height of the antenna at its top, the building is over high, which makes it Germany's tallest structure by roof level. Its base, at thick, is the widest of any similar structure in the world. The top of the tower can turn and provides a panoramic view of the Rhine Main area. For a number of years, the upper part of the structure housed a restaurant and discoth√®que, but since 1999, the Europaturm has been closed to the public. In September, 2004, the antenna at the top of the tower was replaced, increasing its total height to . The six-ton antenna was lifted to the top in two parts by helicopter. ==Broadcast capability== thumb|left|upright|Europaturm With the new antenna, the tower became capable of broadcasting high-definition digital television signals using the DVB-T standard (which is the European counterpart to the ATSC digital standard used in the United States). It is capable of broadcasting four channels per transmitter, for a total of twenty-four channels, at 100 kilowatts per channel. It is capable of receiving satellite broadcasts and redistributing them via cable or terrestrial broadcasts. The tower is owned and operated by T-Systems, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom. At night, it is illuminated with magenta lighting, the company's corporate colours. Among Frankfurt's residents, the tower is colloquially known as the \"Ginnemer Spaschel\" (Frankfurt dialect for \"The Ginnheimer Asparagus\", or \"Ginnheimer Spargel\" in standard German), even though it is located in the Bockenheim district rather than close by Ginnheim. It is also simply called the \"Fernsehturm\" (\"Television Tower\"). ==Elevator test tower== Since around 2002 a small elevator company has used the tower for testing and demonstrations.Press release 06.11.2002 Schindler presents new high- performance elevator ==See also== * List of towers * List of tallest freestanding structures in the world == References == ==External links== * Europaturm in SKYLINE ATLAS * * Europaturm at Building Database Phorio Category:Towers completed in 1979 Category:Observation towers in Hesse Category:Communication towers in Germany Category:Buildings and structures in Frankfurt Category:Restaurant towers Category:1979 establishments in West Germany",
