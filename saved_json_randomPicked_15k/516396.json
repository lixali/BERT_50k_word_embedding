 "text": "The 1919 Quebec general election was held on June 23, 1919, to elect members of the 15th Legislative Assembly of Quebec, Canada. The incumbent Quebec Liberal Party, led by Lomer Gouin, was re-elected, defeating the Quebec Conservative Party, led by Arthur Sauvé. Gouin, who had held office since 1905, resigned precisely one year after the election to make way for his successor Louis-Alexandre Taschereau. Gouin himself had originally come to power in much the same way, after his predecessor Simon-Napoléon Parent resigned soon after winning his final election. ==Results== {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse border-color: #444444\" |- bgcolor=\"darkgray\" !rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party !rowspan=\"2\"|Party leader !rowspan=\"2\"|# of candidates !colspan=\"3\"|Seats !colspan=\"3\"|Popular Vote |- bgcolor=\"darkgray\" |align=\"center\"|1916 |align=\"center\"|Elected |align=\"center\"|% Change |align=\"center\"|# |align=\"center\"|% |align=\"center\"|% Change | Lomer Gouin |align=\"right\"|99 |align=\"right\"|75 !align=\"right\"|74 |align=\"right\"|-1.3% |align=\"right\"|67,292 |align=\"right\"| 51.91% |align=\"right\"|-8.66% | Arthur Sauvé |align=\"right\"| 22 |align=\"right\"| 6 !align=\"right\"| 5 |align=\"right\"| -16.7% |align=\"right\"|21,990 |align=\"right\"|16.96% |align=\"right\"| -18.13% |Parti ouvrier | |align=\"right\"|6 |align=\"right\"|- !align=\"right\"|2 |align=\"right\"| |rowspan=2 align=\"right\"|40,354 |rowspan=2 align=\"right\"| 31.13% |rowspan=2 align=\"right\"|+26.8% |colspan=2|Independent Liberal |align=\"right\"|7 |align=\"right\"|- !align=\"right\"|- |align=\"right\"|- |- |colspan=\"3\"|Total !align=\"right\"|135 |align=\"right\"|81 !align=\"right\"|81 !align=\"right\"|- !align=\"right\"|129,636 !align=\"right\"|100% |align=\"right\"| |- |} ==See also== * List of Quebec premiers * Politics of Quebec * Timeline of Quebec history * List of Quebec political parties * 15th Legislative Assembly of Quebec ==Further reading== * Quebec general election Category:Elections in Quebec General election Quebec general election",
