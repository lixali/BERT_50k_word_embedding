 "text": "My Life Without Me is a 2003 Spanish-Canadian drama film directed by Isabel Coixet and starring Sarah Polley, Mark Ruffalo, Scott Speedman, and Leonor Watling. Based on the 1997 short story collection Pretending the Bed Is a Raft by Nanci Kincaid, it tells a story of a 23-year-old woman, with a husband and two daughters, who finds out she is going to die soon. The film is an El Deseo and My Life Productions co-production. ==Plot== Ann (Sarah Polley) is a hard- working 23-year-old mother with two small daughters, an unemployed husband (Scott Speedman), a mother (Deborah Harry) who sees her life as a failure, and a jailed father whom she has not seen for ten years. Her life changes dramatically when, during a medical checkup following a collapse, she is diagnosed with metastatic ovarian cancer and told that she has only two months to live. Deciding not to tell anyone of her condition and using the cover of anemia, Ann makes a list of things to do before she dies. She decides to change her hair, record birthday messages for the girls for every year until they're 18, and tries to set up her husband with another woman. Feeling a longing to experience a life that was never available to her, she seeks out a man to experience how it feels to be in a sexual relationship with someone other than her husband. Her experiment ends up taking an emotional toll when she meets with a man named Lee, who ends up madly in love with her and is left heartbroken when Ann breaks it off with him. He meets with her one last time and says that he will do anything to make her happy, taking care of her daughters and even finding her husband a new job. She ends their relationship and never tells him that she is dying. At the end of the film, Ann records a message to her husband, telling him that she loves him, and another one to Lee, telling him the same. She then leaves all tapes that she has recorded with her doctor, asking him to deliver them after her death. ==Cast== * Sarah Polley as Ann * Scott Speedman as Don, Ann's Husband * Mark Ruffalo as Lee, The Man With Whom Ann Has An Affair. * Deborah Harry as Ann's Mother * Jessica Amlee as Penny, Ann's Daughter * Kenya Jo Kennedy as Patsy, Ann's Daughter * Amanda Plummer as Laurie, Ann's Friend * Leonor Watling as Ann, The Neighbor * Maria de Medeiros as The Hairdresser * Julian Richings as Dr. Thompson * Alfred Molina as Ann's Father ==Reception== ===Box office=== The film was released on September 26, 2003 and ran for 12 weeks.
