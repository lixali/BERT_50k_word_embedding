Both projects featured a twin-boom layout with a rear-mounted engine driving pusher contra- rotating propellers. When the XP-59 project was cancelled the designation XP-59A was used as a cover for a secret jet fighter prototype, which would enter production as the P-59 Airacomet. ==XP-52== The XP-52 design was begun by the Bell Company in 1940, separate from the R-40C competition, under the Air Material Command designator MX-3. The short fuselage carried a piston engine in the rear, driving a pair of contra-rotating propellers in a pusher configuration. The wings were swept back at an angle of 20 degrees, with a horizontal stabilizer mounted behind the propeller on twin booms running back from the wings. The fuselage was unusually streamlined, being round and barrel-shaped, with the forward-located pilot's cockpit fully faired-in to its lines and the nose ending in a round air intake which was ducted back internally to the engine.Jones, L.; US Fighters, Aero, 1975. The undercarriage was a tricycle arrangement, with the main wheels retracting into the tailbooms. Propulsion was to be provided by the experimental Continental XIV-1430-3 inverted V-12 engine.Jenkins, Dennis R. and Tony R. Landis. Experimental & Prototype U.S. Air Force Jet Fighters. North Branch, Minnesota, USA: Specialty Press, 2008. . The XP-52 was cancelled in October 1940 because the XIV-1430 engine ran into technical difficulties. Bell submitted a similar design to the US Navy as the Model 19, but this too was never built.Buttler, Tony, and Griffith, Alan, 2015. American Secret Projects: Fighters, Bombers, and Attack Aircraft, 1937â€“1945. Manchester: Crecy Publishing. . ==XP-59== Although generally similar in layout to the XP-52, the XP-59 was slightly larger and heavier, and was to be powered by a Pratt and Whitney R-2800-23 engine of . Two prototypes were ordered in February 1941. On 3 October 1941 the contract for Bell's first jet fighter was signed. The prototype was designated the XP-59A and it would enter production as the P-59 Airacomet. The original XP-59 was cancelled on November 25, 1941 because Bell itself was pre- occupied with development of the Bell P-63 Kingcobra. ==See also== ==References== ==External links== * Bell XP-52 P-052 Category:Cancelled military aircraft projects of the United States Category:Twin-boom aircraft Category:Single-engined pusher aircraft Category:Aircraft with contra-rotating propellers",
