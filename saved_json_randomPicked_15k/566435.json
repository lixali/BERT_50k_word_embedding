Galena Summit marks the divide between the Big Wood River and Salmon River drainage areas. A little more than west of the summit is Galena Overlook, a scenic viewpoint at . It offers views of the Sawtooth range to the northwest and the headwaters of the Salmon River in the Stanley Basin of Custer County, which SH-75 follows north to Obsidian and Stanley, then east and north towards Challis. The overlook facilities were originally opened in 1964; it was renamed in 2006 for Frank and Bethine Church, and was renovated in 2010. The Galena Lodge (in historic Galena) is at , on the Ketchum side of the summit, and hosts cross country skiing. Collegiate alpine ski races were held on the summit in late 1947, due to a lack of snow at Sun Valley, and supplies were dropped in by airplane. The Ore- Ida Women's Challenge bicycle race (1984â€“2002) had a stage that crested the summit.
