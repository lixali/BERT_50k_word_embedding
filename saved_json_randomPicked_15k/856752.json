 "text": "thumb|The causeway to the settlement Eilean Dhomhnaill in Loch Olabhat Ian Armit identifies the islet of Eilean Dòmhnuill (, , \"The Isle of Donald\"), Loch Olabhat, on North Uist, Scotland, as what may be the earliest crannog. Unstan ware pottery found there suggests a Neolithic period date of 3200–2800 BC. A surrounding timber screen and the turf-walled houses seem to have been repeatedly taken down and rebuilt, and in the final phase two oblong stone- footed structures bear a resemblance to Knap of Howar on Papa Westray, Orkney. ==See also== * Prehistoric Scotland == References == * Ian Armit Scotland's Hidden History.
