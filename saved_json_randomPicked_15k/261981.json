After the falls, the water flows into the lake Lovatnet. The falls are easily reached by boat, sea plane, or road, and a campsite is located within hiking distance of the base of the falls. The total drop is from three free-leaping cascades. Due to the small flow of water it is one of the few major waterfalls in Norway that has not been slated for hydroelectric usage. The mountain, Ramnefjellet, has killed over 100 people as a result of major landslides in 1905 and 1936. A 2008 photograph of the falls taken from Lovatnet lake was included in the Emirates \"Skywards\" brochure. ==See also== *List of waterfalls by height ==References== ==External links== * The Lodal incident Category:Stryn Category:Tiered waterfalls Category:Waterfalls of Vestland",
