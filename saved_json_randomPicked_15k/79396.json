 "text": "The Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) is a collegiate athletic conference which operates in the Midwestern and Southeastern United States. It participates in Division I of the NCAA; the conference's football programs compete in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS; formerly known as Division I-AA), the lower of two levels of Division I football competition. The OVC has 10 members, 7 of which compete in football in the conference. ==History== Primary source: The Ohio Valley Conference can trace its roots to 1941 when Murray State athletic director Roy Stewart, Eastern Kentucky athletic director Charles \"Turkey\" Hughes, and Western Kentucky public relations director Kelly Thompson first formulated the idea of establishing a regional athletics conference. The plan was put on hold due to World War II, but it was resurrected after the conclusion of the war. In 1948, the three schools joined with Louisville, Morehead State, and Evansville to form the Ohio Valley Conference. While many collegiate conferences are struggling today with the question of whether their policies and rules should be determined by the athletic departments or by the institutional heads, from the very beginning, the OVC has been run by the presidents of its member schools. Historically, the OVC was a pioneer in racial desegregation, with Morehead State signing the conference's first black athlete, Marshall Banks, in 1958. The rest of the OVC soon followed in Morehead State's wake. From 1986 to 2018, the OVC was unique among NCAA Division I conferences in that it included one historically black university, Tennessee State University, in a conference that otherwise consists of institutions that are not traditionally black. During this period, every other HBCU in NCAA Division I belonged to either the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference or Southwestern Athletic Conference. That distinction changed in July 2018 when Hampton University joined the Big South Conference; that league has since added a second HBCU in North Carolina A&T; State University. The OVC has also been a leader in advancement of sports opportunities for women. The conference began adding championship competitions for women in 1977 several years after the AIAW began sponsoring national championships for women, but seven years before the NCAA was ready to move into the field. Since 2009, the OVC has been led by Commissioner Beth DeBauche, one of only six female commissioners for the thirty-two Division I conferences. Athletic rivalries, really close colleges and especially when competitors are in relatively close proximity, can generate problems with fan behavior, and the conference leadership struggled with controlling the issue for many years. When the national debate on the problem reached its apex in the mid-1990s, the OVC unveiled the national first of its kind \"Sportsmanship Statement\" in 1995, stating the conference's policy on, \"... principles of fair play, ethical conduct and respect for one's opponent.\" Since then, the OVC has also introduced individual, team (for each sport), and institutional sportsmanship awards. Founded by six schools, the expansions of 2007 and 2011 brought the Ohio Valley Conference membership to twelve schools, the most in its history. The OVC dropped to 10 members after the 2020–21 school year, when founding member Eastern Kentucky and Jacksonville State left for the ASUN Conference. The OVC is searching for teams to replace both in the near future. The OVC will lose three more members after the 2021–22 school year. Football-sponsoring Austin Peay will leave for the ASUN Conference, which plans to launch a football league of its own in 2022. Non-football Belmont will leave for the Missouri Valley Conference. Another football school, founding member Murray State, will leave for the MVC. When announcing its move to the MVC, Murray State announced that it was seeking membership in the football-only Missouri Valley Football Conference, and also announced that it would continue to house its rifle team in the OVC. In a separate statement, Murray State's president indicated that the football team would remain in the OVC in the 2022 season, ensuring that the OVC would retain its automatic bid to the FCS playoffs in that season and giving the league more time to add new football members. Also in July 2022, the OVC will add two non-football members in the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, athletically known as Little Rock, and the University of Southern Indiana, which will start a transition from NCAA Division II, plus a new football-sponsoring member in Lindenwood University, also transitioning from D-II. According to a report from Matt Brown of the Extra Points college sports blog, the OVC expected to lose Murray State, and was considering multiple expansion candidates, with Southern Indiana among them. Other schools named by Brown's sources as possible candidates were FCS programs Arkansas–Pine Bluff and Western Illinois, plus potential Division II upgraders Grand Valley State, Hillsdale, and Lincoln Memorial. On February 22, 2022, the conference announced its intent to combine its football membership with the Big South Conference beginning in 2023. Full details of the alliance, specifically whether it will be operated by either the Big South or OVC, or become a completely separate entity, have yet to be announced. ==OVC Digital Network== In August 2012, the OVC announced that it had launched the OVC Digital Network as a replacement for and improvement over the conference's former efforts to provide streaming video coverage of many athletic events that had been in place since 2006. This website carried live, student-produced coverage of most conference games and some non-conference games in baseball, men's and women's basketball, football, soccer, softball, and volleyball as well as some coaches' shows, special presentations, and archived game-casts available for later viewing. In its first two years, the network provided well over 600,000 viewings of streamed live video of more than 1400 events. In the 2018–19 school year the coverage previously carried on the OVC Digital Network was switched over to ESPN+. ==Member schools== ===Full members=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Institution !!

After four seasons as an Independent, the team joined the Pioneer Football League in 2001, and remained there through the 2005 season. Austin Peay then returned to scholarship football, spending the 2006 season as an Independent before re-entering OVC football competition in 2007. ==Conference divisions== Starting with the 2012–13 school year, the twelve member schools were split into two divisions for those sports where all schools competed. In the 2014–15 season, women's sports with twelve teams returned to a single league table, while continuing to play a divisional schedule. Men's basketball moved to an 18-game schedule in 2017–18, and they continued to play home-and-home versus the former divisional rivals, and they play home-and-home versus two teams from the other division, with those opponents on a rotation that sets up different pairs from year-to-year. The OVC returned to a single-table format after Eastern Kentucky and Jacksonville State left in 2021. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !East Division !West Division |- |Belmont |Austin Peay |- |Eastern Kentucky |Eastern Illinois |- |Jacksonville State |Murray State |- |Morehead State |SIU Edwardsville |- |Tennessee State |Southeast Missouri |- |Tennessee Tech |UT Martin |} ==Sports offered== The Ohio Valley Conference currently offers championship competition in 19 NCAA sanctioned sports, with eight for men, 10 for women, and rifle for men's, women's, and coed teams. {| class=\"wikitable\" style= |+ Teams in OVC competition !Sport||Men's||Women's||Coed |- | Baseball || || || |- | Basketball || || || |- | Beach Volleyball || || || |- | Cross Country || || || |- | Football || || || |- | Golf || || || |- | Rifle || || || |- | |Soccer || || || |- | Softball || || || |- | Tennis || || || |- | |Track and Field (Indoor) || || || |- | Track and Field (Outdoor) || || || |- | Volleyball (Indoor) || || || |} ===Men's sponsored sports by school=== Departing members are displayed in red. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\" |- !
