 "text": "The Rhino (Aleksei Sytsevich; English: Ah-lek-see set-seh-vich; Russian: Алексей Сицевич) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He was created by writer Stan Lee and artist John Romita Sr., and first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #41 (Oct. 1966). The character is a Russian thug who underwent an experimental procedure that gave him an artificial skin covering and superhuman strength. Rebelling against the scientists responsible for his transformation, Rhino used his newfound powers to become a successful criminal, and soon clashed with superheroes like Spider-Man and the Hulk. The character is typically portrayed as a dimwitted brute, capable of great destruction, but ultimately easily deceived. One of Spider-Man's most prominent adversaries, the Rhino has been adapted into various forms of media since his original debut during the Silver Age of Comic Books, including animated television series and video games. He has also featured in Marvel merchandise such as action figures and trading cards. Paul Giamatti played a version of Aleksei Sytsevich who uses a rhinoceros-themed battle armor, similar to the character's Ultimate Marvel incarnation, in the 2014 film The Amazing Spider-Man 2. ==Publication history== Described by writer Mike Conroy as \"famously one of Spider-Man's dimmest villains\",Conroy, Mike. 500 Comicbook Villains, Collins & Brown, 2004. the Rhino debuted in The Amazing Spider-Man #41–43 (Oct.–Dec. 1966) as a thug for hire working for an Eastern Bloc country. He volunteers to participate in an experiment that bonds a super-strong polymer to his skin, as well as augmenting his strength and speed. The character returned in The Incredible Hulk (vol. 2) #104 (June 1968), and although he apparently died at the end of the story, he was revived in The Incredible Hulk (vol. 2) #124 (Feb. 1970), becoming a perennial opponent of both Spider-Man and the Hulk. The character achieved significant exposure in the 1980s and 1990s, appearing in both a solo capacity and as a villain for hire in over 12 titles. Significant appearances included starring in the limited series Deadly Foes of Spider-Man #1–4 (May–Aug. 1991); the \"Flowers for Rhino\" storyline in Spider-Man's Tangled Web #5–6 (Oct.–Nov. 2001), which is told from the character's perspective; and Punisher War Journal (vol. 2) #13–15 (Jan.–March 2008), in which Rhino begins to rethink his lifestyle. He has also been a member of multiple supervillain teams, including the Emissaries of Evil, the Sinister Syndicate, and the Sinister Six. ==Fictional character biography== === Origin and early villainy === Aleksei Sytsevich was a member of the Russian mafia who willingly underwent a series of chemical and radiation treatments meant to give him an artificial skin covering that would grant superhuman strength. After successfully completing the treatment, Sytsevich rebelled against the Eastern Bloc agents who gave him these powers, destroying their laboratory. He was subsequently hired to kidnap Colonel John Jameson and obtain the extraterrestrial spores to which Jameson was exposed during a space mission, but Sytsevich was defeated by the superhero Spider-Man and taken to prison.The Amazing Spider-Man #41–43 (Oct. – Dec. 1966) After serving his sentence, the Rhino was approached by the same scientists for more augmentation. This time, they used the same gamma radiation that granted the Hulk his abilities to further increase the Rhino's strength. They also equipped him with a more durable, acid-proof suit that would further increase his abilities. The Rhino agreed to find and kidnap Bruce Banner, the Hulk's human alter ego, for his knowledge of gamma radiation. Despite the Rhino's training and equipment, he was easily defeated by the Hulk, who placed him in a coma.The Incredible Hulk (vol. 2) #104 (June 1968) Months later, the Rhino was revived by the Leader, who planned to interrupt Banner's wedding to Betty Ross. The Leader intended to transform Banner into the Hulk, and wanted the Rhino to protect him from the ensuing rampage. At the wedding, the Rhino betrays the Leader and attacks Banner the moment he transforms.The Incredible Hulk (vol. 2) #124 (Feb. 1970) In the resulting chaos, the Rhino is once again comatose, and the Leader briefly takes mental control of Sytsevich's body to combat the Hulk.The Incredible Hulk (vol. 2) #157–159 (Nov. 1972 – Jan. 1973) The Leader abandons the Rhino and the Hulk on an alien world, and return home in a rocket, which crashes on arrival.

He and the Thing successfully stopped Miracle Man, and took the Rhino to a medical facility within P.E.G.A.S.U.S.Thing #24 (June 1985) When the treatments fail to return the Rhino to normal, he escapes P.E.G.A.S.U.S. and joins the Sinister Syndicate, fighting Spider-Man on multiple occasions.Amazing Spider-Man #280–281 (Sep. – Oct. 1986) After the team falls apart, the Rhino is hired by the Kingpin under the belief that he can raise the money for more surgery.

His superhuman speed allows him to run at high velocities, especially over short distances. Sytsevich frequently \"charges\" his opponents in this manner, enabling him to cause great harm to most enemies in the surrounding area. The Rhino is, however, notorious for his lack of agility and slow reaction time, which makes it difficult for him to change direction when running at high speeds. As such, his fighting style is focused more on melee attacks. ===Rhino suit=== Sytsevich possesses a thick polymer suit that resembles the physique of a rhinoceros, including two horns, and covers everything but his face. The suit is resistant to damage and extreme temperatures and the horns are capable of penetrating two-inch plate steel. His first, cruder suit was originally bonded to his skin in the aftermath of a rocket crash and he went through several attempts to have the suit removed. After the first suit's destruction, Justin Hammer created a second, removable iteration. The second suit allows Sytsevich to withstand most high-caliber bullets, extreme temperatures, and impact forces.
