In Philippopolis, they anathemized the term homoousios, in effect excommunicating Pope Julius I as well as their rivals at the Council in Sardica, and introduced the term Anomoian and as a result, the Arian controversy was perpetuated, rather than resolved, as was the original intention of the Roman emperors Constans and ConstantiusSocrates Scholasticus, Church History, book 2, chapter 20. along with Pope Julius who called the Council of Sardica. Serdica is now called Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. Philippopolis is now called Plovdiv, Bulgaria's second largest city. ==References== ==Bibliography== *Sacred Texts, Early Church Fathers - Chapter XX Of the Council at Sardica Philippopolis Category:Arianism Category:History of Plovdiv Category:344 Category:340s in the Roman Empire",
