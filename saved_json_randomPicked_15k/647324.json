 "text": "An accredited or sophisticated investor is an investor with a special status under financial regulation laws. The definition of an accredited investor (if any), and the consequences of being classified as such, vary between countries. Generally, accredited investors include high-net-worth individuals, banks, financial institutions, and other large corporations, who have access to complex and higher-risk investments such as venture capital, hedge funds, and angel investments. Laws may require that some types of financial offerings may only be made to accredited investors. ==Criteria for accreditation== ===Australia=== s 708(8) of the Corporations Act 2001 is found in Chapter 6D (Fundraising). It defines \"sophisticated investor\" so as to exclude them from certain disclosure requirements. That section provides for an accountant to issue a certificate stating that an individual meets the criteria prescribed in the Corporations Regulations 2001, namely net assets of at least $2.5 million, or a gross income for each of the last two financial years of at least $250,000. There is a second definition of \"sophisticated investor\" in s 761GA of the Corporations Act 2001 in Chapter 7 (Financial services and markets). It defines sophisticated investors so that they can be treated as wholesale (rather than retail) clients. According to ASIC, a person with a sophisticated investor certificate is a sophisticated investor for the purpose of Chapter 6D, and a wholesale client for the purpose of Chapter 7. ===Brazil=== On December 17, 2014, CVM issued the Instructions No. 554 and No. 555, which became effective from July 1, 2015 according to Mondaq. The definition of accredited investors under the United States SEC’s Regulation D are analogous in Brazil to the combination of two categories of investors, classified by the Comissão de Valores Mobiliários (CVM) as \"investidor profissional\" (professional investor) and \"investidor qualificado\" (qualified investor) under Instruction 539, articles 9-A and 9-B. ===Canada=== An \"Accredited Investor\" (as defined in NI 45 106) is: # a person registered under the securities legislation of a jurisdiction of Canada, as an adviser or dealer, other than a person registered solely as a limited market dealer under one or both of the Securities Act (Ontario) or the Securities Act (Newfoundland and Labrador); or # an individual registered or formerly registered under the securities legislation of a jurisdiction of Canada as a representative of a person referred to in paragraph (a); or # an individual who, either alone or with a spouse, beneficially owns financial assets having an aggregate realizable value that before taxes, but net of any related liabilities, exceeds $1,000,000; or # an individual whose net income before taxes exceeded $200,000 in each of the two most recent calendar years or whose net income before taxes combined with that of a spouse exceeded $300,000 in each of the two most recent calendar years and who, in either case, reasonably expects to exceed that net income level in the current calendar year; or # an individual who, either alone or with a spouse, has net assets of at least $5,000,000; or # a person, other than an individual or investment fund, that has net assets of at least $5,000,000 as shown on its most recently prepared financial statements; or # a trust company or trust corporation registered or authorized to carry on business under the Trust and Loan Companies Act (Canada) or under comparable legislation in a jurisdiction of Canada or a foreign jurisdiction, acting on behalf of a fully managed account managed by the trust company or trust corporation, as the case may be; or # an investment fund that distributes or has distributed its securities only to (i) a person that is or was an accredited investor at the time of the distribution, (ii) a person that acquires or acquired securities in the circumstances referred to in sections 2.10 of NI 45 106 [Minimum amount investment] or 2.19 of NI 45 106 [Additional investment in investment funds], or (iii) a person described in paragraph (i) or (ii) that acquires or acquired securities under section 2.18 of NI 45 106 [Investment fund reinvestment]; # a person acting on behalf of a fully managed account managed by that person, if that person is registered or authorized to carry on business as an adviser or the equivalent under the securities legislation of a jurisdiction of Canada or a foreign jurisdiction; or # a person in respect of which all of the owners of interests, direct, indirect or beneficial, except the voting securities required by law to be owned by directors, are persons that are accredited investors (as defined in NI 45 106); or # an investment fund that is advised by a person registered as an adviser or a person that is exempt from registration as an adviser. Note that as of 2016, many provinces in Canada now allow non-accredited investors to invest in private markets – under specified limits. ===European Union=== Retail clients requesting treatment as 'elective' professional clients (as defined by Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID)) must satisfy at least two of the following quantitative criteria in assessing the client's expertise, experience and knowledge: * the client has carried out trade transactions, in significant size (at least €50,000), on the relevant market at an average frequency of 10 per quarter over the previous four quarters; * the size of the client's financial instrument portfolio, defined as including cash deposits and financial instruments, exceeds €500,000; * the client works or has worked in the financial sector for at least one year in a professional position which requires knowledge of the transactions or services envisaged. ===Israel=== # An investment trust or fund manager. # A management company or Provident fund as defined in the Israeli Provident fund law. # An insurance company. # A banking corporation and auxiliary corporation as defined in the Israeli Banking law (Licensing), other than a joint services company. # A registered (licensed) investment adviser. # An exchange member. # An underwriter qualified to under section 56(c) of the Israel Securities Act. # Corporation (except a corporation incorporated for the purpose of receiving investment advisory services, investment marketing or portfolio management) with equity of more than ₪50 million.
