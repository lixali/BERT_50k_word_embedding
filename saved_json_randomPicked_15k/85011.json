 "text": "XPointer is a system for addressing components of XML-based Internet media. It is divided among four specifications: a \"framework\" that forms the basis for identifying XML fragments, a positional element addressing scheme, a scheme for namespaces, and a scheme for XPath-based addressing. XPointer Framework is a W3C recommendation since March 2003. The XPointer language is designed to address structural aspects of XML, including text content and other information objects created as a result of parsing the document. Thus, it could be used to point to a section of a document highlighted by a user through a mouse drag action. During development, and until 2016, XPointer was covered by a royalty-free technology patent held by Sun Microsystems. == Positional Element Addressing == The `element()` scheme introduces positional addressing of child elements. This is similar to a simple XPath address, but subsequent steps can only be numbers representing the position of a descendant relative to its branch on the tree. For instance, given the following fragment: results as the following examples: xpointer(id(\"foo\")) => foobar xpointer(/foobar/1) => bar xpointer(//bom) => bom (a=1), bom (a=2) element(/1/2/1) => bom (a=1) (/1 descend into first element (foobar), /2 descend into second child element (baz), /1 select first child element (bom)) == See also == * URI fragment * HTML * HyTime * Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines * XML == References == == External links == * XPointer Framework * Namespacing * Path based addressing * XPointer patent terms and conditions * Open source implementation (CognitiveWeb) * GPL License .NET implementation (XInclude.NET) * Method and system for implementing hypertext scroll attributes on Google Patents, expired 2016-02-01 Category:World Wide Web Consortium standards Category:XML data access",
