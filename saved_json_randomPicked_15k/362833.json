 "text": "Jamie and the Magic Torch is a British children's television series made by Cosgrove Hall for Thames Television and shown on the ITV network, running from 1976 to 1979. It was shown again in the 1980s to a new audience of children. The series was written and narrated by Brian Trueman, who later wrote shows such as Danger Mouse and Count Duckula for Cosgrove Hall. Jamie and the Magic Torch was aired in India on Doordarshan in the 1980s and 1990s. It was very popular among kids. ==Premise== The programme was based around the young boy of the title and his torch. When shone on the floor, the torch opened up a hole into a fun fantasy dimension called Cuckoo Land. The beginning of each episode had Jamie's mother tucking him into bed at night and saying, \"Sleep well, Jamie.\" Then from under his bed, his pet Old English Sheepdog Wordsworth would appear holding the torch in his mouth. Jamie would take the torch and shine it on the floor, opening up a portal to Cuckoo Land (which Wordsworth always got stuck in). The portal manifested itself as a helter skelter. When they reached the end of the slide, they would fly out into Cuckoo Land from the bottom of a tree trunk and land on a trampoline. All of this was accompanied by a song, written by Joe Griffiths. Once in Cuckoo Land, the fun would begin. ==Characters in Cuckoo Land== * Mr. Boo, who flies around in his 'submachine', obsessed with counting things. * Officer Gotcha, who rides a unicycle and eats truncheons. * Strumpers Plunkett, who plays melodies on his trumpet nose. * Wellibob the cat, who does everything backwards and speaks with a Glaswegian accent. * Jo-Jo Help the unhelpful handyman. * Nutmeg the ragdoll, whose magical pocket can produce all kinds of items. * The Yoo-hoo Bird, who plays tricks on and runs from Officer Gotcha. * Bullybundy, the show business rabbit with oversized feet. * Arthur, a robot (series 3 only). ==VHS releases== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
