 "text": ":TCID may also stand for \"Tissue Culture Infectious Dose.\" or \"4,5,6,7-Tetrachloro-1H-indene-1,3(2H)-dione\" The Truckee–Carson Irrigation District (TCID) is a political subdivision of the State of Nevada, which operates dams at Lake Tahoe, diversion dams on the Truckee River in Washoe County, and the Lake Lahontan reservoir. TCD also operates of canals, and of drains, in support of agriculture in Lyon County and Churchill County, western Nevada. The excess irrigation water eventually drains into the endorheic Lake Lahontan Basin. ==Endangered species== Diversion of water by the TCID from the Truckee River has caused a reduction in the level of natural Pyramid Lake, resulting in the endemic species of fish that live in it becoming endangered species. In the mid-1980s the United States Environmental Protection Agency initiated development of the DSSAM Model to analyze effects of variable Truckee River flow rates and water quality upon these endangered fish species. ==See also== * Derby Dam * Newlands Reclamation Act ==References== ==External links== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Water in Nevada Category:Historic American Engineering Record in Nevada Category:Irrigation Districts of the United States Category:Irrigation projects Category:Local government in Nevada Category:Agriculture in Nevada Category:Churchill County, Nevada Category:Lyon County, Nevada Category:Washoe County, Nevada",
