 "text": "In mathematics, the Fibonacci polynomials are a polynomial sequence which can be considered as a generalization of the Fibonacci numbers. The polynomials generated in a similar way from the Lucas numbers are called Lucas polynomials. ==Definition== These Fibonacci polynomials are defined by a recurrence relation:Benjamin & Quinn p. 141 :F_n(x)= \\begin{cases} 0, & \\mbox{if } n = 0\\\\\\ 1, & \\mbox{if } n = 1\\\\\\ x F_{n - 1}(x) + F_{n - 2}(x),& \\mbox{if } n \\geq 2 \\end{cases} The Lucas polynomials use the same recurrence with different starting values:Benjamin & Quinn p. 142 :L_n(x) = \\begin{cases} 2, & \\mbox{if } n = 0 \\\\\\ x, & \\mbox{if } n = 1 \\\\\\ x L_{n - 1}(x) + L_{n - 2}(x), & \\mbox{if } n \\geq 2. \\end{cases} They can be defined for negative indices bySpringer :F_{-n}(x)=(-1)^{n-1}F_{n}(x), :L_{-n}(x)=(-1)^nL_{n}(x). == Examples == The first few Fibonacci polynomials are: :F_0(x)=0 \\, :F_1(x)=1 \\, :F_2(x)=x \\, :F_3(x)=x^2+1 \\, :F_4(x)=x^3+2x \\, :F_5(x)=x^4+3x^2+1 \\, :F_6(x)=x^5+4x^3+3x \\, The first few Lucas polynomials are: :L_0(x)=2 \\, :L_1(x)=x \\, :L_2(x)=x^2+2 \\, :L_3(x)=x^3+3x \\, :L_4(x)=x^4+4x^2+2 \\, :L_5(x)=x^5+5x^3+5x \\, :L_6(x)=x^6+6x^4+9x^2 + 2. \\, == Properties == * The degree of Fn is n − 1 and the degree of Ln is n. * The Fibonacci and Lucas numbers are recovered by evaluating the polynomials at x = 1; Pell numbers are recovered by evaluating Fn at x = 2\\. * The ordinary generating functions for the sequences are: *: \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty F_n(x) t^n = \\frac{t}{1-xt-t^2} *: \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty L_n(x) t^n = \\frac{2-xt}{1-xt-t^2}. *The polynomials can be expressed in terms of Lucas sequences as *:F_n(x) = U_n(x,-1),\\, *:L_n(x) = V_n(x,-1).\\, *They can also be expressed in terms of Chebyshev polynomials \\mathcal{T}_n(x) and \\mathcal{U}_n(x) as *:F_n(x) = i^{n-1}\\cdot\\mathcal{U}_{n-1}(\\tfrac{-ix}2),\\, *:L_n(x) = 2\\cdot i^n\\cdot\\mathcal{T}_n(\\tfrac{-ix}2),\\, :where i is the imaginary unit. ==Identities== As particular cases of Lucas sequences, Fibonacci polynomials satisfy a number of identities, such as :F_{m+n}(x)=F_{m+1}(x)F_n(x)+F_m(x)F_{n-1}(x)\\, :L_{m+n}(x)=L_m(x)L_n(x)-(-1)^nL_{m-n}(x)\\, :F_{n+1}(x)F_{n-1}(x)- F_n(x)^2=(-1)^n\\, :F_{2n}(x)=F_n(x)L_n(x).\\, Closed form expressions, similar to Binet's formula are: :F_n(x)=\\frac{\\alpha(x)^n-\\beta(x)^n}{\\alpha(x)-\\beta(x)},\\,L_n(x)=\\alpha(x)^n+\\beta(x)^n, where :\\alpha(x)=\\frac{x+\\sqrt{x^2+4}}{2},\\,\\beta(x)=\\frac{x-\\sqrt{x^2+4}}{2} are the solutions (in t) of :t^2-xt-1=0.\\, For Lucas Polynomials n > 0, we have :L_n(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor} \\frac{n}{n-k} \\binom{n-k}{k} x^{n-2k}. A relationship between the Fibonacci polynomials and the standard basis polynomials is given byA proof is given starting from page 5 in . :x^n=F_{n+1}(x)+\\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor}(-1)^k\\left[\\binom nk-\\binom n{k-1}\\right]F_{n+1-2k}(x). For example, :x^4 = F_5(x)-3F_3(x)+2F_1(x)\\, :x^5 = F_6(x)-4F_4(x)+5F_2(x)\\, :x^6 = F_7(x)-5F_5(x)+9F_3(x)-5F_1(x)\\, :x^7 = F_8(x)-6F_6(x)+14F_4(x)-14F_2(x)\\, ==Combinatorial interpretation== thumb|right|360px|The coefficients of the Fibonacci polynomials can be read off from Pascal's triangle following the \"shallow\" diagonals (shown in red). The sums of the coefficients are the Fibonacci numbers. If F(n,k) is the coefficient of xk in Fn(x), so :F_n(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^n F(n,k)x^k,\\, then F(n,k) is the number of ways an n−1 by 1 rectangle can be tiled with 2 by 1 dominoes and 1 by 1 squares so that exactly k squares are used. Equivalently, F(n,k) is the number of ways of writing n−1 as an ordered sum involving only 1 and 2, so that 1 is used exactly k times. For example F(6,3)=4 and 5 can be written in 4 ways, 1+1+1+2, 1+1+2+1, 1+2+1+1, 2+1+1+1, as a sum involving only 1 and 2 with 1 used 3 times. By counting the number of times 1 and 2 are both used in such a sum, it is evident that F(n,k) is equal to the binomial coefficient :F(n,k)=\\binom{\\tfrac{n+k-1}{2}}{k} when n and k have opposite parity. This gives a way of reading the coefficients from Pascal's triangle as shown on the right. ==References== * * * * *Jin, Z. On the Lucas polynomials and some of their new identities.
