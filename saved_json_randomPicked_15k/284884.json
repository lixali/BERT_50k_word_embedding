Councils receive the majority of their funding from the Scottish Government,Local Government Overview Report 2009 (Exhibit 1, Page 7), Audit Scotland. through aggregate external finance (AEF). AEF consists of three parts: Revenue support grants, non-domestic rates, and income and specific grants.Core Revenue Funding, Scottish Executive website, accessed 28 April 2007. The level of central government support for each authority is determined by the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and the Constitution, currently Kate Forbes MSP, and is distributed by the Finance and Central Services Department of the Scottish Government. Councils obtain additional income through the Council Tax, that the council itself sets. Scottish councils co-operate through, and are represented collectively by, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA). ==History== ===Origins=== The history of Scottish local government mainly surrounds involves the counties of Scotland. The counties have their origins in the sheriffdoms or shires over which a sheriff (a contraction of shire reeve) exercised jurisdiction. Malcolm III appears to have introduced sheriffs as part of a policy of replacing native \"Celtic\" forms of government with Anglo Saxon and French feudal structures.John of Fordun wrote that Malcolm II introduced the shire to Scotland and also the thane class. Shires are certainly mentioned in charters by the reign of King Malcolm III, for instance that to the Church of Dunfermline, AD 1070–1093. This was continued by his sons Edgar, Alexander I and in particular David I. David completed the division of the country into sheriffdoms by the conversion of existing thanedoms.The earliest sheriffdom south of the Forth which we know of for certain is Haddingtonshire, which is named in a charters of 1139 as \"Hadintunschira\" (Charter by King David to the church of St. Andrews of the church of St. Mary at Haddington) and of 1141 as \"Hadintunshire\" (Charter by King David granting Clerchetune to the church of St. Mary of Haddington). In 1150 a charter refers to Stirlingshire (\"Striuelinschire\"). (Charter by King David granting the church of Clackmannan, etc., to the Abbey of Stirling.) From the seventeenth century the shires started to be used for local administration apart from judicial functions. In 1667 Commissioners of Supply were appointed in each sheriffdom to collect the land tax.The sheriffdoms listed were Edinburgh (i.e. Midlothian), Hadingtoun (i.e. East Lothian), Berwick, Roxburgh, Selkirk, Peebles, Lanerk, Dumfreize, \"the sherifdome of Wigtoun and stewartrie of Kirkcudbright\", Air, Dumbartan, Bute, Renfrew, Striviling (i.e. Stirlingshire), Linlithgow (i.e. West Lothian), Perth, Kincairdine, Aberdene, Inverness and Ross, Nairne, Cromarty, Argyle, Fyfe and Kinross, Forfar (i.e. Angus), Bamf (i.e. Banff), Sutherland, Caithnes, Elgine (i.e. Moray), Orkney and Zetland (i.e. Shetland), Clakmannan. The commissioners eventually assumed other duties in the county. In 1858, police forces were established in each county under the Police (Scotland) Act 1857. As a result of the dual system of local government, burghs (of which there were various types) often had a high degree of autonomy. ===Modern history=== Between 1890 and 1975 local government in Scotland was organised with county councils (including four counties of cities) and various lower-level units. Between 1890 and 1929, there were parish councils and town councils, but with the passing of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929, the functions of parish councils were passed to larger district councils and a distinction was made between large burghs (i.e. those with a population of 20,000 or more) and small burghs. This system was further refined by the passing of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1947. Effective from 1975, the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 passed by the Conservative government of Edward Heath introduced a system of two-tier local government in Scotland (see Local government areas of Scotland 1973 to 1996), divided between large regional councils and smaller district councils. The only exceptions to this were the three island councils, Western Isles, Shetland and Orkney which had the combined powers of regions and districts. The Conservative government of John Major (1990–1997) decided to abolish this system and merge their powers into new unitary authorities. The new councils vary wildly in size – some are the same as counties, such as Clackmannanshire, some are the same as former districts, such as Inverclyde, and some are the same as the former regions, such as Highland. The changes took effect in 1996 with shadow councillors elected in 1995 to oversee the smooth transition of control. In 2007, council elections moved to the single transferable vote system, with wards represented by either three or four councillors. The transition has resulted in no uncontested seats and has ended single-party controlled councils.Adopting the Single Transferable Votefor local elections in England Briefing of the Electoral Reform Society on the website electoral-reform.org.uk, May 2015.

In 2016 there were ward boundary changes in 25 local authority areas, following the Scottish Government accepting some of the recommendations of Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland. ==Responsibilities== * Council Tax * Non-domestic rates collection * Maintenance of all roads and pavements (except trunk roads which are the responsibility of Transport Scotland) * Primary and secondary schooling * The Planning System, and Section 75 * Parking * Bus stops * Supporting non- commercial bus services * Provides some Community Transport * Nurseries * Care of the elderly, * Protection of vulnerable children and adults * Refuse collection and disposal * Licensing of hours of sale for alcohol * Licensing of cultural music parades * Licensing of taxis and private hire vehicles * Licensing of window cleaners, market traders, scrap metal merchants, and street hawkers * Licensing of sexual entertainment venuesCivic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 Overview on the website legislation.gov.uk.

There are currently 1,227 councillors, each paid a part-time salary for the undertaking of their duties. In total, there are 32 unitary authorities, the largest being the City of Glasgow with more than 600,000 inhabitants, the smallest, Orkney, with just over 20,000 people living there (population of 21,670 in 2015). Councillors are subject to a Code of Conduct instituted by the Ethical Standards in Public Life etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 and enforced by the Standards Commission for Scotland.Ethical Standards in Public Life framework: If a person believes that a councillor has broken the code of conduct they make a complaint to the Commissioner for Ethical Standards in Public Life in Scotland (CESPLS). The Commissioner makes a determination on whether there is a need for an investigation, and then whether or not to refer the matter to the Standards Commission.Commissioner for Ethical Standards in Public Life in Scotland ===Convener (Provost)=== Each council elects a convener from among the members of the council to chair meetings and to act as a figurehead for the area.s.4, Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994. A council may also elect a depute convener, though this is not required. In the four city councils in Scotland – Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee – the convener is called a Lord Provost, whilst in other councils the council may choose another title for their conveners. Most councils use the term 'provost'. The office of provost or convener is roughly equivalent to that of a mayor in other parts of the United Kingdom. Traditionally these roles are ceremonial and have no significant administrative functions. Lord provosts in the four city councils have the additional duty of acting as Lord Lieutenant for their respective city. ===Leader of the Council=== The Leader of the Council is elected as the leader of the largest political grouping of councillors. The Leader of the Council has no executive or administrative powers designated by statute, but the position is salaried. There is also a Depute Leader of the Council appointed. Each political group within the council typically appoints a leader, with the largest grouping's leader becoming 'Leader of the Council', and being the central figure of de facto political authority. ===Officers=== Officers of a council are administrative, non-political staff of the council. Generally the composition of the council's officers are a matter for the council, but there are a number of statutory officers whose roles are defined by the central government. The most significant of these officers is the Head of Paid Service, usually titled the Chief Executive. The Chief Executive is similar in function to a city manager, though certain councillors have executive authority and there is no clear division of powers.http://www.gov.scot/library/documents3/ethic-07.htm There is also a statutory Monitoring Officer, who usually heads the Legal Services division of the council, as well as a Chief Financial Officer. ==2017 election results== Following boundary changes: |-style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9;text- align:center;\" !colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"175\"|Party !colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"175\"| First-preference votes ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Councils ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 30px;\"| +/- ! colspan=\"2\" | 2012 seats ! colspan=\"2\" | 2017 seats ! colspan=\"2\" | Seat change |- !

Comparisons with the actual results from 2012 are inconsistent, as the number of seats and seat changes will be different because of an increase in council seats across the country from 1,223 to 1,227 and the different boundaries. |-style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9;text- align:center;\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Party ! 2012 seats ! 2012 notional |- |- style=\"text-align:right;\" | style=\"background-color:\"| | style=\"text- align:left;\" |Scottish National Party |425 |438 |- |- style=\"text- align:right;\" | style=\"background-color:\"| | style=\"text-align:left;\" |Conservative |115 |112 |- |- style=\"text-align:right;\" | style=\"background- color:\"| | style=\"text-align:left;\" |Labour |394 |395 |- |- style=\"text- align:right;\" | style=\"background-color:\"| | style=\"text-align:left;\" |Liberal Democrats |71 |70 |- |- style=\"text-align:right;\" | style=\"background-color:\"| | style=\"text-align:left;\" |Scottish Greens |14 |14 |- |- style=\"text- align:right;\" | style=\"background-color:\"| | style=\"text-align:left;\" |Others |204 |198 |- |- ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |Total |1,223 |1,227 |- |} ===Council control=== Political control may be held by minority governments (min), coalitions (co), joint leadership arrangements (j.l.) or partnership working arrangements (p.w.).

This change in voting system saw all but five councils end up with no one party in control. Labour retained control of the City of Glasgow and North Lanarkshire, while Orkney, Shetland and Na h-Eileanan Siar continue to be controlled by Independent councillors. ===Council control=== The 32 unitary authorities are controlled as follows.

Local authorities have a statutory duty to consult community councils on planning, development and other issues directly affecting that local community. However, the community council has no direct say in the delivery of services. In many areas they do not function at all, but some work very effectively at improving their local area. Elections for community councils are determined by the local authority but the law does state that candidates cannot stand on a party- political ticket. ==See also== * 2022 Scottish local elections * List of political parties in Scotland * Subdivisions of Scotland * Local government in England * Local government in Northern Ireland * Local government in Wales * Business rates in Scotland * Local income tax * Convention of Scottish Local Authorities * Scottish Housing Regulator * Social care in Scotland * List of Scottish council areas by population ==Notes and references== ==External links== *Local Government Scottish Government *Local Government in Scotland *Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland *Map of the UK counties and unitary administrations *Map of all UK local authorities Category:Administrative divisions of Scotland",
