He reigned over the Isle of Mann until his death, then being succeeded by his son. ==Early life== At the age of thirteen, Edward received the titles and estates of his father, the 2nd Earl of Derby, and King Henry VIII took responsibility for bringing him up until he was of age. His commissioners, including Cardinal Thomas Wolsey were responsible for most of his affairs. In 1528, he accompanied Cardinal Wolsey on a mission to France, and in 1530, he was one of the peers who gave Pope Clement VII the declaration regarding Henry's divorce from Catherine of Aragon. ==Marriages and issue== That same year Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk bought the remaining year of Edward Stanley's wardship and married him, without the King's permission, to his daughter, Katherine Howard. The King rebuked Norfolk, but allowed the marriage. Katherine fell victim to the plague a few weeks later. Undeterred, Norfolk arranged for a marriage between his half sister, Dorothy Howard, and Edward Stanley,See also Zevin, E.M. \"A new wife for Edward, 3rd earl of Derby\" Transactions of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire, Vol. 134, 1984. with whom he had issue: * Henry Stanley, 4th Earl of Derby * Elizabeth (1533â€“1590) wife of Henry Parker, 11th Baron Morley * Jane (d.1569) wife of Edward Sutton, 4th Baron Dudley * Mary (d.1609) wife of Edward Stafford, 3rd Baron Stafford * Thomas, grandfather of Venetia Stanley * Anne, wife of Charles Stourton, 8th Baron Stourton, then of Sir John Arundell of Lanherne * Margaret (d.1585), widow of John Germin & 2nd wife of Sir Nicholas Poyntz (d.1585/6) of Iron Acton, Glos.Heralds' Visitation of Glos. 1623, p. 135, Poyntz ==Later career== In 1532, Edward accompanied King Henry to Boulogne, where they met with King Francis I of France. After this meeting, Edward became a Knight of the Bath. A few years later, Edward took a major role in quelling the Pilgrimage of Grace, a large (mainly church-related) rebellion started in Lincolnshire and spread into North England. In 1542, Edward accompanied the Duke of Norfolk on a raid into Scotland. When Edward VI ascended to the throne in 1547, Edward became a Knight of the Garter, and in 1550, he was one of the peers who were present at the peace proceedings with Scotland and France. A year later, various charges were brought against him (with little or no evidence), mainly due to his opposition to clerical reform. However, when Queen Mary ascended to the throne, he was again in favour, and was appointed Lord High Steward and became a Privy Councillor. He was a commissioner of Lady Jane Grey's trial, and was frequently present during the trials of accused heretics. He remained in favour under Queen Elizabeth I's reign, and remained on her Privy Council. She eventually appointed him Chamberlain of Chester. Edward Stanley died at Lathom House, and his titles and estates were passed on to his eldest son, Henry Stanley. ==Ancestry== ==Footnotes== ==References== * * ==External links== *Stanley's patronage of theater and/or music: Patrons and Performances Web Site |- |- |- Category:1509 births Category:1572 deaths Category:Knights of the Garter Category:Knights of the Bath Category:Lord High Stewards Category:Lord-Lieutenants of Cheshire Category:Lord-Lieutenants of Lancashire Edward Category:16th-century English nobility 3 Category:Monarchs of the Isle of Man Category:Barons Strange Category:Le Strange family Category:Barons Stanley",
