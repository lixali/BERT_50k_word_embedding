 "text": "True is the third studio album by English new wave band Spandau Ballet, released on 4 March 1983 by Chrysalis Records. While Spandau Ballet's first two albums earned them European popularity, True made them worldwide stars and was heavily influenced by jazz, soul and R&B.; It reached number one on the UK Albums Chart, number 19 on the US Billboard 200, and charted in numerous other countries around the world. The title track spent four weeks at number one on the UK Singles Chart and peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100. It was also Spandau Ballet's first album to be recorded outside of London (at Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas). Other singles from the album included \"Gold\" (number two in the UK and top 30 in the US), \"Lifeline\", \"Communication\", and \"Pleasure\". A remastered version of \"True\" was released on 3 July 2003 to commemorate its 20th anniversary. It was re-released as a single CD with the original eight tracks along with the music video for \"Gold\" and some home video footage of the band. The original 8-track album was also issued on the high-resolution super audio CD format as a Hybrid SACD (in stereo only). In 2008, the album was given away free with copies of the Daily Mail newspaper. In June 2010, a special edition was released on 2 CDs and DVD as part of the 2010 Spandau Ballet reissues series, featuring remastered 12″ remixes and B-sides, plus a live concert. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ===Spandau Ballet=== * Tony Hadley – lead and backing vocals * Gary Kemp – guitars, backing vocals * Martin Kemp – bass * John Keeble – drums * Steve Norman – percussion, saxophone ===Additional musician=== * Jess Bailey – keyboards ===Technical=== * Spandau Ballet – production * Steve Jolley – production * Tony Swain – production, engineering * Richard Lengyel – engineering assistance * Tim Young – mastering * David Band – art direction, illustration * Lynn Goldsmith – photography * Stephen Horsfall – typography * Mixed at Red Bus Studios (London) * Mastered at CBS Studios (London) ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Weekly chart performance for True ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1983) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (Kent Music Report) | 4 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ 1983 year-end chart performance for True |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1983) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (Kent Music Report) | 10 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Canada Top Albums/CDs (RPM) | 46 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Dutch Albums (Album Top 100) | 6 |- ! scope=\"row\"| German Albums (Offizielle Top 100) | 21 |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Albums (RMNZ) | 3 |- ! scope=\"row\"| UK Albums (Gallup) | 6 |} {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ 1984 year-end chart performance for True |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1984) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Canada Top Albums/CDs (RPM) | 80 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Dutch Albums (Album Top 100) | 46 |} ==Certifications== ==References== ===Bibliography=== * Category:1983 albums Category:Albums produced by Jolley & Swain Category:Chrysalis Records albums Category:Spandau Ballet albums",
