The nearby Kintai Bridge was originally a footbridge over the Nishiki River to the main gate of the castle. ==History== This castle was originally constructed by Kikkawa Hiroie from 1601 to 1608 as his own castle. Kikkawa was a retainer of a vassal of the Shōgun under the Mōri clan. However, this castle was dismantled as per the Ikkoku-ichijo (一国一城, literally, \"One Castle Per Province\") order established by the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1615. After the destruction of the castle, Kikkawa used a part of the old castle as his residential office. The Kikkawa clan held this castle and Iwakuni Han, which was assessed at 30,000 (later 60,000) koku. A replica of the castle tower now stands high on a hill above the Nishiki River and the Kintai Bridge. The castle was selected to be one of the 100 Great Castles of Japan by the Japan Castle Foundation in 2006. ==Further reading== * ==References== ==External links== * Iwakuni City Tourism * Iwakuni Kankou.com Category:Castles in Yamaguchi Prefecture Category:100 Fine Castles of Japan Category:Mōri clan",
