He became identified with Spring Green when he built the first Taliesin (studio) nearby in 1911 after leaving his Oak Park, Illinois family, home, and studio with Mamah Borthwick, the wife of an erstwhile client. The disapproval of many area residents only intensified after a disastrous fire and the murder of Borthwick along with her children and a number of workmen by a still-poorly-understood killer in 1914. On the other hand, some Spring Green craftsmen were among Wright's trusted and lifelong favorites. Taliesin was continuously rebuilt over the years and became a local landmark. Wright was buried in the Lloyd-Jones family cemetery next to Unity Chapel near Taliesin and Spring Green from his death in 1959 until 1985, when his remains were controversially removed after the death of his third wife and widow, cremated and reinterred in Arizona. Especially in the past several decades, growing worldwide appreciation of Wright's legacy has brought increased attention as well as tourism to the Spring Green area. Architects from the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, along with Wright-trained architects native to the area, have designed numerous homes and commercial and civic buildings in Spring Green and the surrounding area. ==Attractions== * Taliesin, the summer home and school of architect Frank Lloyd Wright, including the Hillside Home School * American Players Theatre, classical (Shakespeare, etc.) and modern theater, revolving repertory in indoor and outdoor theaters, Juneâ€“October * The House on the Rock tourist museum ==Media== * Voice of the River Valley, A guide to people & events that inspire, inform and enrich life in the Lower Wisconsin and Sugar-Pecatonica River Basins * The Spring Green Home News ==Notable residents== * Svetlana Alliluyeva, daughter of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin * Anne Baxter, Academy Award-winning actress * Evan Alfred Evans, United States federal court judge * Isaac C.
