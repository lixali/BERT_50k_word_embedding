An advantage for Rosslare is that direct sailings allow drivers to take their rest periods during the crossing, rather than when they land in France or Spain. It appears that there is substantial demand from industry (manufacturers and producers) to use direct sailings to avoid the practical difficulties of using the landbridge such as documentation, redtape, inspections, and the need to use several IT systems.

Brexit : Rosslare, le port irlandais qui a renforcé ses liaisons avec l’Europe Ouest-France 2 March 2021 ==Planned development at Europort== The Europort is set to undergo a major transformation over a three to five-year period with new investment of over €30 million invested to provide capacity, facilities and technology to facilitate major growth. There will also be initiatives under the strategic plan for the port including development of the Rosslare Europort Business Park by the Dutch company XELLZ targeting the future Offshore Wind Market and the creation of a Free Zone at Rosslare Europort and the Europort Business Park. It is intended to use technology to create Ireland's smartest digital and automated Port so that the Europort will meet all customs and Brexit requirements for state agencies. It is unclear if this relatively modest investment will be sufficient to take advantage of the huge increase in traffic from 2021 and a possible move to handle container traffic. Verona Murphy, former president of the Irish Road Haulage Association and a local TD, believes the port needs a €200m upgrade to take full advantage of the opportunities Brexit provides, as Rosslare is currently a roll-on roll-off port, taking trucks, drivers and trailers, whereas she maintains what is needed is to update to a load-on load-off container-type port, requiring crane infrastructure and significant land reclamation. The Irish government has said it will invest more in ports like Rosslare as businesses seek certainty amidst the confusion caused by Brexit. ==Planned road infrastructure: N11/N25 scheme== A new motorway costing €350 million is being built linking the N11 at Enniscorthy, along the old N25 road past Wexford town, with the port.Inside the 'Brexit Bypass' as Rosslare Europort prepares to be gateway to Europe and Irish 'invasion of Dunkirk' www.irishmirror.ie, 30 November 2020. The aim is to construct 30 km of road which will link Rosslare Europort/Wexford with Dublin via the M11 motorway and Cork/Waterford via the N25. These routes form part of the European Designated European route E1 and provide a direct link to both mainland Europe and the United Kingdom via Rosslare Europort. The road infrastructure from Oilgate to Rosslare Europort is subject to major delays. In a press release of 8 March 2021, the competent authority stated that it is anticipated that the project could proceed through the statutory planning processes by the end of 2022 at the earliest. Public procurement, possible legal appeals and actual construction will add greatly to this. This could hinder significantly the development of Rosslare Europe, despite the European and national strategic importance of completing this stretch of road. A very serious question mark has arisen over the ability or willingness of the local authority officials to prioritise and construct the new infrastructure at pace. The option selection process first conducted in 2011 is being repeated in 2021. Lead engineer Sean Dobbs told Wexford County Council at a meeting of March 2021 (the minutes of this meeting were not online as of 20 March 2021) that the preferred scheme option for the M11 motorway would now not be confirmed until 18 June 2021. The further delay was attributed to the increase in remote working.\"Remote working blamed for delay in Rosslare - Oylegate motorway\" www.IrishIndependent.ie 20 March 2021 The delays were criticised on a cross-party basis including by the Cathaoirleach (Chairperson), Cllr Ger Carthy. who accused the Council officials of delay tactics. Mr Dobbs said that the countil was trying to predict likely commuter trends due to remote working in 2031, but it is not reported if he stated whether the council had the resources or know-how to carry out such a complex study. However he said that the huge increase in heavy goods vehicles using the current route to Rosslare Euoport was due to increase over the years, but how he arrived at this conclusion has not been reported. Cllr George Lawlor stated that the aim of the N11/N25 project was to assist and foster development of the Europort. Mr Dobbs stated a specialist team was investigating rail infrastructure, due to revived interest in the Waterford to Rosslare railway line, even though this was outside the scope of the N11/N25 project (Cllr Carthy also criticised this new focus). Fianna Fáil Councillor Lisa McDonald raised the issue that the council's delays were unconstitutional and could lead to litigation. The success of Rosslare Europort is already creating some road congestion in South Wexford and a further increase in traffic without adequate timely infrastructure being put in place could provoke tension.IRHA deems call for movement of Dublin Port activities to Rosslare as logical www.fleet.ie However given the delays besetting the N11/N25 project, it is very likely that they will be a major factor in creating congestion to and from the Europort and will be a significant hindrance to the success of the Europort and to delivering a boost to the economy of the southeast of Ireland. ==Facilities== Existing facilities in the terminal building include a cafe with shop, ferry company desks, car rental, and self-service left-luggage lockers. A viewing balcony and foot passenger lounge are to be found on the first floor. Railway services to Wexford, Wicklow and Dublin Connolly are located at Rosslare Europort railway station around a seven-minute walk in the open air along a specially marked path. Bus services to Wexford, and Waterford leave from just outside. Bus and rail connections to Cork, County Kerry, and Limerick, and bus connections to County Clare and Galway are available from Waterford whereas connections to Dublin are available at Wexford. ==Port details== At Rosslare, Iarnród Éireann is an infrastructure provider and operator, providing port facilities and related services, including stevedoring, to shipping lines. Rosslare Europort is operated as a Common User Terminal, meaning that the port authority carries out all stevedoring activities on a common user basis for all shipping lines using the port. The import and export of motor vehicles (trade cars) is one of the most important trades of the port. In excess of 25,000 vehicles are handled per annum. The importer depot is in Rosslare Harbour Village. The port can accommodate cruise liners. Rosslare Europort was included in the 2020 schedule of the Phoenix Reisen-owned liner MS Deutschland. www.cruisemapper.com An all-weather RNLI lifeboat is on station, and the Irish Coast Guard helicopter at Waterford Airport provides air-sea rescue cover.Lifeboat Station : Rosslare Harbour The Airport Company An automatic weather station is maintained adjacent to the port by Met Éireann. The port area is largely on reclaimed land. Reclamation work continued to the late 1990s when the northwest part of the port was constructed using a dragline. Modernisation of facilities has continued to encourage the increase in cars carried on the ferries despite a drop in foot passengers. Rosslare has also handled rolltrailer traffic in the recent past, when Cobelfret operated a service from Rosslare to Zeebrugge/Rotterdam (October 2008 to September 2009). Rolltrailers enable the carriage of lift-on lift-off (LoLo) traffic on roll-on roll-off (RoRo) ships. Rosslare Europort is the second most strategically important seaport in the state after Dublin. It is the second-busiest port in terms of ship visits and gross tonnage, and handles more unitised freight than any other Irish seaport except Dublin – in fact, Rosslare handles more unitised freight than all other seaports in the state, excluding Dublin, put together. Unitised freight is important because all of the high added-value exports on which Ireland's economic recovery depends are exported as unitised freight. Rosslare Europort 2020 yearly figures are as follows: 810,000 passengers, 130,000 freight units and 515,710 tonnes of freight. ==Brexit effect on local economy== In the Rosslare area, businesses have welcomed the boost in traffic going through the port and the town since Brexit. A local entrepreneur was cited by RTE as highlighting beneficial changes such as increased personnel around the area, a big increase in traffic and in people working in Rosslare Harbour, as well as an increase in investment in local business. The BBC has noted that since Brexit, by end February 2021, about 160 new jobs had already been created at Rosslare by government agencies, shipping lines and the port authority itself, and extra business has been generated for local garages and cafes.\"Brexit: Why Irish freight trade is avoiding Britain\" BBC News Reality Check, 4 March 2021 The Netherlands broadcaster NOS stressed the positive economic effects not only on the immediate Rosslare Port area but also in the wider region.Ierse zeehaven Rosslare floreert:'Brexit is goed voor ons' NOS 23 February 2021 ==Ownership of Europort== Rosslare is unique among the commercial ports in Ireland as it operates outside of the Irish Harbours Acts 1996–2009. The port is owned by the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbour Company which owes its origins to the Fishguard Bay Railway and Pier Act 1893, as amended by the Fishguard & Rosslare Railways & Harbours Act, 31 July 1894, both acts of the UK Parliament, still valid in Ireland. The constituent ports (Rosslare and Fishguard) of the company are nowadays the operational and financial responsibility of Iarnród Éireann and Stena Line Ports Ltd respectively. On account of this historic arrangement, Rosslare Europort is operated as a division of Iarnród Éireann. As it is not a separate corporate entity, it cannot be accurately compared in terms of turnover, overheads and employees to the other port companies. This limits the ability to adequately benchmark its performance. It has been reported that the Irish Government intends to re-examine the ownership status of Rosslare Europort to see if it can be freed from British ownership as it is believed that the port's complicated ownership structure is a barrier to essential upgrades in the wake of Brexit, and should be fully owned by the Irish State.Ryan may be the minister to reclaim Rosslare port from Britain The state fears the port's complicated ownership structure will be a barrier to vital upgrades in the wake of Brexit Business Post 24 January 2021\"Rosslare Europort ownership issues to be examined by the Government\" www.southeastradio.ie 24 January 2021 This follows earlier commitments by another Irish Government Minister to raise the issue with the UK GovernmentRoss to talk with UK government about Rosslare Harbour ownership Irish Examiner 21 November 2019\"Shane Ross urged to act on Rosslare ‘quagmire’\" Irish Examiner 14 October 2019 The issue of ownership was first raised in 2019 by James Browne, a dynamic legally qualified local TD, who identified the issue as a major factor in the lack of investment in the Port but Ministers did not follow-up on Browne's timely intervention. Deputy Browne also suggested that Ianróid Eireann should be divested of management of the Europort with a separate independent management entity. He identified the current arrangements as hindering investment and the development of Rosslare to the advantage of Dublin Port. Deputy Browne compared the huge disparity between investment in Dublin Port as compared to Rosslare Europort, partly due to the ownership issue. ==Rosslare Europort and Dublin Port== If the Brexit- induced demand for direct services continues, it appears inevitable that Rosslare Europort will take at least some business from Dublin Port. Dublin Port is congested, lacks adequate space for parking trucks near the Port, which is essential, and has not enough available land to have adequate facilities for inspection checks (health, customs, phytosanitary) and for COVID-19, the latter being carried out in a Dublin Airport car-park, over 12 km from Dublin Port.COVID-19 tests for HGV drivers travelling on the UK Landbridge to France & certain other countries www.gov.ie 5 March 2021. It also has the potential to capitalize on demand from the more lucrative cruise liner business, which offers far greater returns compared to traditional freight and passenger ferries, and would be more economically attractive both for Dublin Port and for Dublin city. By contrast Rosslare Europort has a landbank of 100 acres of adjacent land for development, has virtually unlimited parking and its permanent inspection posts will all be located within the Port area itself. The president of the Irish Road Haulage Association has called for the movement of some of Dublin Port activities to Rosslare. He cited Dublin traffic congestion, time wastage, NOx emissions and Rosslare's geographical position as the closest Irish port to mainland Europe, providing a viable alternative to the UK land bridge. DFDS CEO Torben Carlsen is quoted as stating that the Rosslare–Dunkirk route needs 40–50,000 freight movements per year to be viable. This is equal to around a third of all movements using the UK landbridge to continental Europe on an annual basis.\"Irish Ferries increases driver capacity on Dublin – Cherbourg route\" www.niferry.co.uk 5 January 2021 Eamon Rothwell, CEO of Irish Continental Group which operates Irish Ferries, makes a vigorous case for the continued success of the UK landbridge as it is faster and cheaper than direct sailings. He argues that it has more frequent services, is less prone to cancellations than direct services, and will continue to offer hauliers the flexibility to pick up goods in Britain, all of which mean that businesses will favour it. He pointed out that in the context of annual Irish export-import traffic using shipping, of some 2.77 million 40 ft shipping containers every year, 80 per cent is Irish-British trade, while only 11 per cent uses the landbridge to reach continental Europe. He stated that only 9 per cent use direct routes. He also pointed to the greater efficiency permitted by the landbridge, 3 times more efficient than a direct service in terms of crossings. He emphasised the need to streamline traffic and inspections between the UK and Ireland post- Brexit. Nevertheless, he stressed that his own business had invested €150 million in direct services to the European Continent.\"‘Faster, cheaper’ UK landbridge will lure businesses - Irish Ferries boss Despite extra red tape, landbridge will remain preferable, Eamon Rothwell claims\" Irish Times 2 January 2021 On 22 March 2021, the Dublin Port Company (DPC), a semi-state company, stated that Dublin Port will reach capacity some time between 2030 and 2040 even with the completion of existing or planned development: a fourth terminal, a new jetty, passenger terminal buildings and a heritage zone which will double the existing port's capacity to 77 million tonnes a year. The DPC is seeking planning permission to develop port lands on the Poolbeg Peninsula and build a new bridge to take port-related traffic off the East Wall Road, the Tom Clarke Bridge and Pigeon House Road. However, the DPC admitted those developments will not be enough to meet future demand. Additional capacity at other existing east coast ports – Rosslare, Drogheda and Waterford – would also be required, the company said, so as Dublin Port approached its ultimate capacity, volumes it could not handle could be accommodated elsewhere.\"Relocating Dublin Port would cost over €8bn, says company DPC publishes papers setting out various options for delivering additional capacity\" www.Irish Times.com 23 March 2021 Eugene Drennan, head of the Irish Road Haulage Association, stated that Dublin Port was already at maximum capacity and suggested that congestion at Dublin could be relieved by Rosslare, Waterford and Cork ports. DPC states that the Dublin port should be open 24/7 and reduce the time trailers and containers spend at port terminals. However Mr Drennan pointed out that requests for longer opening hours had been met with blank refusal by DPC. The time spent by trailers and containers in the port could be greatly reduced by having all inspections for a shipment carried out in the same location (bringing the inspectors to the freight rather than vice versa, as is currently the case). The DPC is inviting public consultations by end June 2021.\"Dublin Port will hit capacity within 20 years DPC calls for planning on development of east coast infrastructure\"| www.independent.ie 23 March 2021 Given the relative volumes of business, and the importance of Dublin, Rosslare's ambitions can never hope to match Dublin Port but Rosslare could aim to relieve Dublin Port as regards direct routes and in the face of rising congestion in Dublin. These would be ambitious aims given the slow decline of Rosslare prior to Brexit. ==SailRail== The Rosslare Europort ferry connection using Stena Line to Fishguard Harbour and then by train operated by Transport for Wales to Carmarthen, Swansea and Cardiff links into Great Western Railway services to Bristol Parkway, Reading and London Paddington. This is popular with Rugby fans going to the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff or the Aviva Stadium in Dublin. Train and ferry connections across the Irish Sea are promoted as an alternative to air. ==Irish Rail and ferry connections== Trains connect the port on the Rosslare Line via , , Gorey, , , to Dublin Connolly. Connecting routes from Dublin Connolly include the Sligo Line and the Belfast Line. ==See also== *West Wales Lines ==References== ===Notes=== ===Bibliography=== * * * ==External links== * Official site Category:Ports and harbours of the Republic of Ireland Category:Transport in County Wexford Category:Geography of County Wexford",
