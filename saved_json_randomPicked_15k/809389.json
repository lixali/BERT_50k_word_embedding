Based on the American cable network of the same name, the channel features lifestyle programming, with a mix of reality, culinary, home renovation and makeover series. The channel was launched on September 7, 2001 as Discovery Health Channel by Alliance Atlantis and Discovery Communications, which focused on health and wellness-oriented programming. Discovery Health was acquired by Canwest in 2008 which rebranded the network as Twist TV in 2010 before being taken over by Shaw Media. As Twist TV, the channel shifted to reality programming aimed at a female demographic. After being rebranded to FYI in 2014 and acquired by Corus in 2016, the channel ended its operations on December 31, 2019. ==History== ===As Discovery Health=== 150px|thumb|left|Logo as Discovery Health used from 2001 to 2007 In January 2000, Alliance Atlantis brokered a deal with Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and several Canadian television providers, including both national satellite companies Bell ExpressVu and Star Choice, to distribute News Corporation's cable channel, The Health Network, in Canada.Diagnosis Good For Canada / Health Net Lands On Sat Services Prior To...; AllBusiness.com; 2000-01-11 The deal would mark the first time The Health Network would be available in Canada.

On November 24, 2000, Alliance Atlantis (which would hold 80% majority interest in the channel) and News Corporation (which would hold the remaining 20% interest) were granted a broadcasting licence for The Health Network Canada by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).Decision CRTC 2000-461; CRTC; 2000-12-14 Prior to the launch of the network, in September 2001, Discovery Communications (owners of Discovery Health Channel in the U.S.) bought The Health Network from News Corporation for US$255 million.Discovery Finds That FitTV Was Best Fit After All; MultiChannel.com; 2003-11-13 Through that transaction, Discovery Communications would also acquire News Corporation's 20% interest in The Health Network Canada. 140px|thumb|left|Logo as Discovery Health used from 2007 to 2010 As a result of Discovery Communications' newly acquired interest in the service, the network was launched that same month on September 7, 2001 as the Discovery Health Channel.

First, Discovery Communications announced that the flagship Discovery Health channel in the U.S. would be replaced by the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN) in January 2011. OWN later reached an agreement with Corus Entertainment to launch a Canadian version of that channel shortly after the U.S. version's debut. Later in April 2010, Discovery Communications announced an expanded long-term agreement with Bell Media (then CTVglobemedia, Discovery's Canadian partner for most of its other channels) under which Bell holds Canadian broadcast rights to most of the Discovery Communications programming library, including Discovery Health programs, and the right to launch new Discovery-branded channels.CTV and Discovery Communications Inc.

The launch of FYI (as well as CI) was intended to draw in more female viewers, the primary audience of Shaw Media's lifestyle networks. In addition to programming from the U.S. service, as well as other Shaw Media-owned channels, the new channel will air shows from other sources. The channel was relaunched on the morning of September 1, 2014 with a free preview to last the rest of the month. A month prior, a Canadian version of the FYI website went online. Over time, the website was updated to include information pertaining to the channel. A YouTube channel went online August 28, 2014; on that day, sneak peeks of FYI programming aired on Lifetime and Slice. On April 1, 2016, Shaw Media was sold to Corus Entertainment. At the Corus Entertainment upfronts, Corus Entertainment announced its Fall 2019 schedules of W Network and Showcase; FYI, was not included in the upfronts. The following day, Telus announced that it would be adding Much, a Bell Media channel that launched in 1984, by replacing FYI on December 31, 2019. Additionally, this would mean Much would launch the same way it did in the United States as Fuse replaced MuchMusic USA on May 19, 2003. In October 2019, Corus announced that FYI would be shut down on December 31, 2019. The channel space created in 2001 by Discovery Health Channel ceased to exist the day the channel went off the air. ==Fyi HD== In late 2016, Corus launched FYI HD, a 1080i high definition simulcast of the standard definition feed.
