 "text": "is a Japanese pop duo from Yomitan, Okinawa that debuted in 1996. ==History== Kiroro debuted in 1996 as an independent band, and later made their major debut in 1998 with the song \"\". They performed on Kōhaku Uta Gassen in 1998, 1999 and 2001. == Etymology == When vocalist Chiharu Tamashiro was in her primary school days, she visited Ikedamachi, Hokkaido, for a regional exchange program. The Ainu language made a deep impression on her. With the Ainu words 'Kiroru' and 'Kiroro-an', Tamashiro and Kinjo decided on the name \"Kiroro\" for the group; \"Kiroru\" meaning a wide walking path and \"Kiroro-an\" meaning \"resilient\" and \"healthy.\" The name \"Kiroro,\" however, was already registered in 1981 to the Yamaha Organization in Hamamatsu City, Shizuoka, for the Kiroro Resort in Akaigawa Village, Hokkaido. Victor Entertainment made agreements with the Yamaha organization for use of the name. ==Members== * (born in Okinawa, Japan) - chorus and vocals * (born in Okinawa, Japan) - keyboard ==Discography== ===Albums=== # - October 1, 1998 ## Nagai Aida ## ## Mirai e ## ## ## ## ## ## ## # - September 22, 1999 (Ayano Kinjo's solo album) # - December 8, 1999 # - September 26, 2000 (Concept Album) # TREE OF LIFE - January 13, 2001 (Taiwan), January 24, 2001 (Japan) (It is the first time (and only time, up to the album Wonderful Days) that the date of release in Taiwan is earlier than Japan.) # - February 21, 2002 (Best Album) # Four Leaves Clover - December 18, 2002 # Diary - March 3, 2004 # - January 21, 2005 (Okinawa limited edition), June 23, 2005 (National edition) (Mini album) (Dedicated to their homeland, Okinawa.
