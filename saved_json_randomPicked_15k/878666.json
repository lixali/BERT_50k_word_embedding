Wade attributes the uncommon spelling of his and his father's first name to his grandmother. JoLinda already had two children when she married Wade's father, and with him she had Dwyane and his older sister Tragil. The pair separated when Wade was four months old. Wade described his early childhood in the South Side of Chicago as trying. When his parents divorced, JoLinda was given custody of the two children. JoLinda struggled with drug addiction, and she was in and out of prison. At eight years old, Tragil tricked her brother into thinking they were going to the movies, only to take him to live with his father and stepmother. Wade visited his mother on occasion until his father moved the family to Robbins, Illinois, after which Wade would not see her for two years. Wade turned to basketball and football, avoiding the temptations of drugs and gangs. Wade credited Tragil as the person most responsible for pointing him in the right direction.

In the 2014–15 season, Wade missed seven consecutive games due to a hamstring injury. On December 17, 2014, he scored a season-high 42 points, his highest total in almost four years, but Miami lost 105–87 to Utah. He was again named an All-Star but pulled out due to another hamstring injury. The Heat finished the season with a 37–45 record, as Wade missed the postseason for just the second time. On June 29, 2015, Wade opted out of his contract, but then signed a one-year, $20 million contract. Wade hit just seven 3-point shots during the 2015–16 regular season. However, in the 2016 postseason, Wade converted on his first seven three-point shot attempts. Wade had never made more than five three-pointers in a row. ===Chicago Bulls (2016–2017)=== thumb|left|Wade with the Cavs in 2017 In July 2016, Wade joined his hometown team, the Chicago Bulls, on a two-year deal worth approximately $47 million. Initially, the Heat offered a two-year, $20 million contract, before increasing it to a two-year, $40 million offer, both of which Wade felt were unacceptable. The relationship ended badly with Wade and the Heat squabbling. Wade teamed with Jimmy Butler and Rajon Rondo in Chicago. In January 2017, the trio were all fined for criticizing their young teammates' effort. In March 2017, Wade sustained a fractured elbow, returning for the playoffs, but the Bulls were defeated 4–2 by the Boston Celtics in the first round. === Cleveland Cavaliers (2017–2018) === On September 24, 2017, three months after trading Butler and waiving Rondo, the Bulls reached an agreement on a buyout with Wade. Three days later, Wade signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers, reuniting him with Miami Heat teammate LeBron James. During the season, Wade objected to coach Tyronn Lue's plan to play him off the bench. Wade started for the Cavaliers in the first three games, but shot only 7-for-25. After a blowout loss to the Orlando Magic in the third game, Wade volunteered to take a bench role, becoming leader of the second unit. ===Return to Miami (2018–2019)=== On February 8, 2018, at the NBA trade deadline, the Cavaliers overhauled their roster. Acquiring guards Jordan Clarkson, George Hill, Rodney Hood and Cedi Osman, the Cavaliers traded Wade back to the Miami Heat in exchange for a protected 2024 second-round draft pick. At the funeral of Wade's long-time agent Henry Thomas in January, Wade mended relations with Riley. On February 9, in his first game, Wade was garnered a standing ovation and came off the bench in a 91–85 win over the Milwaukee Bucks. On February 27, Wade scored a season-high 27 points as the Heat rallied to beat the Philadelphia 76ers 102–101. On April 3, in a 101–98 win over the Atlanta Hawks, Wade reached 5,000 assists in a Heat uniform, becoming the ninth player to score 20,000 points and collect 5,000 assists with one team, joining Karl Malone, Bryant, Jordan, James, Larry Bird, John Havlicek, Oscar Robertson and Jerry West. On April 16, Wade scored 28 points to end the 76ers' 17-game winning streak and lead the Heat to a 113–103 Game 2 win over Philadelphia and even the first-round playoff series. He passed Larry Bird for 10th on the NBA's career postseason scoring list. In the off-season, Wade announced his intentions to retire after the 2018–19 season, re-signing with the Heat on September 18. He missed seven games in mid-November due to the birth of his daughter. On November 25, Wade scored a season-high 35 points, the most ever by a Miami bench player. On December 9, he scored 25 points in his 1,000th career game. On January 6, 2019, Wade became the third player in NBA history to record at least 20,000 points, 5,000 assists, 4,000 rebounds, 1,500 steals, 800 blocks and 500 three-pointers. Wade was named by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver as a special roster addition for the 2019 All-Star game, thus marking his 13th All-Star appearance. Wade had received the second-most fan votes for guards in the Eastern Conference. On April 9, Wade played his last home game in Miami, scoring 30 points. In his final game the following night, Wade recorded his fifth career triple-double with 25 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists. On January 7, 2020, the Heat announced that Wade's No. 3 jersey would be retired on February 22. == NBA executive career == During his playing career with Miami, Wade had discussed the potential for a future ownership stake in the Heat franchise but Wade was unable to commit at the time, according to Heat owner Micky Arison. On April 16, 2021, it was announced that Wade had purchased an undisclosed minority ownership stake in the Utah Jazz franchise of the NBA, joining an ownership group led by his personal friend and associate, Ryan Smith, the Jazz majority owner and team governor. Wade is a member of a small ownership group that includes Smiths, his wife Ashley, investor and Accel partner Ryan Sweeney, Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon- Brookes and the Miller family, which previously owned the team. Wade said in the announcement of his purchase that he hoped to take a hands-on approach to his involvement, and highlighted his close brother-like relationship with Jazz star Donovan Mitchell, who he called the player most like him and \"2.0\". ==National team career== Wade was a member of the 2004 U.S. national team.
