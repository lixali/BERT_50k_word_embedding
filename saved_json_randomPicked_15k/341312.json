Originally comprising a territory of 2.5 km2 in Xiamen City, it was expanded to 131 km2 in 1984, covering the entire Xiamen Island, which comprises Huli District and Siming District excluding Gulangyu. Haicang and Xinglin districts were designated \"Taiwan Businessmen Investment Zones\" on 20 May 1989, and Jimei District was designated in 1992. Foreign investment enjoys the same economic policies as in the special economic zone. == See also== *Shantou Special Economic Zone *Shenzhen Special Economic Zone *Zhuhai Special Economic Zone == External links == *Chinavista *CNR *Xinhuanet Category:Xiamen Category:Special Economic Zones of China Category:1980 establishments in China",
