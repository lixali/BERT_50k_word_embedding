 "text": "Vipassanā (Pāli) or විපස්සනා (Sinhala) literally \"special, super (Vi), seeing (Passanā)\", is a Buddhist term that is often translated as \"insight\". The Pali Canon describes it as one of two qualities of mind which is developed in bhāvanā, the training of the mind, the other being samatha (mind calming). It is often defined as a practice that seeks \"insight into the true nature of reality\", defined as anicca \"impermanence\", dukkha \"suffering, unsatisfactoriness\", anattā \"non-self\", the three marks of existence in the Theravada tradition, and as śūnyatā \"emptiness\" and Buddha-nature in the Mahayana traditions. Vipassanā practice in the Theravada tradition largely fell out of practice by the 10th century, but was reintroduced in Toungoo and Konbaung Burma in the 18th century, based on contemporary readings of the Satipaṭṭhāna sutta, the Visuddhimagga, and other texts. A new tradition developed in the 19th and 20th centuries, centering on 'dry insight' and downplaying samatha. It became of central importance in the 20th century Vipassanā movement as developed by Ledi Sayadaw and U Vimala and popularised by Mahasi Sayadaw, V. R. Dhiravamsa, and S. N. Goenka. In modern Theravada, the combination or disjunction of vipassanā and samatha is a matter of dispute. While the Pali sutras hardly mention vipassanā, describing it as a mental quality alongside samatha which develops in tandem and leads to liberation, the Abhidhamma Pitaka and the commentaries describe samatha and vipassanā as two separate techniques, taking samatha to mean concentration- meditation. The Vipassanā movement favors vipassanā over samatha, but some critics point out that both are necessary elements of the Buddhist training, while other critics argue that dhyana is not a single-pointed concentration exercise. ==Etymology== Vipassanā is a Pali word derived from the older prefix \"vi-\" meaning \"special\", and the verbal root \"-passanā\" meaning \"seeing\". It is often translated as \"insight\" or \"clear-seeing\". The \"vi\" in vipassanā has many possible meanings, it could mean to '[see] into', '[see] through' or to '[see] in a special way.' A synonym for vipassanā is paccakkha \"perceptible to the senses\" (Pāli; Sanskrit: ), literally \"before the eyes,\" which refers to direct experiential perception. Thus, the type of seeing denoted by vipassanā is that of direct perception, as opposed to knowledge derived from reasoning or argument. In Tibetan, vipaśyanā is lhaktong (). Lhak means \"higher\", \"superior\", \"greater\"; tong is \"view, to see\". So together, lhaktong may be rendered into English as \"superior seeing\", \"great vision\" or \"supreme wisdom.\" This may be interpreted as a \"superior manner of seeing\", and also as \"seeing that which is the essential nature.\" Its nature is a lucidity--a clarity of mind. Henepola Gunaratana defined vipassanā as \"Looking into something with clarity and precision, seeing each component as distinct and separate, and piercing all the way through so as to perceive the most fundamental reality of that thing.\" ==Origins== According to Thanissaro Bhikkhu, in the sutta pitaka the term \"vipassanā\" is hardly mentioned, while they frequently mention jhana as the meditative practice to be undertaken. When vipassanā is mentioned, it is always in tandem with samatha, as a pair of qualities of mind which are developed. According to Thanissaro Bhikkhu, \"samatha, jhana, and vipassana were all part of a single path.\" Norman notes that \"the Buddha's way to release [...] was by means of meditative practices.\" According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, dhyāna constituted the original \"liberating practice\". Vetter further argues that the eightfold path constitutes a body of practices which prepare one, and lead up to, the practice of dhyana. Vetter and Bronkhorst further note that dhyana is not limited to single-pointed concentration, which seems to be described in the first jhana, but develops into equanimity and mindfulness, \"born from samadhi\" but no longer absorbed in concentration, being mindfully aware of objects while being indifferent to it, \"directing states of meditative absorption towards the mindful awareness of objects.\" Though both terms appear in the Sutta Pitaka, Gombrich and Brooks argue that the distinction as two separate paths originates in the earliest interpretations of the Sutta Pitaka, not in the suttas themselves. Henepola Gunaratana notes that \"[t]he classical source for the distinction between the two vehicles of serenity and insight is the Visuddhimagga.\" According to Richard Gombrich, a development took place in early Buddhism resulting in a change in doctrine, which considered prajna to be an alternative means to awakening, alongside the practice of dhyana. The suttas contain traces of ancient debates between Mahayana and Theravada schools in the interpretation of the teachings and the development of insight. Out of these debates developed the idea that bare insight suffices to reach liberation, by discerning the Three marks (qualities) of (human) existence (tilakkhana), namely dukkha (suffering), anatta (non-self) and anicca (impermanence). According to Buddhist and Asian studies scholar Robert Buswell Jr., by the 10th century vipassana was no longer practiced in the Theravada tradition, due to the belief that Buddhism had degenerated, and that liberation was no longer attainable until the coming of the future Buddha, Maitreya. It was re-introduced in Myanmar (Burma) in the 18th century by Medawi (1728–1816), leading to the rise of the Vipassana movement in the 20th century, re-inventing vipassana meditation and developing simplified meditation techniques, based on the Satipatthana sutta, the Visuddhimagga, and other texts, emphasizing satipatthana and bare insight. Ultimately, these techniques aim at stream entry, with the idea that this first stage of the path to awakening safeguards future development of the person towards full awakening, despite the degenerated age we live in. ==Theravāda== ===Relation with samatha=== While the Abhidhamma and the commentaries present samatha and vipassana as separate paths, in the sutras vipassana and samatha, combined with sati (mindfulness), are used together to explore \"the fundamental nature of mind and body. In the later Theravada tradition, samatha is regarded as a preparation for vipassanā, pacifying the mind and strengthening concentration in order for insight to arise, which leads to liberation. The Buddha is said to have identified two paramount mental qualities that arise from wholesome bhavana (training or development of the mind): * Samatha, calm abiding, which steadies, composes, unifies and concentrates the mind; * Vipassanā, insight, which enables one to see, explore and discern \"formations\" (conditioned phenomena based on the five aggregates).These definitions of samatha and vipassana are based on the Four Kinds of Persons Sutta (AN 4.94). This article's text is primarily based on Bodhi (2005), pp. 269-70, 440 n. 13. See also Thanissaro (1998d) The Buddha is said to have extolled serenity and insight as conduits for attaining the unconditioned state of nibbana (Pāli; Skt.: Nirvana). For example, in the Kimsuka Tree Sutta (SN 35.245), the Buddha provides an elaborate metaphor in which serenity and insight are \"the swift pair of messengers\" who deliver the message of nibbana via the noble eightfold path.Bodhi (2000), pp. 1251-53. See also Thanissaro (1998c) (where this sutta is identified as SN 35.204). See also, for instance, a discourse (Pāli: sutta) entitled \"Serenity and Insight\" (SN 43.2), where the Buddha states: \"And what, bhikkhus, is the path leading to the unconditioned? Serenity and insight....\" (Bodhi, 2000, pp. 1372-73). In the Four Ways to Arahantship Sutta (AN 4.170), Ven. Ānanda reports that people attain arahantship using calm abiding and insight in one of three ways: # They develop calm abiding and then insight (Pāli: samatha- pubbangamam vipassanam) # They develop insight and then calm abiding (Pāli: vipassana-pubbangamam samatham) # They develop calm abiding and insight in tandem (Pāli: samatha-vipassanam yuganaddham), for instance, obtaining the first jhāna and then seeing in the associated aggregates the three marks of existence before proceeding to the second jhāna.Bodhi (2005), pp. 268, 439 nn. 7, 9, 10. See also Thanissaro (1998f) In the Pāli canon, the Buddha never mentions independent samatha and vipassana meditation practices; instead, samatha and vipassana are two \"qualities of mind\" to be developed through meditation. As Thanissaro Bhikkhu writes, Buddhist and Asian studies scholar Robert Buswell Jr. states that the method most often described in the Pāli canon is one where samatha and vipassana are practiced together. Jhana is induced by samatha, and then jhana is reflected upon with mindfulness, becoming the object of vipassana, realizing that jhana is marked by the three characteristics. Buddhist texts describe that all Buddhas and their chief disciples used this method. Texts also describe a method of \"bare insight\", or \"dry insight\" where only vipassana is practiced, examining ordinary physical and mental phenomena to discern the three marks. In the Nikaya-texts this method is less common, but has become the foundation of the Vipassana movement. According to Thai meditation master Ajahn Lee, the practice of both samatha and vipassana together allows one to achieve various mental powers and knowledges (Pali: abhiññā), including the attainment of Nirvana, whereas the practice of vipassana alone allows for the achievement of Nirvana, but no other mental powers or knowledges. ===Vipassanā movement=== The term vipassana is often conflated with the Vipassana movement, a movement which popularised the new vipassana teachings and practice. It started in the 1950s in Burma, but has gained wide renown mainly through American Buddhist teachers such as Joseph Goldstein, Tara Brach, Gil Fronsdal, Sharon Salzberg, and Jack Kornfield. The movement has had a wide appeal due to being open and inclusive to different Buddhist and non-buddhist wisdom, poetry as well as science. It has together with the modern American Zen tradition served as one of the main inspirations for the 'mindfulness movement' as developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn and others. The Vipassanā Movement, also known as the Insight Meditation Movement, is rooted in Theravāda Buddhism and the revival of meditation techniques, especially the \"New Burmese Method\" and the Thai Forest Tradition, as well as the modern influences on the traditions of Sri Lanka, Burma, Laos and Thailand. In the Vipassanā Movement, the emphasis is on the Satipatthana Sutta and the use of mindfulness to gain insight into the impermanence of the self. It argues that the development of strong samatha can be disadvantageous, a stance for which the Vipassana Movement has been criticised, especially in Sri Lanka. The \"New Burmese Method\" was developed by U Nārada (1868–1955), and popularised by Mahasi Sayadaw (1904–1982) and Nyanaponika Thera (1901–1994). Other influential Burmese proponents are Ledi Sayadaw and Mogok Sayadaw (who was less known to the West due to lack of International Mogok Centres); Mother Sayamagyi and S. N. Goenka which were both students of Sayagyi U Ba Khin. Influential Thai teachers are Ajahn Chah and Buddhadasa. A well-known Asian female teacher is Dipa Ma. ===Vipassana meditation=== ====Morality, mindfulness of breathing, and reflection==== Vipassanā meditation uses sati (mindfulness) and samatha (calm), developed through practices such as anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing), combined with the contemplation of impermanence as observed in the bodily and mental changes, to gain insight into the true nature of this reality. Practice begins with the preparatory stage, the practice of sila, morality, giving up worldly thoughts and desires.Mahāsi Sayādaw, Manual of Insight, Chapter 5 Jeff Wilson notes that morality is a quintessential element of Buddhist practice, and is also emphasized by the first generation of post-war western teachers. Yet, in the contemporary mindfulness movement, morality as an element of practice has been mostly discarded, 'mystifying' the origins of mindfulness. The practitioner then engages in anapanasati, mindfulness of breathing, which is described in the Satipatthana Sutta as going into the forest and sitting beneath a tree and then to simply watch the breath. If the breath is long, to notice that the breath is long, if the breath is short, to notice that the breath is short.Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta No. 118, Section No. 2, translated from the PaliSatipatthana Sutta In the \"New Burmese Method,\" the practitioner pays attention to any arising mental or physical phenomenon, engaging in vitarka, noting or naming physical and mental phenomena (\"breathing, breathing\"), without engaging the phenomenon with further conceptual thinking.Mahasi Sayadaw, Practical Vipassana InstructionsBhante Bodhidhamma, Vipassana as taught by The Mahasi Sayadaw of Burma By noticing the arising of physical and mental phenomena, the meditator becomes aware how sense impressions arise from the contact between the senses and physical and mental phenomena, as described in the five skandhas and paṭiccasamuppāda. According to Sayadaw U Pandita, awareness and observation of these sensations is de-coupled from any kind of physical response, which is intended to recondition one's impulsive responses to stimuli, becoming less likely to physically or emotionally overreact to the happenings of the world.Sayadaw U Pandita, How to Practice Vipassana Insight Meditation , Lion's Roar The practitioner also becomes aware of the perpetual changes involved in breathing, and the arising and passing away of mindfulness. This noticing is accompanied by reflections on causation and other Buddhist teachings, leading to insight into dukkha, anatta, and anicca.Mahasi Sayadaw, Practical Vipassana Instructions, p.22-27 When the three characteristics have been comprehended, reflection subdues, and the process of noticing accelerates, noting phenomena in general, without necessarily naming them. ====Stages of Jhana in the Vipassana movement==== Vipassanā jhanas are stages that describe the development of samatha in vipassanā meditation practice as described in modern Burmese Vipassana meditation.Ingram, Daniel (2008), Mastering the core teachings of the Buddha, Karnac Books, p.246 Mahasi Sayadaw's student Sayadaw U Pandita described the four vipassanā jhanas as follows:Sayadaw U Pandita, In this very life # The meditator first explores the body/mind connection as one, nonduality; discovering three characteristics. The first jhana consists in seeing these points and in the presence of vitarka and vicara. Phenomena reveal themselves as appearing and ceasing. # In the second jhana, the practice seems effortless. Vitarka and vicara both disappear. # In the third jhana, piti, the joy, disappears too: there is only happiness (sukha) and concentration. # The fourth jhana arises, characterised by purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. The practice leads to direct knowledge. The comfort disappears because the dissolution of all phenomena is clearly visible. The practice will show every phenomenon as unstable, transient, disenchanting. The desire of freedom will take place. ==Northern tradition and Mahāyāna== ===Texts=== The north Indian Buddhist traditions like the Sarvastivada and the Sautrāntika practiced vipaśyanā meditation as outlined in texts like the Abhidharmakośakārikā of Vasubandhu and the Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra. The Abhidharmakośakārikā states that vipaśyanā is practiced once one has reached samadhi \"absorption\" by cultivating the four foundations of mindfulness (smṛtyupasthānas).De La Vallee Poussin (trans.); Pruden, Leo M. (trans.) Abhidharmakosabhasyam of Vasubandhu Vol. III page 925 This is achieved, according to Vasubandhu, Asanga's Abhidharma-samuccaya states that the practice of śamatha-vipaśyanā is a part of a Bodhisattva's path at the beginning, in the first \"path of preparation\" (sambhāramarga).Rahula; Boin-Webb. Abhidharmasamuccaya The Compendium of the Higher Teaching by Asanga, 1971 page xxiii The later Indian Mahayana scholastic tradition, as exemplified by Shantideva's Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra, saw śamatha as a necessary prerequisite to vipaśyanā and thus one needed to first begin with calm abiding meditation and then proceed to insight. In the Pañjikā commentary of Prajñākaramati () on the Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra, vipaśyanā is defined simply as \"wisdom (prajñā) that has the nature of thorough knowledge of reality as it is. ===Sunyata=== Mahāyāna vipaśyanā differs from the Theravada tradition in its strong emphasis on the meditation on emptiness (shunyata) of all phenomena. The Mahayana Akṣayamati-nirdeśa refers to vipaśyanā as seeing phenomena as they really are, that is, empty, without self, nonarisen, and without grasping. The Prajnaparamita sutra in 8,000 lines states that the practice of insight is the non-appropriation of any dharmas, including the five aggregates: Likewise the Prajnaparamita in 25,000 lines states that a Bodhisattva should know the nature of the five aggregates as well as all dharmas thus: ===Sudden insight=== The Sthavira nikāya, one of the early Buddhist schools from which the Theravada-tradition originates, emphasized sudden insight: \"In the Sthaviravada [...] progress in understanding comes all at once, 'insight' (abhisamaya) does not come 'gradually' (successively - anapurva).\" The Mahāsāṃghika, another one of the early Buddhist schools, had the doctrine of ekakṣaṇacitta, \"according to which a Buddha knows everything in a single thought-instant\". This process however, meant to apply only to the Buddha and Peccaka buddhas. Lay people may have to experience various levels of insights to become fully enlightened. The Mahayana tradition emphasizes prajñā, insight into śūnyatā, dharmatā, the two truths doctrine, clarity and emptiness, or bliss and emptiness: Although Theravada and Mahayana are commonly understood as different streams of Buddhism, their practice however, may reflect emphasis on insight as a common denominator: \"In practice and understanding Zen is actually very close to the Theravada Forest Tradition even though its language and teachings are heavily influenced by Taoism and Confucianism.\" The emphasis on insight is discernible in the emphasis in Chan Buddhism on sudden insight (subitism), though in the Chan tradition, this insight is to be followed by gradual cultivation. ===East Asian Mahāyāna=== In Chinese Buddhism, the works of Tiantai master Zhiyi (such as the Mohe Zhiguan, \"Great śamatha-vipaśyanā\") are some of the most influential texts which discuss vipaśyanā meditation from a Mahayana perspective. In this text, Zhiyi teaches the contemplation of the skandhas, ayatanas, dhātus, the Kleshas, false views and several other elements.Fa Qing,The Śamatha and Vipaśyanā in Tian Tai, Poh Ming Tse Symposium 2013: One Master Three Meditative Traditions. Singapore, August 30, 2013; pp.30-47 Likewise the influential text called the Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana has a section on calm and insight meditation.Harvey, Peter. An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices, page 257. It states: The Zen tradition advocates the simultaneous practice of śamatha and vipaśyanā, and this is called the practice of silent illumination.Guo Gu, Silent Illumination Guo Gu , Insight Journal 2014. The classic Chan text known as the Platform Sutra states: ===Tibetan Buddhism=== Samatha and vipassana are explicitly referred to in Tibetan Buddhism. According to Thrangu Rinpoche, when shamatha and vipashyana are combined, as in the mainstream tradition Madhyamaka approach of ancestors like Shantideva and Kamalashila, through samatha disturbing emotions are abandoned, which thus facilitates vipashyana, \"clear seeing.\" Vipashyana is cultivated through reasoning, logic and analysis in conjunction with Shamatha. In contrast, in the siddha tradition of the direct approach of Mahamudra and Dzogchen, vipashyana is ascertained directly through looking into one's own mind. After this initial recognition of vipashyana, the steadiness of shamatha is developed within that recognition. According to Thrangu Rinpoche, it is however also common in the direct approach to first develop enough shamatha to serve as a basis for vipashyana.Thrangu Rinpoche, Essentials of Mahamudra In Tibetan Buddhism, the classical practice of śamatha and vipaśyanā is strongly influenced by the Mahāyāna text called the Bhavanakrama of Indian master Kamalaśīla. Kamalaśīla defines vipaśyanā as \"the discernment of reality\" (bhūta-pratyavekṣā) and \"accurately realizing the true nature of dharmas\".Adam, Martin T. Two Concepts of Meditation and Three Kinds of Wisdom in Kamalaśīla’s Bhāvanākramas: A Problem of Translation. University of Victoria, page 78-79 Indian Mahāyāna Buddhism employed both deductive investigation (applying ideas to experience) and inductive investigation (drawing conclusions from direct experience) in the practice of vipaśyanā. According to Leah Zahler, only the tradition of deductive analysis in vipaśyanā was transmitted to Tibet in the sūtrayāna context. In Tibet direct examination of moment-to-moment experience as a means of generating insight became exclusively associated with vajrayāna. Mahāmudrā and Dzogchen use vipaśyanā extensively. This includes some methods of the other traditions, but also their own specific approaches. They place a greater emphasis on meditation on symbolic images. Additionally in the Vajrayāna (tantric) path, the true nature of mind is pointed out by the guru, and this serves as a direct form of insight. ==See also== * Samatha * Atthakavagga and Parayanavagga * International Meditation Centre * Global Vipassana Pagoda * Jñāna * Meditation * Neural mechanisms of mindfulness meditation * Secular Buddhism * Upasana * Vipassana Meditation Centre * Vipassī Buddha * Zazen ==Notes== ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==External links== ===History=== * Theravāda Spirituality in the West ===Background=== * Insight Meditation Online From Buddhanet.net * Mahasi Sayadaw, Satipatthana Vipassana: Criticisms and Replies * Jeffrey S, Brooks, The Fruits (Phala) of the Contemplative Life * Publications in the Theravāda tradition/ Pariyatti.org * Publications and resources on Vipassana meditation (as taught by S.N.
