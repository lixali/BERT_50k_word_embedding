 "text": "Gamelan degung is a form of Sundanese musical ensemble that uses a subset of modified gamelan instruments with a particular mode of pelog scale. The instruments are manufactured under local conditions in towns in West Java such as Bogor.Retno K. Djojo, \"For the love of music\", The Jakarta Post, 29 January 2010. Degung music is often played at public gatherings in West Java, such as at local elections, as well as many other events.Theresia Sufa, \"Sundanese music and dance liven election day in Bogor\", The Jakarta Post, 26 October 2008. There is international interest in degung as well among communities in other countries interested in Indonesia and gamelan music.Dewi Anggraeni, \"Melbourne: Gamelan, elephants and 'Jackpot'\", , The Jakarta Post, 22 February 2004. == Instruments == The instrumentation of gamelan degung is quite flexible. It may include: * Bonang/kol√®nang: two rows of seven small bulbous gongs. It differs from its Javanese counterpart in that the rows are each placed on either side of the player. * Saron/peking: a high-pitched bronze metallophone with fourteen keys. * Panerus: another bronze metallophone, similar to the peking but pitched an octave lower. * Jengglong: six bulbous gongs suspended from the same frame. * Goong ageung: a large gong. * A set of kendang, consisting of one large and two small double-sided drums. * Suling degung: a four-holed bamboo flute. * Gambang: a wooden xylophone. In classical degung, the bonang serves as a conductor for the whole ensemble. Except in certain modern compositions, it is rarely absent. ==Gallery== File:Closeup of a gong from gamelan degung.jpg|Closeup of a bonang from gamelan degung Image:Gamelandegung.jpg|Sundanese gamelan degung Image:Diajar gamelan degung.jpg|Sundanese students playing gamelan degung on the street File: Gamelan indra swara.jpg|Gamelan degung performed by Indra Swara in Mexico File:Gamelan indra swara mexico.jpg|Gamelan degung instruments File:Gamelan degung barudak grupo Indra Swara Mexico.jpg|Bonang ==See also== * Gong gede == References == Category:Gamelan ensembles and genres Category:Sundanese music",
