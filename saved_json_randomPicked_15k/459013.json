 "text": "The flag of Dominica was adopted on 3 November 1978, with some small changes having been made in 1981, 1988, and 1990. The original flag was designed by playwright Alwin Bully in early 1978 as the country prepared for independence. It is one of only two national flags (the other being Nicaragua's) that currently use purple. ==History and design== The flag, adopted in 1978, features the national bird emblem, the sisserou parrot (Amazona imperialis), which also appears on the coat of arms granted on 21 July 1961. This parrot, endemic to Dominica, is an endangered species with a population of only 250â€“350 individuals.\"Amazona imperialis\", The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Retrieved 12 September 2014. The green field represents the lush vegetation of the island. The cross represents the Trinity and Christianity, with its three colours symbolising the natives, the fertile soil, and the pure water. The 10 green five-pointed stars stand for the country's 10 parishes: (St Andrew, St David, St George, St John, St Joseph, St Luke, St Mark, St Patrick, St Paul, and St Peter), while the red disc stands for justice. The sisserou parrot is sometimes coloured either blue or purple (the parrot's actual colour). The use of purple makes the flag of Dominica one of only two flags of sovereign states (alongside the flag of Nicaragua) to contain the colour. The flag of Dominica, along with other national symbols, was the focus of a government-sponsored \"Emblems Week\" in 2016. An initiative of the independence committee, Emblems Week is aimed at reflecting on the meaning of the national emblems, and promoting their use among members of the general public and particularly among the country's schools. ==Historical designs== ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Flags introduced in 1978 Flag Category:National flags Category:Flags with crosses Dominica Category:1978 establishments in Dominica",
