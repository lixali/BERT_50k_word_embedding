Aquino filed this bill so that the president would have to pass a measure through Congress every time that they the chief executive had the impetus to impound part of the budget. Another significant Aquino contribution to the Philippines' corruption problem was Senate Bill 2035, which is the Preservation of Public Infrastructures bill, seeking to raise standards in the construction of all public infrastructures by penalizing contractors of defective infrastructures. The bill also requires the Bureau of Maintenance under the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) to conduct periodic inspections of public infrastructures. Aquino also pushed for the passage of the Amending the Government Procurement Act (SB 2160), which applies to all government procurement activities regardless of source of funds whether local or foreign; only treaties or international/executive agreements entered into by the government prior to its enactment shall be exempt from coverage. The bill was filed in light of the Department of Justice (DOJ) declaration regarding the validity of the NBN–ZTE deal corruption scandal, wherein its international aspect, as well as the fact that it was an executive agreement, was cited as one reason for its exemption from the procurement process stipulated in Republic Act No. 9184. Focusing further on accountability in government appropriations and spending, Aquino filed other reform-oriented bills, among which were Philippine National Police reform; the banning of reappointment to the Judicial and Bar Council; and the prevention of reappointment and bypassing of the Commission on Appointments. == 2010 presidential campaign == thumb|2010 Philippine electoral vote results thumb|Map of dignitaries who attended Aquino's inauguration On November 26, 2008, the Liberal Party elected Mar Roxas, president of the Liberal Party, as the standard-bearer of the Liberal Party for President of the Philippines in the then-upcoming 2010 presidential elections. Following the death and funeral of Aquino's mother, former President Corazon Aquino, many people began calling on Aquino to run for President of the Philippines. This groundswell of support became known as the \"Noynoy Phenomenon\". On August 27, 2009, Edgardo \"Eddie\" Roces, son of the late Chino Roces, publisher and owner of The Manila Times, and a group of lawyers and activists formed the Noynoy Aquino for President Movement (NAPM), a nationwide campaign to collect a million signatures in order to persuade Aquino to run for president, reminiscent of Roces' father, who on October 15, 1985, launched the Cory Aquino for President Movement (CAPM), collecting more than one million signatures nationwide and asking Aquino's mother to run against Ferdinand Marcos in the 1986 presidential snap elections.

A second report came from an unidentified supporter of Senator Manny Villar, the Nacionalistas' leader and presidential candidate. Later presented by Delgado at a press conference, the psychiatric report was supposedly signed by Father Jaime C. Bulatao, S.J., PhD, a Jesuit priest, a professor of Psychology and a clinical psychologist at the Ateneo de Manila University, taken when Aquino was finishing his bachelor's degree in economics at the university in 1979. It reportedly showed that Aquino suffered from depression and melancholia, the priest later denied writing the document at all. Another supposed psychiatric report that later surfaced claimed that Aquino suffered from major depressive disorder; the report's supposed author, Jesuit priest Father Carmelo A. Caluag II, denied writing any evaluations of Aquino. The university's psychology department later debunked the documents, with Aquino labelling them as another desperate effort by rivals to malign his reputation.

He met with the MILF in Tokyo, Japan in August 2011 to initiate peace talks which resulted to the signing of the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro between the Philippine government and the rebel group the following year. The agreement started the process of replacing the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) with a new political entity. In 2014, the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB) was signed between the Philippine government and the MILF, with the deal characterized as a \"final peace agreement\" between the two parties. The CAB paved way for the drafting of the Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL; later known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law or BOL), a charter for a proposed Bangsamoro autonomous region which would replace the ARMM. In 2015, President Aquino was accused of evading responsibility for the Mamasapano clash, a botched police operation, which resulted to the death of 44 Special Action Force officers. He was also criticized for entrusting the operation to suspended police chief Alan Purisima.Pres. Aquino Trying to Evade Liability in Mamasapano Incident According to Sen. Santiago.

This added two years to the basic education system; which became known as the Senior High School stage. The program was introduced because the Philippines was among the three countries in the world at that time still had a 10-year basic education program. Among the criticisms of the K-12 program is the associated costs to be shouldered by teachers, parents, and students for the additional two years of basic education as well as the lack of classrooms and teachers required for the implementation of the shift to K-12. ===Foreign policy=== Benigno Aquino III is noted for his confrontational foreign policy against China, especially concerning the Philippines' approach in pursuing its claims in the South China Sea. It was under his administration, that the China v. Philippines case was filed in the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) which ruled in 2016 the invalidity of China's nine-dash line claim which covers the entire sea, although China continues to disregard the decision. The case was filed in 2013, after the Philippines lost control of the Scarborough Shoal after the 2012 standoff with China over the dispute feature.

Aquino ordered a \"thorough investigation\" into the incident, and would wait until it is completed before deciding whether anyone should lose his or her job.

A play on the term planking and Aquino's nickname, Noynoying involved posing in a lazy manner, such as sitting idly while resting his head on one hand, and doing nothing. === Cabinet === Sources: {| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible autocollapse\" |- !

After leaving office, Aquino remained silent on the Duterte administration and rarely made public appearances. However, in November 2016, Aquino attended a concert at Rizal Park and joined protests against the burial of Ferdinand Marcos. In February 2017, Aquino commemorated the 31st anniversary of the People Power Revolution by marching to the People Power Monument and joining the protests against the Ferdinand Marcos regime. === Legal charges === In July 2017, criminal charges were filed against Aquino for usurpation of authority under the Revised Penal Code and violating anti- graft and corruption laws. Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales cited the involvement of then suspended Philippine National Police chief Alan Purisima in the 2015 Mamasapano police operation against the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in Mamasapano, Maguindanao, where 44 Special Action Force members were killed. Under the Revised Penal Code, suspended public officials cannot perform their duties or interfere in government affairs. Aquino's former Deputy Presidential Spokesperson Abigail Valte said that Aquino planned to file a motion for reconsideration to appeal the charges. On 22 August 2019, the Sandiganbayan dropped the charges against Aquino upon request from Ombudsman Samuel Martires, citing the rule that no president can be charged of inducing subordinates to follow orders. In 2018, Aquino was indicted in a $1.35-billion criminal case involving a congressional approval to use state funds on major government projects. However, the Supreme Court of the Philippines already ruled earlier with finality back in 2015 on the multiple petitions (G.R. Nos. 209135, 209136, 209155, 209164, 209260, 209442, 209517, and 209569) filed against the former president's Disbursement Allocation Programme or DAP. There were different respondents to the case, such as the President, Sec. Abad, Sec. Ochoa, et al. Under the umbrella G.R. No. 209287, the Supreme Court en banc has decided on the following rulings: 1\\. There's no actual case of controversy and grave abuse of discretion by the Executive Department, including the President and concerned department secretaries in the different petitions filed 2\\. All grounds made by the different petitioners cannot stand in the highest court 3\\. The decision of the court were not based on the 116 projects/cases of DAP, but on the constitutionality of the DAP itself 4\\. Not all 116 DAP cases (projects) were covered under the Government Appropriations Act (GAA) 5\\. The President has powers to transfer savings to other departments pursuant to his constitutional powers 6\\. Although only Congress has the rights to appropriate unallocated funds, the President's veto powers to use the funds only under the condition that projects are defined in the GAA and that revenue of respective departments exceed their targets 7\\. The DAP was indeed unconstitutional as procedural, but the court does not invalidate all of the 116 DAP cases in question 8\\. The justices en banc's decision did find doubtful those projects that appeared to have no appropriation cover under the relevant GAA 9\\. The justices en banc failed to declare unconstitutional and illegal all moneys under the DAP used for alleged augmentation of appropriation items that didn't have actual deficiencies (programs, activities and projects or PAP) The case filed in the Office of the Ombudsman did not progress forward due to an earlier dismissal of the Supreme Court in 2015 of any wrong-doing or grave abuse of powers and the declaration of the DAP as unconstitutional on a number of the cases in the 116 programs, activities and projects (PAPs) contained in the budget submitted to Congress from 2012 to 2014. == Personal life == Aquino never married and had no children, making him the Philippines' first bachelor president. Aquino previously had a relationship with Shalani Soledad, a Valenzuela metropolitan councilor and niece of former Senator Francisco Tatad. In November 2010, Aquino confirmed that he and Soledad had ended their relationship. He had previously dated Korina Sanchez, Bernadette Sembrano, and Liz Uy. He was also in a relationship with Korean television host Grace Lee. Aquino had openly stated that he preferred younger women because he wanted to have children. Aquino was also an enthusiast of shooting, billiards, and video games. Aquino did not drink alcoholic beverages but was a chain smoker. Aquino also said that he was not keen on being a poster boy for anti-smoking campaigns. Upon winning the election, Aquino received a phone call from U.S. President Barack Obama, who congratulated him and offered assistance to smoking cessation. Although his official residence as president was Malacañang Palace, Aquino chose to reside in the Bahay Pangarap (House of Dreams), located within the Palace grounds, while in office.Noynoy's new home is Bahay Pangarap – The Philippine Star \" News \" Headlines .

Retrieved on January 23, 2012. == Illness and death == Speculation surrounding Aquino's health began circulating in August 2019 after he was unable to attend the commemoration of his father's 36th death anniversary; however, his spokesperson Abigail Valte said that his illness then was \"nothing serious\". In November 2019, Aquino was reported to have suffered from pneumonia. A month after, he was confined at Makati Medical Center for an executive checkup and undisclosed routine procedures. Aquino was confined in an intensive care unit, although according to his spokesperson, he was never in critical condition and the accommodation was just to limit visitors. Senator Francis Pangilinan, who was Aquino's former food security czar, later stated that this confinement was due to a kidney malfunction. Pangilinan added that Aquino had also been suffering from hypertension and diabetes. Thereafter, Aquino regularly sought medical treatment for his condition. By May 2021, Aquino told Camille Elemia of Rappler that he was experiencing a loss of appetite and breathing difficulties. That same month, he reportedly underwent a cardiac surgery. In the early hours of June 24, 2021, Aquino was found by his maidservant lying unconscious on his recliner at his home in West Triangle, Quezon City. He was immediately transported by ambulance to the nearby Capitol Medical Center in Diliman, where he was pronounced dead at 6:30 a.m. (PHT), that day (22:30 UTC of the previous day). The cause of death was stated as renal disease, secondary to diabetes. According to his personal chauffeur, Aquino was scheduled to undergo dialysis on June 21, but refused because he felt that his body was \"weak\". Another dialysis was planned the day prior to his death, but Aquino again turned it down for similar reasons. Aquino's former public works secretary, Rogelio Singson, stated that he also underwent angioplasty to prepare for a scheduled kidney transplantation; Aquino was in the process of searching for donors at the time of his death. His remains were cremated on the day of his death and his ashes were buried adjacent to that of his parents at the Manila Memorial Park in Parañaque on June 26, making him the first former Philippine president to have been cremated. Three Masses were held on June 25–26 at the Church of the Gesù at his alma mater, the Ateneo de Manila University, where a public viewing was also held. Then-newly installed Manila Archbishop Jose Advincula blessed his remains, while his funeral mass was presided over by Lingayen–Dagupan Archbishop Socrates Villegas (who also presided the requiem mass for Aquino's mother in 2009 when Villegas was Bishop of Balanga), with Caloocan Bishop Pablo Virgilio David concelebrating. Aquino's grave marker is in the same style as his parents: a simple, grey marble plaque with his name, nickname, and the dates of birth and death inscribed in black. A few hours after the announcement of Aquino's death, President Rodrigo Duterte declared a ten-day \"period of national mourning\" from June 24 to July 3. All national flags have been flown at half-mast as a sign of mourning. The funeral rites of Aquino were covered by Radyo Katipunan, the radio arm of his alma mater, for the wake and Radio Television Malacañang for his burial. ==Approval ratings== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |+ SWS Net satisfaction ratings of |- ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Date ! scope=\"col\" | Rating |- ! scope=\"row\" | Sep 2010 | +60 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Nov 2010 | +64 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Mar 2011 | +51 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Jun 2011 | +46 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Sep 2011 | +56 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Dec 2011 | +58 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Mar 2012 | +49 |- ! scope=\"row\" | May 2012 | +42 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Aug 2012 | +67 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Dec 2012 | +55 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Mar 2013 | +59 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Jun 2013 | +64 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Sep 2013 | +49 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Dec 2013 | +49 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Mar 2014 | +45 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Jun 2014 | +25 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Sep 2014 | +34 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Dec 2014 | +39 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Mar 2015 | +11 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Jun 2015 | +30 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Sep 2015 | +41 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Dec 2015 | +32 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Apr 2016 | +27 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Jun 2016 | +29 |- class=\"sortbottom\" ! scope=\"row\" | Average | +45 |} == Honors and awards == This is a list of honors and awards received by Benigno Aquino III.
