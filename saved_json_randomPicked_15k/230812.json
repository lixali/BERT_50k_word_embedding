 "text": "Private Pluto is a 1943 propaganda comedy cartoon produced by Walt Disney Productions. In this cartoon Pluto is in the army and he gets antagonized by two chipmunks, later known as Chip 'n' Dale, in their first official appearance. While the chipmunks became regular antagonists of Donald Duck, they did continue to pester Pluto in Squatter's Rights (1946) and one last time in Pluto's Christmas Tree (1952). ==Plot== This short showcases Pluto as a soldier during the World War II when he is a guard dog on a U.S military base. He is told there are saboteurs, and is assigned to guard a pill-box (gun emplacement). First, Pluto tries to follow marching orders, contorting himself into quite a mess. Then, he engages in hijinks with two chipmunks who are using a cannon to store and crack their nuts, and a war of wits naturally ensues. ==Voice cast== *Pluto: Pinto Colvig *Dale: Dessie Flynn *Chip: James MacDonald ==Home media== The short was released on May 18, 2004, on Walt Disney Treasures: Walt Disney on the Front Lines and on December 7, 2004, on Walt Disney Treasures: The Complete Pluto: 1930-1947. ==References== #Ultimate Disney ==External links== * Category:1943 animated films Category:1943 films Category:American films Category:1940s Disney animated short films Category:Films scored by Oliver Wallace Category:Films directed by Clyde Geronimi Category:Films produced by Walt Disney Category:Pluto (Disney) short films Category:RKO Pictures animated short films Category:World War II films made in wartime",
