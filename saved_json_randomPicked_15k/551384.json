 "text": "Aigio, also written as Aeghion, Aegion, Aegio, Egio (, ; ), is a town and a former municipality in Achaea, West Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform, it is part of the municipality Aigialeia, of which it is the seat and a municipal unit. Aigio is the second largest city in Achaea after Patras. The municipal unit has an area of 151.101 km2. It has a population of around 26,000 while the municipality has about 49,000 inhabitants. Aigio is a port town on the Gulf of Corinth, and takes its name from the ancient city of Aegium. ==Geography== The southwestern part of the municipality consists of the foothills of the Panachaiko mountain. The river Selinountas flows into the Gulf of Corinth in Valimitika, 5 km east of Aigio town centre. ==History== ===Antiquity=== Before the founding of the city, the area had a Neolithic settlement. The city of Aigion was founded during Homeric times and became part of the first Achaean League since around 800 BC. The city had several Olympic winners, including Xenophon, Ladas (stadion race), Athenodorus (Αθηνόδωρος, stadion race), Straton (Στράτων, pancration and wrestling). After the disaster of Helike, which was destroyed by an earthquake and buried by a tsunami in 373 BC, Aigion took the territory of the neighbouring city. The ruins of Helike were discovered in 2000 off the coast in the Corinthian Gulf and are sometimes connected to Plato's Atlantis myth. Archeologists are excavating the site. From 330 BC, Aigion was for fifty years under the Kingdom of Macedon. Around the year 275 BC the people expelled the Macedonian garrison and the city joined the new Achaean League. With the famous temple of Zeus Homarios, Aigion became the Achaean assembly place. It remained their capital until the Roman conquest in 146 BC. After the annexation of Achaia, the Romans removed the wall of the city and Aegium lost its importance. ===Byzantine era=== After the division of the Roman Empire in 395 AD, Aegium became a part of the Eastern Roman Empire and later the Byzantine Empire. Later, in 805 it was captured by Slavic tribes during the Slavic invasions. Probably between 9th and 13th century it was renamed to Vostitsa (Βοστίτσα). In the Chronicle of the Morea (14th century), it is first mentioned with this new name. The following centuries the name is found in various documents having different spelling forms like Bostizza, Ligustizza, Bostitza, Bostiza, Vostizza. Some scholars interpret the name as having a Slavic origin. The German linguist and Slavicist Max Vasmer gives two possible interpretations,Max Vasmer: Die Slawen in Griechenland. Verlag der Akademie der Wissenschaften, Berlin 1941. one from the word Voščica (Voštane, slaven. Vošče) and one from the word ovoštь, meaning \"fructus\" or \"garden\". Dionysios Zakythinos, a Greek scholar of Byzantium, gives a similar interpretation explaining the name as \"fruit- bearing place\".Διονύσιος Α. Ζακυθηνός, Οι Σλάβοι εν Ελλάδι. Συμβολαί εις τήν Ίστορίαν τοϋ Μεσαιωνικού Ελληνισμού. Αετός, Αθήναι 1945: \"Βοστίτσα: Τόπος οπωροφόρος\". Christos Coryllos, in his detailed \"Description of Greece\", had given another interpretation. He writes that after the plague epidemic, numerous Avar or Slav shepherds migrated to this area. One of their leaders had the name \"Vostitzas\", from whom the town later took its name.Χρ. Κορύλλου, Χωρογραφίας της Ελλάδος, Α´, Νομός Αχαϊας, Αθήναι 1903. 19th-century German writer Joseph Baron Ow, in his book Die Abstammung der Griechen und die Irrthümer und Täuschungen des Dr. Ph. Fallmerayer,Ow, Joseph. Die Abstammung Der Griechen Und Die Irrthümer Und Täuschungen Des Dr. Ph. Fallmerayer: Mit Einem Anhange Ueber Sprache, Volk & Fremdenherrschaft in Griechenland. München: Georg Franz, 1848 (in German) written in 1846, gives a completely different interpretation. He writes that the name Bostiza is a diminutive form (typical in Greek language) of the word Bosta which comes from the French word Bastion (middle French Bastillon). From Βosta comes the word Bostan/Bostani which is common in Greek and Turkish language and it means garden (though many linguists name Bosta as of Persian origin). ===Frankish and Ottoman era=== The city was captured by the Crusaders in the early 13th century and became the seat of a barony of the Principality of Achaea. In the early 15th century, it was conquered by the Despotate of the Morea. thumb|left|Vostizza, formerly Egio, 1820 illustration by Pomardi Simone In 1459 it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire, who ruled it until the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence, except for brief interruptions by the Venetians from 1463 until 1470, and from 1685 until 1715. The city was captured by the Greek rebels on 26 March 1821, becoming one of the first towns to be liberated from Ottoman rule. In July 1822, at Akrata, near the town, a force of Greek fighters under Londos, Zaimis and Petimezas surrounded and attacked a group of 4000 Turks marching to Patras, after their defeat at the Battle of Dervenakia. Only a few Turks were lucky to escape when Yusuf Pasha sent ships to take them to Patras. After Greek Independence, the town was officially renamed to its ancient name. ===Modern era=== On June 15, 1995, a serious earthquake destroyed many buildings and damaged roads in the downtown and southwestern sections,Journal of Geodynamics Vol. 26, Issues 2-4, 1998, Pages 487-499 \"Egio earthquake (15 June 1995): An episode in the neotectonic evolution of Corinthiakos Gulf\" with a number of casualties. The earthquake shattered Aigio: small memorials are found throughout the city, with candles aglow day and night to remember the victims. The mountainous countryside near Aigio was severely damaged by the 2007 Greek forest fires. ==Landmarks and sights== *The church of Panagia Tripiti is a notable attraction. It is a national sacred shrine dedicated to the Theotokos, God-bearer or Mother of God, the Life Giving Spring.

The ferry service was limited, with only three ferries daily. The trip was 45 minutes long. In May 2011, the shipping company that operated the ferry announced that it was suspending the ferry because of financial reasons. An electric ferry is planned. The port also has railroad tracks, but the Hellenic Railways Organisation (OSE) announced suspension of service in Aigio and across the Pelopponese in January 2011. As of 2020, a new double standard-gauge railway line connects Aigio with Kiato and Athens. The new Aigio railway station lies at the east outskirts of the city. It opened in 22 June 2020 and few days later it was inaugurated by the minister of transportation of Greece.Kiato- Aigio railway section to re-open on 22/6 after almost ten years, article in ypodomes.com online infrastructure magazine (18 June 2020) Roads serving the city are Motorway 8 (Greece) (Athens-Corinth-Patras) and Greek National Road 31 (Aigio - Kalavryta). ==Infrastructure and economy== thumb|Port of Aigio, View of the new pier thumb|Port of Aigio, old pier thumb|View from the sea Aigio, along with Patras and Piraeus, has been one of the main export hubs for Corinthian raisins since the 19th century. In the book Geography of Greece - Achaia (1903) by Christos Coryllos, Χρ. Κορυλλου, Χωρογραφία της Ελλάδος, Α´, Νομός Αχαϊας, Αθήναι, 1903 it is mentioned that the area of Aigio produced 7.5-10 million Kgs of raisins and 600 thousand kgs of olive oil annually. Today the port is used as a fruit import hub for Chiquita Brands International, mainly for the importation of bananas. A new 256 m-long pier northwest of the existing port was inaugurated on 7 August 2013. The whole project cost 8.6 million Euros and is intended to enhance trade and tourism opportunities for the city. Aigio houses two branch departments of the Technological Educational Institute of Patras, the department of Physiotherapy and the Optics and Optometry department. The Aigio General Hospital is situated a few kilometres out of the town and has a capacity of 100 beds. The Hospital performs the greatest number of laparoscopic surgeries in Greece, while more than 50,000 people are examined on a yearly basis. ==Sports== Aigio has a football stadium called \"Municipal Stadium of Aigion\", which has a capacity of ~7,000 (4,500 seats).Stadia: Aeghio, Gov't of Greece It was built in 1951 and was last renovated in 1999.
