 "text": "thumb|right|800px|Timeline of Malaysian political parties with origins from UMNO since 1946 This is a list of political parties in Malaysia, including existing and historical ones. ==Legislation== Under the current legislation, all political parties (termed \"Political Associations\") must be registered under the Societies Act. ===Election expenses=== The Election Offences Act (1954) regulates the maximum expenses allowed for candidates vying for parliamentary seats and for state seats during the campaign period (excluding before the nomination day and after election day). The permissible campaign expenditure set by the Election Offences Act (1954) is RM100,000 per candidate for state seats and RM200,000 per candidate for federal seats. According to this guideline, with 505 state seats and 222 parliamentary seats in the 2013 general election, the maximum amount that Barisan Nasional was allowed to spend was only about RM95 million. Due to the lack of records and regulations, Malaysian politicians may not even know how much they spent on their campaigns or overspending the expenditure than permitted by law. Another related problem was the secrecy surrounding political funds and their use. Although many politicians, including members of newly appointed cabinets, voluntarily disclosed their personal finances, such disclosure is not compulsory and many sources of revenue remain obscure. ===Election deposits=== The deposit was RM10,000 to contest a parliamentary seat, or RM5,000 to contest a state assembly seat. The deposit is used to pay for infringements of election laws and is returned after polling day unless the candidate loses and fails to garner more than 12.5 percent or one-eighth of the votes cast. Additionally it is required that each candidate provide a RM5,000 deposit for cleaning up banners and posters after the election. ===Political donations=== Political donations are legal in Malaysia. There is no limit, and parties are not obliged to disclose the source of the funding, which makes political donations a vague subject but still entirely legal in the country. All political donations are allowed to be given into accounts of individuals and accounts of the political party. Anonymous donors and foreigners may request to not to reveal their identities. Political parties are funded by contributions from: * party members and individual supporters (via membership fees/dues/subscriptions and/or local/foreign small donations), * organisations, which share their political views (e.g. by trade union affiliation fees) or which stand to benefit from their activities (e.g. by local/foreign corporate donations) or * taxpayers respectively the general revenue fund (by grants that are called state aid, government or public funding). ==Latest election results== ==The parties== ===Parties represented in the Parliament and/or the state legislative assemblies=== This is the list of coalitions and parties that have representation in the Parliament of Malaysia (Dewan Rakyat & Dewan Negara) and/or the state legislative assemblies, sorted by seats held in the Dewan Rakyat, the lower house of the Parliament of Malaysia.

Some members of the original PRM re-organised PRM as a functional political party in 2005 after some disagreement on the ideology and direction of the newly merged party, PKR.
