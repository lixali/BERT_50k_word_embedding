Lipstadt's legal defense team was led by Anthony Julius of Mishcon de Reya while Penguin's was led by Kevin Bays and Mark Bateman of Davenport Lyons. Both defendants instructed Richard Rampton QC while Penguin also instructed Heather Rogers as junior counsel. The expert witnesses for the defence included Cambridge historian Richard J. Evans, Christopher Browning, Robert Jan van Pelt, and Peter Longerich. English libel law places the burden of proof on the defendant rather than the plaintiff. Lipstadt and Penguin won the case using the justification defense, namely by demonstrating in court that Lipstadt's accusations against Irving were substantially true and therefore not libelous. The case was argued as a bench trial before Mr Justice Gray, who produced a written judgment 349 pages long detailing Irving's systematic distortion of the historical record of World War II. The Times (April 14, 2000, p. 23) said of Lipstadt's victory, \"History has had its day in court and scored a crushing victory.\"Holocaust Denial On Trial: Holocaust Denial and the 2000 Libel Trial in the U.K. , a project of The Rabbi Donald A. Tam Institute for Jewish Studies at Emory University. Despite her acrimonious history with Irving, Lipstadt has stated that she is personally opposed to the three-year prison sentence Austria imposed on Irving for two speeches he made in 1989, where he claimed there had been no gas chambers at Auschwitz. In Austria, minimizing the atrocities of the Third Reich is a crime punishable with up to 10 years' imprisonment. Speaking of Irving, Lipstadt said, \"I am uncomfortable with imprisoning people for speech. Let him go and let him fade from everyone's radar screens ... Generally, I don't think Holocaust denial should be a crime. I am a free speech person, I am against censorship.\"O'Neill, Brendan. \"Irving? Let the guy go home\" BBC News, January 4, 2006 ==Commentary== In February 2007, Lipstadt warned of \"soft-core denial\" at the Zionist Federation's annual fundraising dinner in London. Referring to groups such as the Muslim Council of Britain, reportedly she stated: \"When groups of people refuse to commemorate Holocaust Memorial Day unless equal time is given to anti-Muslim prejudice, this is soft-core denial.\"Quoted by Jonny Paul, \"Holocaust Scholar Warns of New 'soft- core' Denial\". The Jerusalem Post (February 6, 2007). According to Jonny Paul, \"She received huge applause when she asked how former United States President Jimmy Carter could omit the years 1939–1947 from a chronology in his book\"; referring to his recently published and controversial book Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, she said: \"When a former president of the United States writes a book on the Israeli–Palestinian crisis and writes a chronology at the beginning of the book in order to help them understand the emergence of the situation and in that chronology lists nothing of importance between 1939 and 1947, that is soft-core denial.\" Along the same lines, Lipstadt has criticized the German philosopher and historian Ernst Nolte for engaging in what she calls \"soft-core denial\" of the Holocaust, arguing that Nolte practices an even more dangerous form of negationism than the Holocaust deniers. Speaking of Nolte in a 2003 interview, Lipstadt stated: In late 2011, Lipstadt attacked American and Israeli politicians for what she called their invocation of the Holocaust for contemporary political purposes, something she thought mangled history. She rebuked Republican Party presidential candidates for speeches that 'pandered' to the Evangelical constituency, as much as it did to the Republican Jewish Coalition. She also judged Howard Gutman's remarks on causal links between Muslim antisemitism and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict as \"stupid\". According to Haaretz, \"She decried the 'hysteria' and 'neuroses' of many Jews and Israelis who compare the current situation in Europe and in the Middle East to the Holocaust-era\":Chemi Shalev, \"Top Holocaust scholar blasts 'Holocaust-abuse' by U.S., Israeli politicians\". at Haaretz, December 16, 2011. In the same interview, she argued that \"If anti-Semitism becomes the reason through which your Jewish view of the world is refracted, if it becomes your prism, then it is very unhealthy. Jewish tradition never wanted that.\" She said \"You listen to Newt Gingrich talking about the Palestinians as an 'invented people'—it's out-Aipacking AIPAC, it's out-Israeling Israel\". On a visit to London in September 2014, Lipstadt criticized the Israeli government and said that the government had \"cheapened\" the memory of the Holocaust by using it to justify war. She has also rejected the view that Israeli military actions during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict constituted a genocide. Lipstadt returned to the theme of soft-core Holocaust denial in The Atlantic when responding to the Trump administration's statement on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, January 27, 2017 which was condemned for the absence of a specific mention of Jews, as the principal victims of the Holocaust or of antisemitism itself. \"The Holocaust was de-Judaized. It is possible that it all began with a mistake. Someone simply did not realize what they were doing. It is also possible that someone did this deliberately.\" In February 2019, Lipstadt resigned her membership in the Young Israel synagogue movement because its national council president defended Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's facilitation of a merger between the Bayit Yehudi party and the extremist Otzma Yehudit party. In October 2019, Lipstadt had a letter to the editor published in The New York Times in which, prompted by the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Peter Handke, she wrote that the Nobel Committee awarded Handke a platform \"he does not deserve\" and that \"the public does not need him to have\", adding that such a platform could convince some that his \"false claims must have some legitimacy.\" ==Awards and honors== After the publication of Denying the Holocaust in June 1993, Lipstadt received the 1994 National Jewish Book Award. Already a consultant to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, President Bill Clinton appointed her in 1994 to the United States Holocaust Memorial Council. In 1997, Lipstadt received the Emory Williams teaching award for excellence in teaching. She is also a recipient of the Albert D. Chernin Award from the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, which is given to \"an American Jew whose work best exemplifies the social justice imperatives of Judaism, Jewish history and the protection of the Bill of Rights, particularly the First Amendment.\" Previous recipients of the Award include Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Alan Dershowitz.\"Deborah E. Lipstadt\" Emory College of Arts and Sciences website Lipstadt was awarded the 2005 National Jewish Book Award in the Holocaust category for History on Trial: My Day in Court with a Holocaust Denier and the 2019 National Jewish Book Award in Education and Jewish Identity for Antisemitism: Here and Now. Lipstadt has received honorary doctorates from a number of institutions, including Ohio Wesleyan University, John Jay College of Criminal Justice of the City University of New York, Yeshiva University, and the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, among others. ==Works== ; Autobiographies: * History on Trial: My Day in Court with a Holocaust Denier (2005), memoir ; Biographies: * The Zionist Career of Louis Lipsky, 1900-1921 (1982), Lipstadt's dissertation as a book, written in 1976 ; History: * An outline of American Zionist history 1759–1948 (1971) * Beyond Belief: The American Press and the Coming of the Holocaust, 1933–1945 (1985) * Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory (1993) * The Eichmann Trial (2011) * Holocaust: An American Understanding (2016) * Antisemitism: Here and Now (2018) ==In popular culture== *Actress Rachel Weisz portrayed Lipstadt in Denial (2016),History on Trial: My Day in Court with David Irving a film based on her 2005 book History on Trial: My Day in Court with David Irving, directed by Mick Jackson. ==References== ==External links== * * Deborah Lipstadt Faculty biography at Emory University. * Deborah Lipstadt's blog. * Voices on Antisemitism Podcast Deborah Lipstadt interview and transcript from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (2007) * Holocaust Denial on Trial, a project of the Rabbi Donald A.
