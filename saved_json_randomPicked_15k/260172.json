The town is named after Governor Oliver Wolcott of Connecticut. The Town of Wolcott is in the northeast corner of the county. There are two villages within the town: Wolcott and Red Creek. The town lies west of Syracuse. ==History== The first white colonist settlement began around 1807. Native Americans settled the land many years before. The Town of Wolcott was formed 1807 from the Town of Junius in Seneca County, New York before the creation of Wayne County, but the town was not completely organized until 1810. The land on which the town was formed on was previously inhabited by Cayuga and Onondaga Native Americans, who were exiled by white European colonists. The town was later reduced in size by the formation of new towns in the county: Butler, Huron, and Rose, all in 1826. The discovery of iron ore in the county led to the smelting operation at Wolcott furnace north of Wolcott village from 1821 to 1869. ==Geography== According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 40.2 square miles (104.0 km2), of which, 39.3 square miles (101.8 km2) of it is land and 0.9 square miles (2.2 km2) of it (2.14%) is water.
