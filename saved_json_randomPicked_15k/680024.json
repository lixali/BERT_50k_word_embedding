 "text": "Thomas Lee Kirk (December 10, 1941 – September 28, 2021) was an American actor, best known for his performances in films made by Walt Disney Studios such as Old Yeller, The Shaggy Dog, Swiss Family Robinson, The Absent-Minded Professor, and The Misadventures of Merlin Jones, as well as the beach-party films of the mid-1960s. ==Early career== Kirk was born in Louisville, Kentucky, one of four sons. His father, Louis, was a mechanic who worked for the highway department; his mother, Lucy, was a legal secretary. Looking for better job opportunities, they moved to Downey in Los Angeles County, California, when Kirk was 15 months old.Freida Zylstra, \"Actor Tommy Kirk Tries His Hand in Kitchen\", Chicago Daily Tribune, January 18, 1963: b7.Edwards, Don, \"Disney kid Tommy Kirk a cheerful has-been at 48\", Chicago Tribune, November 6, 1990: N_B7. ===Acting debut=== In 1954, Kirk accompanied his elder brother Joe to an audition for a production of Eugene O'Neill's Ah, Wilderness! at the Pasadena Playhouse in Pasadena, California. \"Joe was star struck,\" said Kirk. Joe was not cast, losing out to Bobby Driscoll, but Tommy was, and he made his stage debut opposite Will Rogers Jr.\"Will Rogers, Jr. Makes Auspicious Stage Debut\", Los Angeles Times, August 21, 1954: 13. \"It was five lines, it didn't pay anything, and nobody else showed up, so I got the part,\" said Kirk. The performance was seen by an agent from the Gertz agency, who signed Kirk and succeeded in casting him in an episode of TV Reader's Digest, \"The Last of the Old Time Shooting Sheriffs\", directed by William Beaudine. Kirk's brother went on to become a dentist. ===Television=== Kirk began to work steadily in television throughout 1956 and 1957 in episodes of Lux Video Theatre (\"Green Promise\"), Frontier (\"The Devil and Doctor O'Hara\"), Big Town (\"Adult Delinquents\"), Crossroads (\"The Rabbi Davis Story\"), Gunsmoke (\"Cow Doctor\"), Letter to Loretta (\"But for God's Grace\", \"Little League\") and Matinee Theatre (\"The Outing\", \"The Others\" - a version of Turn of the Screw). According to Diabolique magazine, \"Kirk was in heavy demand as an actor almost immediately. Watching his early performances it’s easy to see why — he was wide-eyed, gangly, keen, and immensely likeable ... the very picture of Eisenhower-era American youth, unaffected and natural, surprisingly non- annoying, extremely easy to cast as someone’s kid brother, or son, or neighbour.\" Kirk also supported Angie Dickinson in a short feature called Down Liberty Road, a.k.a. Freedom Highway (1956), a short commercial travelogue produced by Greyhound Lines to promote their Scenicruiser buses. Of these early experiences, Kirk especially liked working on Matinee Theatre: > I did 37 of those in the next five years. I think I did more than any other > actor. That was a fantastic training ground. They were hour-long shows, > telecast live from coast to coast. I worked with some fascinating people — > Sarah Churchill and others — and I started getting known.Jones interview ==Disney== ===The Hardy Boys=== In April 1956, Kirk auditioned for the part of Joe Hardy for The Mickey Mouse Club serial \"The Hardy Boys: The Mystery of the Applegate Treasure\". He was successful and was selected to co-star with Tim Considine. The show was filmed in June and early July 1956, and broadcast that October, at the start of the show's second season. The show and Kirk's performance were extremely well received and led to a long association between the actor and the studio. In August 1956, Disney hired him and the former Mouseketeer Judy Harriet to attend both the Republican and Democratic presidential nominating conventions, for newsreel specials that later appeared on the show. Kirk also hosted short travelogues for the serial segment of the show's second season. He did the voice-over narration for \"The Eagle Hunters\" and then co-hosted two more travelogues with Annette Funicello. Kirk also did voice-dubbing work for the Danish-made film Vesterhavsdrenge, shown on the Mickey Mouse Club as the serial \"Boys of the Western Sea\". Around this time, it was announced that Kirk would appear as Young Davy Crockett, but this did not happen. ===Old Yeller=== Kirk's career received its biggest break yet when, in January 1957, Disney cast him as Travis Coates in Old Yeller (1957), an adventure story about a boy and his heroic dog. Kirk had the lead role in the film, a success at the box-office, and he became Disney's first choice whenever they needed someone to play an all-American teenager. Kevin Corcoran played his younger brother and the two of them were often cast as brothers. Both Kirk and Corcoran were announced for the cast of Rainbow Road to Oz, a feature film based on the stories of L. Frank Baum, but this film was never produced.\"Movie Producers Crashing Broadway\", The Washington Post and Times Herald, September 3, 1957: B8. Kirk appeared in another Hardy brothers installment, the original story The Mystery of Ghost Farm (September 13 – December 20, 1957). He continued to guest star on television series, such as The O. Henry Playhouse (\"Christmas by Injunction\"), The Californians (as Billy Kilgore in \"Little Lost Man\"), Matinee Theatre (\"Look Out for John Tucker\"), and Playhouse 90 (\"A Corner of the Garden\"). He provided the voice, along with Sandra Dee, for the U.S. version of a Soviet animated feature, The Snow Queen (1957). ===The Shaggy Dog and Swiss Family Robinson=== In July 1958, Kirk was cast in The Shaggy Dog (1959), a comedy about a boy inventor, who under the influence of a magic ring, is repeatedly transformed into an Old English Sheepdog.Scheuer, Philip K., \"'Shaggy Dog' Cast Will Kid Monsters: Jean Hagen Completes Roster; New Film Faster, Less Distorted\", Los Angeles Times, July 30, 1958: A9. This teamed him with Corcoran and two other Disney stars with whom he regularly worked, Fred MacMurray and Annette Funicello. According to Diabolique, \"Much of the credit went to MacMurray; a lot of the credit should have gone to Kirk, whose easy-going boy next door charm made him the ideal American teen.\" Kirk said that when filming finished, Disney told him they did not have any projects for him and he was being dropped. \"I was thin and gangly and looked a mess ... I thought the whole world had fallen to pieces,\" he said. He returned to TV, appearing in The Millionaire ('Millionaire Charles Bradwell\") (1959) and Bachelor Father (\"A Key for Kelly\"). Shaggy Dog turned out to be a hit, gaining significantly larger rentals than Old Yeller, and Disney soon contacted Kirk, offering him another long-term contract and a role as middle son Ernst Robinson in another adventure film, Swiss Family Robinson (1960), starring John Mills, Dorothy McGuire, Janet Munro, and Corcoran. It remained Kirk's favorite movie.Minton p 69 When he returned from filming in the West Indies, the studio signed him to two more movies.Scheuer, Philip K., \"Hersey 'War Lover' Sold to Columbia: Directors Picks Annual Critic; U.S. Steel Sponsors a Winner\", Los Angeles Times, January 25, 1960: C9. In 1959, Film Daily called Kirk one of its five \"male juveniles\" of the year (the others being Tim Considine, Ricky Nelson, Eddie Hodges, and James MacArthur).Stewart, Hepburn; Scheuer, Philip K, \"Top poll of Critics: Welch, Peggy Cass also rate; Millie Perkins Is No. 1 find\", Los Angeles Times, December 28, 1959: C9. In 1959, a friend and he were almost killed in a car crash in Arizona. \"The car was totally demolished, but we didn't get a scratch,\" he said later. \"How do you explain that?\"Nott, Robert, \"The Big Picture Takes On Film\", The Santa Fe New Mexican, March 10, 2006: PA-48. ===Disney comedies=== Kirk next followed up with a secondary role in a fantasy comedy starring Fred MacMurray, The Absent-Minded Professor (1961). It was another huge hit.Scheuer, Philip K.,\"Realist Disney Kept His Dreams: Walt Disney Held His Dreams\", Los Angeles Times, June 26, 1960: F1. Disney sent Kirk to England for The Horsemasters (1961), a youth-oriented horse riding film, which was made for U.S. television, but screened theatrically in some markets. He appeared once more with Munro and Funicello. Kirk guested on Angel (\"Goodbye Young Lovers\"), and for Disney played the support role of Grumio in the fairy tale fantasy Babes in Toyland, supporting Funicello, Ray Bolger, Ed Wynn and Tommy Sands. Kirk later described this film as \"sort of a klunker ... but it has a few cute moments, it's an oddity\", and enjoyed working with Ed Wynn.Minton p 70 It was a box-office disappointment; so too was Moon Pilot (1962), a satirical comedy for Disney where Kirk played the younger brother of Tom Tryon.John C. Waugh, \"A Legendary Tale Spinner Looks Ahead -- British TV adjusts a balance: Disney boosting live-action films\", The Christian Science Monitor, March 14, 1961: 6. Diabolique reported, \"Both these films were box- office disappointments and would have been better had Kirk been given more to do – or, come to think of it, played the male lead, instead of Tommy Sands and Tom Tryon, respectively. Male actors who excel in light comedy were exceedingly rare, then as now, as Disney was coming to appreciate.\" Kirk acted in a family comedy with MacMurray, Bon Voyage (1962), with other family members played by Jane Wyman, Deborah Walley, and Corcoran. MacMurray once reportedly gave Kirk \"the biggest dressing-down of my life\" during the filming, one that Kirk says he deserved. Kirk: > I really liked him [MacMurray] very much, but the feeling wasn't mutual. > That hurt me a lot and for a long time I hated him. It's hard not to hate > somebody who doesn't like you. I was sort of looking for a father figure and > I pushed him too hard. He resented it and I guess I was pretty repellent to > him, so we didn't get along. We had a couple of blow ups on set ... He was a > nice person, but I was just too demanding. I came on too strong because I > desperately wanted to be his friend.Minton p 71 Kirk also had trouble with Jane Wyman, saying: \"She was very mean to me. She went out of her way to be shitty ... but she was a total bitch and I think she was homophobic.\"' Kirk maintained good relationships, though, with other actors with whom he worked. \"Tommy played my brother in a lot of films and put up with a lot of things that I did to him over the years,\" Corcoran says in a commentary on the DVD release of Old Yeller. \"He must be a great person not to hate me.\" Tim Considine calls Kirk \"a monster talent\". Kirk starred with Funicello in another overseas-shot story which screened in the United States on TV, but was released in some countries theatrically: Escapade in Florence (1962). Newspaper columns occasionally linked Kirk and Funicello's names romantically.\"Soraya Is Denying Marriage Plans\", The Washington Post, Times Herald, November 6, 1963: D14. Kirk always spoke highly of her: > A perfect lady, perfect manners, very careful about her career, a very cool- > headed businesswoman, friendly. We've always been friendly, but never been > friends ... But nobody can fault her, she's always friendly and gracious to > everybody. People say bad things about everybody in this business, but I > don't know anybody who ever said anything bad about her. In July 1962, Disney announced they would make The Happiest American with Kirk, but it was not made.Hopper, Hedda, \"Art Linkletter off to Russia, hopes he won't encounter complications of last trip\", Los Angeles Times, July 2, 1962: C10 Instead, he did a sequel to Absent Minded Professor, Son of Flubber (1963), his last film with MacMurray. Kirk guest-starred on an episode of Mr. Novak, \"Love in the Wrong Season\" (1963). He was given the lead in Disney's Savage Sam (1963), a follow-up to Old Yeller, which reunited him with Corcoran and co-starred Brian Keith; it was not as well received as Old Yeller. He also guest-starred in \"Ten Minutes from Now\", an episode of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour (1964). ===Misadventures of Merlin Jones=== Disney then cast Kirk as \"scrambled egghead\" student inventor Merlin Jones in The Misadventures of Merlin Jones (1964), opposite Funicello. The film was directed by Robert Stevenson, who was frequently assigned Disney comedies. It became an unexpected box-office sensation and was one of the biggest hits of the year. Kirk said that he only met Walt Disney outside the studio one time, at a party. Kirk said that Disney called him his \"good luck charm\". ==Leaving Disney== Kirk said he knew he was gay from an early age: > I consider my teenaged years as being desperately unhappy. I knew I was gay, > but I had no outlet for my feelings. It was very hard to meet people and, at > that time, there was no place to go to socialize. It wasn't until the early > '60s that I began to hear of places where gays congregated. The lifestyle > was not recognized and I was very, very lonely. Oh, I had some brief, very > passionate encounters and as a teenager I had some affairs, but they were > always stolen, back alley kind of things. They were desperate and miserable. > When I was about 17 or 18 years old, I finally admitted to myself that I > wasn't going to change. I didn't know what the consequences would be, but I > had the definite feeling that it was going to wreck my Disney career and > maybe my whole acting career. It was all going to come to an end.Minton p 68 While filming The Misadventures of Merlin Jones in 1963, Kirk was caught having sex with a boy at a swimming pool in Burbank. The boy's mother informed Disney, who elected not to renew Kirk's contract. Walt Disney personally fired Kirk. Kirk was also using drugs. He later described the situation: > \"Even more than MGM, Disney was the most conservative studio in town. ... > The studio executives were beginning to suspect my homosexuality. Certain > people were growing less and less friendly. In 1963, Disney let me go. But > Walt asked me to return for the final Merlin Jones movie, The Monkey's > Uncle, because the Jones films had been moneymakers for the studio.\" ===AIP=== The news of Kirk's termination from Disney Studios was not made public, but Kirk was soon working for American International Pictures (AIP), which needed a leading man to co-star with Funicello in a musical they were preparing, The Maid and the Martian; Kirk was cast as a Martian who arrives on Earth and falls in with a bunch of partying teenagers. The movie was later retitled Pajama Party (1964) and was a box-office hit. In the meantime The Misadventures of Merlin Jones had become an unexpected smash hit, earning $4 million in rentals in North America, and Disney invited Funicello and him back to make a sequel, The Monkey's Uncle (1965).Scheuer, Philip K., \"Disney Announces Diverse Schedule: Doris Day Winner (Again); Ill Wind a Boon to Actors\", Los Angeles Times, January 4, 1965: B7. ===Drug arrest=== On Christmas Eve 1964, Kirk was arrested for suspicion of possession of marijuana at a house in Hollywood. The district attorney's office subsequently refused to file a complaint against him on the marijuana charge. The city attorney's office, however, filed an illegal drugs charge, because officers found a vial of barbiturates in his car. This charge was dismissed by a judge in early January when Kirk's attorney established that the barbiturates had been prescribed by a physician. \\- \"Tommy Kirk cleared of drug charge\", Los Angeles Times, January 5, 1965: b6. However, the damage to his career had been done. He was replaced on How to Stuff a Wild Bikini (1965) by Dwayne Hickman (intended as AIP's follow-up to Pajama Party), on The Sons of Katie Elder by Michael Anderson, Jr. and on Beach Ball by Edd Byrnes. His initial casting in these films was announced in late 1964.Scheuer, Philip K., \"Nichols will direct Hollywood Woolf: Warner typewriters click; That U.S. image favorable\", Los Angeles Times, December 14, 1964: B13. \\- \"First Writers Guild Winners Announced\", Los Angeles Times, November 25, 1964: C5. \"This town is full of right-wingers—the world is full of right- wingers—intolerant, cruel sons-of-bitches\", Kirk said later, but he also said later that he \"richly deserved to be fired from the studios because of my irresponsibility. A person on drugs is not fit for work\". For the moment, Kirk could still get work. He appeared in Village of the Giants (1965) for director Bert I. Gordon, alongside Beau Bridges and Ron Howard. Kirk later described it as \"kind of a crazy movie, but the production values are pretty good and it sort of holds together. I could have done without the dancing ducks, though\". In September 1965, Kirk made a beach party/crime film for Executive Pictures Corp, Catalina CaperMartin, Betty, \"Shaw rejoins film colony\", Los Angeles Times, August 18, 1965: D10 released in 1967. The Monkey's Uncle came out in July 1965 and was almost as successful as Merlin Jones. AIP cast him in The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini (1966) with Deborah Walley. Soon after, Walley and he were put in It's a Bikini World, filmed in late 1965 under the direction of Stephanie Rothman. It was not released until 1967.Martin, Betty.\"Wolper to film war novel\", Los Angeles Times, October 20, 1965: D15. Also for AIP, he appeared in a TV special, The Wild Weird World of Dr. Goldfoot (1965), made to promote Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine, which aired in November 1965\\. In December, he announced he would make three more films for Exclusive, starting with Teacher, Teacher, alongside Bob Denver and Dawn WellsBetty Martin, \"Franciosa set for Swinger\", Los Angeles Times, December 18, 1965: a12. but the film would not be made. ===Larry Buchanan=== The releases of Bikini World and Catalina Caper were held up for a number of months, and Ghost in the Invisible Bikini was a box-office failure, leading the end of the beach movie cycle. Kirk's career was losing momentum. Kirk stated: > After I was fired from Disney, I did some of the worst movies ever made and > I got involved with a manager who said it didn't matter what you did as long > as you kept working. He put me in every piece of shit that anybody offered. > I did a series of terrible things, but it was only to get the money. Kirk did not criticize the AIP films, which he described as \"cute, lightweight screwball comedies, but their production values are high. I'm not ashamed of those, but I did some other movies that you wouldn't believe. My manager said just take it, whatever it is, just take it, or they'll forget you.\" Among those were Catalina Caper and It's a Bikini World. Kirk also disliked a comedy he made for Jack H. Harris, The Unkissed Bride (1966), and two films he made for Texan director Larry Buchanan; Mars Needs Women (1968), where he costarred with Yvonne Craig, and It's Alive! (1969). Kirk said: > What I was doing in those pictures, I don't know. The only thing I can say > is that I had a drug problem then, and I didn't know what I was doing, or > what I was getting into. I was an idiot. Buchanan's like a cinematic serial > killer, and he's got to be stopped before he kills again ... But I'd also > like to add that personally, Larry Buchanan was one of the nicest, most > gracious men I ever worked for. He paid me well, he was generous, and he was > decent.\" Buchanan later said: > Tommy was a really fine actor, but he just disappeared into the woodwork. He > had a lot of emotional problems, and needed to talk things out. And the > problem of being the director and an Aquarius, I didn't get much sleep > having to listen to those stories. After putting in a 10-hour day, he'd want > to go and have a few beers until two in the morning. We'd talk about Europe, > traveling, philosophy, what he wanted to do with his life. He is a very > cultured person, and a very proud person, so he probably took as much as he > could before dropping out.\" In October 1966, Kirk was in a car-racing film, Track of Thunder (1967), but his personal problems were beginning to affect his career: > I was drinking, taking pills, and smoking grass. In fact, I was pretty wild. > I came into a whole lot of money, but I threw a lot of parties and spent it > all. I wound up completely broke. I had no self-discipline and I almost died > of a drug overdose a couple of times. It's a miracle that I'm still around. > All of that didn't help the situation. Nobody would touch me; I was > considered box-office poison. Kirk said by the time of Track of Thunder he was so into drugs, \"I was about half awake in that film. I just sort of walked through it and took the money.\" Kirk said he reached bottom in 1970 when he did two movies that were not Screen Actors Guild, Ride the Hot Wind and Blood of Ghastly Horror, causing him to almost lose his SAG card. \"Finally, I said, to hell with the whole thing, to hell with show business, I'm gonna make a new life for myself, and I got off drugs, completely kicked all that stuff.\" Kirk publicly came out as gay in a 1973 interview with Marvin Jones. At the time he was studying acting at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute, while working as a busboy in a Los Angeles restaurant. He was in \"Deadline\", a 1973 episode of The Streets of San Francisco (1973) and a feature, the low-budget western My Name Is Legend (1975). ==Post-acting career== Kirk got over his drug addiction and gave up acting in the mid-1970s. He worked as a waiter and a chauffeur before going into the carpet-cleaning business in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, an operation which he ran for 20 years. In 1990, Kirk said he was \"poor\", adding: > I made a lot of money and I spent it all. No bitterness. No regrets. I did > what I did ... I wasn't the boy next door anymore. I could pretend to be for > a few hours a day in front of the camera. But I couldn't live it. I'm human. > I'm not Francis of Assisi. In 1990, he was working on a script about Abraham Lincoln, but it was not made. He continued to act occasionally, including in the R-rated spoof Attack of the 60 Foot Centerfold. As of 2006, Kirk had more than 30 feature-film roles to his credit. He also enjoyed writing and occasionally appearing at retro film conventions. > I don't blame anybody but myself and my drug abuse for my career going > haywire. I'm not ashamed of being gay, never have been, and never will be. > For that I make no apologies. I have no animosity toward anybody because the > truth is, I wrecked my own career. In 2006, he was retired with \"a nice pension\" and living in Redding, California. He reflected: > As I look back on the whole thing, it gave me the chance to be in three or > four movies that people will enjoy long after I'm gone. I heard Pat Boone > say in an interview that the bombs are just as important as the hits, > because they are all part of life. I'm not bitter. I'm not unhappy things > didn't go the way I wanted them to go with my career. I tried to be a good > actor and an ethical person. I'm still trying to be an ethical and honest > person. But I'm glad to be retired. I live in the middle of a national park, > basically, with miles and miles of wilderness. Redding ain't glamorous. > Monte Carlo it is not. It's small-town life, and it suits me. ==Disney legend== Kirk was inducted as a Disney Legend on October 9, 2006, alongside his former co-stars Tim Considine and Kevin Corcoran. His other repeat co-stars, Annette Funicello and Fred MacMurray, had already been inducted in 1992 and 1987, respectively. Also in 2006, the first of Kirk's Hardy Boys serials was issued on DVD in the fifth \"wave\" of the Walt Disney Treasures series. ==Death== Kirk died at his Las Vegas, Nevada home on September 28, 2021, at the age of 79. ==Filmography== ;Features *The Peacemaker (1956) — Tommy (uncredited) *Old Yeller (1957) — Travis Coates *The Snow Queen (1957) — Kay (voice in 1959 English dubbed version) *The Shaggy Dog (1959) — Wilby Daniels *Swiss Family Robinson (1960) — Ernst *The Absent- Minded Professor (1961) — Biff Hawk *Babes in Toyland (1961) — Grumio *The Horsemasters (1961, TV Series) — Danny Grant *Moon Pilot (1962) — Walter Talbot *Escapade in Florence (1962, TV Series) — Tommy Carpenter *Bon Voyage!
