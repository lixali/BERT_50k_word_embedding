 "text": "In mathematics, a homogeneous binary relation R on a set X is reflexive if it relates every element of X to itself.Levy 1979:74Relational Mathematics, 2010 An example of a reflexive relation is the relation \"is equal to\" on the set of real numbers, since every real number is equal to itself. A reflexive relation is said to have the reflexive property or is said to possess reflexivity. Along with symmetry and transitivity, reflexivity is one of three properties defining equivalence relations. == Definitions == Let R be a binary relation on a set X, which by definition is just a subset of X \\times X. For any x, y \\in X, the notation x R y means that (x, y) \\in R while \"not x R y\" means that (x, y) ot\\in R. The relation R is called if x R x for every x \\in X or equivalently, if \\operatorname{I}_X \\subseteq R where \\operatorname{I}_X := \\\\{ (x, x) ~:~ x \\in X \\\\} denotes the identity relation on X. The of R is the union R \\cup \\operatorname{I}_X, which can equivalently be defined as the smallest (with respect to \\,\\subseteq) reflexive relation on X that is a superset of R. A relation R is reflexive if and only if it is equal to its reflexive closure. The or of R is the smallest (with respect to \\,\\subseteq) relation on X that has the same reflexive closure as R. It is equal to R \\setminus \\operatorname{I}_X = \\\\{ (x, y) \\in R ~:~ x eq y \\\\}. The irreflexive kernel of R can, in a sense, be seen as a construction that is the \"opposite\" of the reflexive closure of R. For example, the reflexive closure of the canonical strict inequality \\,<\\, on the reals \\mathbb{R} is the usual non-strict inequality \\,\\leq\\, whereas the reflexive reduction of \\,\\leq\\, is \\,<. === Related definitions === There are several definitions related to the reflexive property. The relation R is called: ;, or This term is due to C S Peirce, see (Online corrected edition, Feb 2010). Here: p. 32. Russel also introduces two equivalent terms to be contained in or imply diversity.: If it does not relate any element to itself; that is, if not x R x for every x \\in X. A relation is irreflexive if and only if its complement in X \\times X is reflexive. An asymmetric relation is necessarily irreflexive. A transitive and irreflexive relation is necessarily asymmetric. ;: If whenever x, y \\in X are such that x R y, then necessarily x R x.The Encyclopedia Britannica calls this property quasi-reflexivity. ;: If whenever x, y \\in X are such that x R y, then necessarily y R y. ;: If every element that is related to some element is also related to itself. Explicitly, this means that whenever x, y \\in X are such that x R y, then necessarily x R x y R y. Equivalently, a binary relation is quasi-reflexive if and only if it is both left quasi-reflexive and right quasi-reflexive. A relation R is quasi-reflexive if and only if its symmetric closure R \\cup R^{\\operatorname{T}} is left (or right) quasi-reflexive. ;Antisymmetric: If whenever x, y \\in X are such that x R y \\text{ and } y R x, then necessarily x = y. ;: If whenever x, y \\in X are such that x R y, then necessarily x = y.Fonseca de Oliveira, J. N., & Pereira Cunha Rodrigues, C. D. J. (2004). Transposing Relations: From Maybe Functions to Hash Tables. In Mathematics of Program Construction (p. 337). A relation R is coreflexive if and only if its symmetric closure is anti-symmetric. A reflexive relation on a nonempty set X can neither be irreflexive, nor asymmetric (R is called if x R y implies not y R x), nor antitransitive (R is if x R y \\text{ and } y R z implies not x R z). == Examples == Examples of reflexive relations include: * \"is equal to\" (equality) * \"is a subset of\" (set inclusion) * \"divides\" (divisibility) * \"is greater than or equal to\" * \"is less than or equal to\" Examples of irreflexive relations include: * \"is not equal to\" * \"is coprime to\" (for the integers > 1, since 1 is coprime to itself) * \"is a proper subset of\" * \"is greater than\" * \"is less than\" An example of an irreflexive relation, which means that it does not relate any element to itself, is the \"greater than\" relation (x > y) on the real numbers. Not every relation which is not reflexive is irreflexive; it is possible to define relations where some elements are related to themselves but others are not (that is, neither all nor none are). For example, the binary relation \"the product of x and y is even\" is reflexive on the set of even numbers, irreflexive on the set of odd numbers, and neither reflexive nor irreflexive on the set of natural numbers. An example of a quasi-reflexive relation R is \"has the same limit as\" on the set of sequences of real numbers: not every sequence has a limit, and thus the relation is not reflexive, but if a sequence has the same limit as some sequence, then it has the same limit as itself. An example of a left quasi- reflexive relation is a left Euclidean relation, which is always left quasi- reflexive but not necessarily right quasi-reflexive, and thus not necessarily quasi-reflexive. An example of a coreflexive relation is the relation on integers in which each odd number is related to itself and there are no other relations. The equality relation is the only example of a both reflexive and coreflexive relation, and any coreflexive relation is a subset of the identity relation. The union of a coreflexive relation and a transitive relation on the same set is always transitive. == Number of reflexive relations == The number of reflexive relations on an n-element set is 2^{n^2-n}.On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences A053763 == Philosophical logic == Authors in philosophical logic often use different terminology. Reflexive relations in the mathematical sense are called totally reflexive in philosophical logic, and quasi-reflexive relations are called reflexive.
