Founded in 1889, it is the second-oldest campus in the Connecticut State University System and third-oldest public university in the state. Eastern is located on Windham Street in Willimantic, Connecticut, on 30 minutes from Hartford, lying midway between New York City and Boston. Although the majority of courses are held on the main campus, select classes take place at Manchester Community College, Capital Community College, and a satellite center in Groton. Eastern Connecticut State University is a member of the Connecticut State Colleges & Universities. ==History== The Connecticut General Assembly established the Willimantic State Normal School in 1889. As a normal school, the institution trained schoolteachers. The first class was of thirteen female students, who attended classes on the third floor of the Willimantic Savings Institute.Dick Curland, Historically Speaking: Eastern began as 'normal school' to prepare teachers, Norwich Bulletin (November 26, 2017). The first male student entered in 1893. In 1890, the Town of Windham deeded to the State of Connecticut for construction of a new campus for the school. The larger campus was completed in 1895. The first dormitory, Burr Hall, opened in September 1921. The institution was renamed Willimantic State Teachers College in 1937, after it began granting bachelor's degrees. The original Normal School building was destroyed in a fire and replaced by Shafer Hall, which was dedicated in 1946. The State College created its first graduate program (in education) in 1953. After expanding its programs and campus, it became Eastern Connecticut State College in 1967, and Eastern Connecticut State University in 1983. ==Academics== thumb|250px|ECSU's Science Building|alt= Academically, the university is organized into three schools, the School of Arts and Sciences, the School of Education and Professional Studies, and the School of Continuing Education.

The institute is located at 182 High Street. The current director is William Leahy. In 2012 Eastern had a stationary phosphoric acid fuel cell, known as the PureCell System Model 400, installed on the west side of its Science Building. Eastern will use 100 percent of the energy produced by the fuel cell system to provide a majority of the power required for the Science Building, while maximizing the use of the heat output available. Under a 10-year Energy Services Agreement (ESA) with ClearEdge Power, the installation was made possible by a federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) grant through CEFIA. ==Housing== 87 percent of first-year students, and 60 percent of all full-time undergraduates live in college housing.
