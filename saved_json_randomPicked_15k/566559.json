The losses prompt to Germans to halt daylight raids over the United Kingdom and switch to night bombing.Fredette, Raymond H., The Sky on Fire: The First Battle of Britain 1917–1918, New York: Harvest, 1976, , pp. 107-108. ===September=== * In a second bombing raid against Constantinople, the sole Handley Page O/100 in the Mediterranean is forced down in the Gulf of Xeros by engine failure and its crew taken prisoner by Ottoman forces. * The Commander in Chief of the Grand Fleet, Admiral David Beatty, proposes an aerial torpedo attack by 120 Sopwith Cuckoo torpedo bombers launched from eight converted merchant ships against the German High Seas Fleet at its moorings in Germany. Training for the raid takes place in the Firth of Forth, but the war will end before it can be carried out. * September 3 - The United States Armys 1st Aero Squadron arrives in France. * September 3–4 (overnight) - After the losses suffered in the face of improving British air defences in the August 22 daylight raid against England, the Imperial German Army's air service, the Luftstreitkrafte, decides to experiment with night raids, sending five Gotha bombers to attack Chatham Dockyard in Kent. The raid kills 152, including 130 Royal Navy recruits who die in a direct hit on their barracks in the highest death toll inflicted by a single aerial bomb during World War I. The German bombers find that British night defenses are weak.Cole, Christopher and Cheesman, E. F., The Air Defence of Great Britain 1914–1918, London: Putnam, 1984, , p. 302. * September 4–5 (overnight) - The Germans attempt a second heavier-than-air night raid against the United Kingdom, sending 11 Gotha bombers to raid London. Nine of the planes reach England, but only five reach London. British aircraft fly 18 defensive sorties, but fail to make contact with the German aircraft; the British flights, however, demonstrate the feasibility of using the Sopwith Camel as a night fighter. One Gotha fails to return, probably shot down by antiaircraft guns at Fort Borstal in Rochester.Cole, Christopher and Cheesman, E. F., The Air Defence of Great Britain 1914–1918, London: Putnam, 1984, , p. 323. * September 11 – French ace Capitaine Georges Guynemer goes missing in action while flying a SPAD XIII during combat with German aircraft near Poelkapelle, Belgium. Kurt Wisserman of Jasta 3 is credited with shooting him down, but Guynemers body is never found. Guynemer has 54 kills at the time of his death. * September 15 – Flying a Fokker Dr.I, German ace Oberleutnant Kurt Wolff is shot down and killed in a dogfight with Royal Flying Corps Sopwith Camels north of Wervicq, Belgium. His 33 kills will tie him with Leutnant Otto Koennecke and Leutnant Heinrich Bongartz as the 20th-highest-scoring German ace of World War I. * September 17 – While on convoy escort duty in the Atlantic Ocean, the United States Navy armored cruiser Huntington has her kite balloon blown away in bad weather. For rescuing the balloonist, a shipfitter from her crew is awarded the 3rd Medal of Honor of World War I. * September 22 – A Royal Naval Air Service Curtiss H-12 flying boat piloted by Flight Sub- Lieutenant N. Magor sinks the German submarine UB-32 in the North Sea. It is the only confirmed instance of a British aircraft sinking a German submarine without the assistance of surface ships during World War I.Terraine, John, The U-Boat Wars 1916-1945, New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1989, , p. 77.Anti- Submarine Warfare in World War I John Abbatiello (2006) Routledge \"Introduction\" * September 23 – During an epic 10-minute dogfight against six Royal Flying Corps SE.5s of No. 56 Squadron, the German ace Werner Voss, flying a Fokker Dr.I triplane, is shot down and killed by the British ace Arthur Rhys-Davids north of Frezenberg, Belgium. At the time of his death, Voss has 48 victories and is the second-leading German ace behind Manfred von Richthofen at the time; Voss will be the fourth-highest-scoring German ace of World War I.Franks, Norman, Aircraft Versus Aircraft: The Illustrated Story of Fighter Pilot Combat From 1914 to the Present Day, London: Grub Street, 1998, , p. 61. * September 24–25 (overnight) **Nine German Navy Zeppelins set out to attack the middle and north of England. Only L 35 makes a deep penetration of England, dropping her bombs near Rotherham. Total damage inflicted by the raid is £2,210.Whitehouse, Arch, The Zeppelin Fighters, New York: Ace Books, 1966, no ISBN number, p. 223. **Sixteen German Gotha bombers set out to raid the United Kingdom. Thirteen reach England; five of them reach London, while the other eight bomb Dover and other targets in Kent.Cole, Christopher and Cheesman, E. F., The Air Defence of Great Britain 1914–1918, London: Putnam, 1984, , pp. 325-327. * September 25–26 (overnight) – Fifteen German Gotha bombers set out to bomb London, but only three reach the city. One of the bombers comes down in the North Sea, probably the victim of a British Sopwith 1½ Strutter flown by Douglas Bell and George Williams of the Royal Flying Corps's No. 78 Squadron.Cole, Christopher and Cheesman, E. F., The Air Defence of Great Britain 1914–1918, London: Putnam, 1984, , pp. 332-333. * September 28 – In accordance with an agreement between Italy and the United States for the United States to receive bomber aircraft from Italy and United States Army Air Service cadets to receive flight training from the Royal Italian Army's Military Aviation Corps in exchange for raw materials from the United States, the first 46 American cadets arrive at Foggia, Italy, for training. Another 250 soon join them, and almost 500 American aviators will receive training in Italy – primarily at Foggia – before the war ends in November 1918.Blumberg, Arnold, \"Bombing, Italian Style,\" Aviation History, November 2015, p. 50. * September 28–29 (overnight) - Twenty-seven German bombers – 25 Gothas and two Zeppelin-Staaken R.VI bombers – attempt a raid on England, but most turn back due to bad weather. Those that do reach England drop bombs that injure three people and inflict £129 in damage. Three Gothas are lost, and six others are damaged while landing. It is the first time that the new giant Zeppelin- Staaken Riesenflugzeuge, operated by the German Riesenflugzeug Abteilungen (\"Giant Airplane Detachments\") Rfa 500 and Rfa 501, take part in bombing operations against the United Kingdom; they are the largest bombers ever used in bombing Britain, including those used by Germany and Italy during World War II.Guttman, Robert, \"German Giant,\" Aviation History, September 2014, pp. 14, 15. * September 29–30 (overnight) - Seven Gothas and two Zeppelin-Staaken R.VIs set out to raid England. Their bombs kill 40 people and injure 87. One Gotha is lost. By this time, the population of London is so alarmed by the German night raids that up to 300,000 people seek shelter in London Underground stations at night, while others leave the city to seek overnight accommodation elsewhere or to sleep in open fields in the countryside.Fredette, Raymond H., The Sky on Fire: The First Battle of Britain 1917–1918, New York: Harvest, 1976, , pp. 143-144. * September 30-October 1 (overnight) - Eleven Gotha bombers raid England.Fredette, Raymond H., The Sky on Fire: The First Battle of Britain 1917–1918, New York: Harvest, 1976, , p. 264. ===October=== * At Ochey, France, the British Royal Flying Corps forms its first wing dedicated to long-range bombardment of targets in Germany. It will later become VIII Brigade. * The United States Marine Corps divides its Marine Aeronautical Company into two units, the First Aviation Squadron equipped with land planes and the First Aeronautical Squadron equipped with seaplanes. The latter unit is intended for antisubmarine patrols from the Azores.Butler, Glen, Colonel, USMC. \"That Other Air Service Centennial'\". Naval History, June 2012, p. 56. * October 1 ** The Royal Navy tests an aircraft catapult for the first time, using a compressed-air catapult aboard the catapult trials ship Slinger to launch an unmanned Short 184 with its fuselage fabric removed and engine replaced by ballast.Layman, R.D., Before the Aircraft Carrier: The Development of Aviation Vessels 1849-1922, Annapolis, Maryland: Naval Institute Press, 1989, , p. 78. ** The Royal Navy conducts the first launch of an aircraft from a battleship or battlecruiser, when Royal Naval Air Service Flight Commander Frederick Rutland takes off in a Sopwith Pup fighter from a platform mounted on a 15-inch (381-mm) gun turret of the battlecruiser .Thetford, Owen, British Naval Aircraft Since 1912, Sixth Edition, Annapolis, Maryland: Naval Institute Press, 1991, , p. 14. * October 1–2 (overnight) - Eighteen Gotha bombers of the Imperial German Army's air service, the Luftstreitkräfte, set out to raid the United Kingdom. Eleven of them reach England. British antiaircraft guns fire 14,000 rounds at them without scoring a single hit. The intensity of German air raids over the past week have created a shortage of antiaircraft shells and worn out the barrels of many antiaircraft guns, and falling fragments from antiaircraft shells have killed eight people and injured 67 in England.Fredette, Raymond H., The Sky on Fire: The First Battle of Britain 1917–1918, New York: Harvest, 1976, , pp. 135, 146-147, 264. * October 7 – L 57, a German Navy Zeppelin modified to be able to make a long-distance flight from Yambol, Bulgaria, to Mahenge, German East Africa, to deliver medical supplies and munitions to German ground forces there, and as such the largest airship ever built at the time at 743 feet (226.5 meters) and carrying 2,418,700 cubic feet (68,490 cubic meters) of hydrogen gas, is wrecked and destroyed by fire while attempting to take off for a test flight in poor weather.Whitehouse, Arch, The Zeppelin Fighters, New York: Ace Books, 1966, no ISBN number, p. 234. * October 19 – The U.S. Army opens Love Field in Dallas, Texas as a flight training base. The airfield is later converted to civil use, becoming the primary commercial airport for the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex until 1974, and continues to serve as an important regional airport. * October 19–20 (overnight) – The German Navy dispatches 13 Zeppelins on a high-altitude raid against the middle of England, and they encounter an unexpected gale. Two never leave their sheds; the other 11 set out for England and become lost in the storm. Most bomb open countryside, although L 41 damages the Austin Motor Works at Longbridge and L 45 bombs Northampton and London, killing 24 and injuring nine people. The British use muzzled antiaircraft guns around London to avoid guiding Zeppelins to the city, and the attack becomes known as the \"Silent Raid.\" Although 73 British planes take off to intercept the raid, none have the ability to reach the Zeppelins operating altitude. The storm scatters the Zeppelins widely across Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France during their return flights and only six reach Germany safely. L 55 sets an altitude record for airships of 24,000 feet (7,315 meters) during her homebound flight before being damaged beyond repair in a hard landing in Germany; L 44 is shot down in flames by French artillery over the Western Front with the loss of all hands; L 49 lands in France and is captured along with her entire crew; L 45 lands in France and is destroyed by her crew, who are captured; and L 50 makes a hard landing in France, after which 15 of her crew manage to get off the airship and are captured and she drifts away and crosses France before disappearing over the Mediterranean Sea with four men still aboard.Whitehouse, Arch, The Zeppelin Fighters, New York: Ace Books, 1966, no ISBN number, pp. 223-232, 236, 243. * October 29–30 (overnight) - Three German Luftstreitkräfte bombers set out for the first heavier-than-air raid on England in four weeks. Two divert to Calais, France, due to bad weather; the third reaches England and bombs the Essex coast.Fredette, Raymond H., The Sky on Fire: The First Battle of Britain 1917–1918, New York: Harvest, 1976, , pp. 162-166. * October 30 – The German ace Leutnant Heinrich Gontermann is performing aerobatics when the upper wing of his Fokker Dr.I fighter breaks off. He is fatally injured in the subsequent crash. His 39 victories will tie him with Leutnant Carl Menckhoff as the 13th- highest-scoring German ace of World War I. * October 30–31 (overnight) - Twenty-two German Gotha bombers set out to raid London, with the newly developed 4.5-kg (9.9-lb) incendiary bombs included in their bombloads. Fewer than half the bombers reach the London area; they bomb the city's eastern suburbs, but many of the incendiary bombs fail to ignite. The rest of the planes bomb Kent, where they destroy a gasometer in Ramsgate but achieve little else. Five of the bombers crash while attempting to land upon returning to their bases. Bad weather will prevent another raid against England until December. ===November=== * November 19 – The Battle of Caporetto ends. The 27-day battle has caught the Italian Corpo Aeronautico Militare (\"Military Aviation Corps\") by surprise and it has lost a great deal of equipment, but it claims to have shot down 39 enemy aircraft in 70 air-to-air engagements during the battle.Gooch, John, Mussolini and His Generals: The Armed Forces and Fascist Foreign Policy, 1922-1940, Cambridge, U.K: Cambridge University Press, 2007, , p. 53. * November 21–24 – In an attempt to deliver medical supplies and munitions to German ground forces in German East Africa, the German Navy Zeppelin L 59, specially modified for long-range flights, makes a 6,757-kilometer (4,196-statute mile) journey from Yambol, Bulgaria, over European Turkey, Asia Minor, and the Mediterranean Sea and into Africa to a point west of Khartoum before being recalled to Yambol, which she reaches after 95 hours 5 minutes continuously in the air at an average speed of 71 km/h (44 mph). The flight sets a new aircraft endurance record. She returns to Yambol with enough fuel aboard to have remained in the air for another 64 hours.Whitehouse, Arch, The Zeppelin Fighters, New York: Ace Books, 1966, no ISBN number, pp. 234-235. * November 28 – The United States Navy′s Naval Aircraft Factory is completed at League Island Navy Yard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 110 days after groundbreaking. ===December=== * The Imperial German Army's air service, the Luftstreitkräfte, begins to operate a radio- equipped Rumpler C.IV off the coast of England to report weather conditions and reduce the chance of adverse weather interfering with Luftstreitkräfte bomber raids against the United Kingdom.Fredette, Raymond H., The Sky on Fire: The First Battle of Britain 1917–1918, New York: Harvest, 1976, , p. 166. * Imperial German Navy Zeppelins make daily reconnaissance patrols over the Heligoland Bight throughout the month.Whitehouse, Arch, The Zeppelin Fighters, New York: Ace Books, 1966, no ISBN number, p. 237. * December 5–6 (overnight) - After weeks of unfavorable weather, the Luftstreitkräfte makes its first heavier-than-air raid against the United Kingdom since October 1917. Nineteen Gotha and two Riesenflugzeug bombers attack in several waves, causing £100,000 in damage, mostly in London, but inflicting few casualties. British antiaircraft guns shoot down two Gothas and their crews are captured; a third bomber and its crew go missing.Cole, Christopher and Cheesman, E. F., The Air Defence of Great Britain 1914–1918, London: Putnam, 1984, , pp. 355-357.
