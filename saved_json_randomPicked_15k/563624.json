 "text": "The Southern League is a men's football competition featuring semi- professional clubs from the South and Midlands of England. Together with the Isthmian League and the Northern Premier League it forms levels seven and eight of the English football league system. The structure of the Southern League has changed several times since its formation in 1894, and currently there are 82 clubs which are divided into four divisions. The Central and South Divisions are at step 3 of the National League System (NLS), and are feeder divisions, mainly to the National League South but also to the National League North. Feeding the Premier Divisions are two regional divisions, Division One Central and Division One South, which are at step 4 of the NLS. These divisions are in turn fed by various regional leagues. The league has its administrative head office at Eastgate House in the City of Gloucester. ==History== ===Football in the south of England=== Professional football (and, indeed, professional sports in general) developed more slowly in Southern England than in Northern England. Professionalism was first sanctioned by The Football Association as early as 1885, but when The Football League was founded in 1888 its member clubs were based entirely in the North and Midlands, as the county football associations in the South were firmly opposed to professionalism. Woolwich Arsenal (nowadays simply Arsenal) were the first club in London to turn professional in 1891 and were one of the prime motivators behind an attempt to set up a Southern League to mirror the existing Northern and Midlands based Football League. However, this venture failed in the face of opposition from the London Football Association, and Woolwich Arsenal instead joined the Football League as its only representative south of Birmingham in 1893. Additionally, an amateur league, the Southern Alliance was founded in 1892, with seven clubs from the region, but that folded after one incomplete season. ===Formation of the Southern League=== Nonetheless, another attempt was made to form the Southern League, and this time it was successful. A competition for both professional and amateur clubs was founded in 1894 under the initiative of Millwall Athletic (now simply Millwall). Initially only one division was envisaged, but such was the enthusiasm for the idea, that eventually two divisions were formed. The sixteen original founder members were: {| border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0> | valign=\"top\" width=50%| {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Division One |- |Chatham |- |Clapton |- |Ilford |- |Luton Town |- |Millwall Athletic |- |Reading |- |Royal Ordnance Factories |- |2nd Scots Guards |- |Swindon Town |} | valign=\"top\" width=50%| {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Division Two |- |Bromley |- |Chesham |- |Maidenhead |- |New Brompton |- |Old St Stephen's |- |Sheppey United |- |Uxbridge |} |} 2nd Scots Guards withdrew before the first season started and were replaced by Southampton St Mary's. Woolwich Arsenal attempted to add their reserve side to the second division but this application was refused due to the club's existing membership of The Football League. ===Success of the Southern League=== The Southern League soon became the dominant competition below The Football League in Southern and Central England, and by the turn of the century a few of the Southern League sides began to seriously rival the Football League in the FA Cup.Football League Football Club History Database A preview of the 1900–01 season in the Daily News described the league as \"now, without a doubt, second only in importance and the strength of its clubs to the Football League itself. With the exception of Woolwich Arsenal, who prefer to remain members of the Second Division of the Football League, all the best professional teams in the South are now enrolled in the ranks of the Southern League\". Two Southern League clubs, Southampton (in 1900 and 1902) and Tottenham Hotspur (in 1901) reached the final of the FA Cup around the turn of the twentieth century. Tottenham Hotspur remain the only club from outside the Football League (and since its inception, also the Premier League) to have won the FA Cup. Several of the best players in England moved from the Football League to the Southern League around this time, due to the restrictions on their freedom of movement and wages implemented by the Football League between 1893 and 1901, and the failed efforts of the Association Footballers' Union (the AFU) to relax the restrictions. This ended in 1910 when the League came to a reciprocal agreement with the Football League. The champions of the two leagues during this period met in the annual Charity Shield. Out of the six meetings the respective league champions had in the Shield, however, only one was won by the Southern League champions – Brighton & Hove Albion, in 1910, and this remains their only top level national honour. Up until World War I, the league also organised several representative 'inter-league' matches, against the Football League XIFootball League v Southern League, Before The 'D'...Association Football around the world, 1863-1937, 27 November 2017 and the Scottish Football League XI. They won the inaugural inter-league equivalent of the British Home Championship in 1910, defeating the Football League 3–2, Scottish League 1–0 and the Irish League 4–0. In 1907, it accepted newly converted to Association and future Football League club Bradford, a northern club, as a member, reflecting its senior position at the time. Stalybridge Celtic and Stoke also joined before the First World War. In 1920, virtually the entire top division of the Southern League was absorbed by the Football League to become that league's new Third Division. A year later the Third Division was expanded and regionalised. The Third Division clubs from the previous season became the Third Division South, with the addition of the Third Division North. Of the original founder members, six – Gillingham (formerly New Brompton), Luton Town, Millwall, Reading, Southampton and Swindon Town – went on to be Football League clubs. ===A feeder league=== For the next six decades, the Football League and Southern League would occasionally exchange a limited number of clubs as a result of the older league's re-election process. From 1920 onward, the Southern League's status as a semi-professional league was firmly established. In 1977, Wimbledon became the last Southern League club to successfully achieve election into the Football League. With its clubs seeking a more regular means of advancing to the Football League, in 1979 the Southern League became a feeder to the new Alliance Premier League along with the Isthmian League and the Northern Premier League, and the top Southern clubs of the day joined the new league. In turn, the APL (renamed Football Conference in 1986 and National League in 2015) would eventually succeed in becoming a feeder to the Football League. The league lost more of its top clubs in 2004 when the Conference added two regional divisions below the existing National League, the Conference South and Conference North. In May 2017, the FA chose the Southern League to add an additional division at step 3 as part of another restructuring in the NLS; the two Premier Divisions were set at 22 clubs each. The new Central Division started playing in the 2018–19 season. ===Sponsorship=== The first sponsor of the Southern League was Beazer Homes who sponsored the league from 1987 to 1996. The sponsors after Beazer Homes to the present day are: Dr Martens (1996–2004), British Gas (2006–2009), Zamaretto (2009–2011), Evo-Stik (2011–2013),League tables available English Non-League Archive 1965–98 Calor Gas (2013–2014), Evo-Stik (2014–2019) and BetVictor (2019–2020). From the 2020–21 season the league has been sponsored by Pitching In. Entain's grassroots sports investment programme. At the time of announcement, Entain went by its former name GVC Holdings. Under this partnership, the Southern League is marketed as one of the three Trident Leagues, alongside its Isthmian and Northern Premier counterparts. ==Current members== ===Premier Central=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Club !Home ground |- |AFC Rushden & Diamonds |Hayden Road |- |Alvechurch |Lye Meadow |- |Banbury United |Spencer Stadium |- |Barwell |Kirkby Road |- |Biggleswade Town |Langford Road |- |Bromsgrove Sporting |Victoria Ground |- |Coalville Town |Owen Street Sports Ground |- |Hednesford Town |Keys Park |- |Hitchin Town |Top Field |- |Leiston |Victory Road |- |Lowestoft Town |Crown Meadow |- |Needham Market |Bloomfields |- |Nuneaton Borough |Liberty Way |- |Peterborough Sports |Lincoln Road |- |Redditch United |Valley Stadium |- |Royston Town |Garden Walk |- |Rushall Olympic |Dales Lane |- |St Ives Town |Westwood Road |- |Stourbridge |War Memorial Athletic Ground |- |Stratford Town |Knights Lane |- |Tamworth |The Lamb Ground |} ===Premier South=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Club !Home ground |- |Beaconsfield Town |Holloways Park |- |Chesham United |The Meadow |- |Dorchester Town |The Avenue Stadium |- |Farnborough |Cherrywood Road |- |Gosport Borough |Privett Park |- |Harrow Borough |Earlsmead Stadium |- |Hartley Wintney |The Memorial Playing Fields |- |Hayes & Yeading United |Beaconsfield Road |- |Hendon |Silver Jubilee Park |- |Kings Langley |Gaywood Park |- |Merthyr Town |Penydarren Park |- |Metropolitan Police |Imber Court |- |Poole Town |Tatnam Ground |- |Salisbury |The Raymond McEnhill Stadium |- |Swindon Supermarine |Hunts Copse |- |Taunton Town |Wordsworth Drive |- |Tiverton Town |Ladysmead |- |Truro City |Bolitho Park (groundshare with Plymouth Parkway) |- |Walton Casuals |Elmbridge Sports Hub |- |Weston-super- Mare |Woodspring Stadium |- |Wimborne Town |The Cuthbury |- |Yate Town |Lodge Road |} ===Division One Central=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Club !Home ground |- |AFC Dunstable |Creasey Park |- |Aylesbury United |The Meadow |- |Barton Rovers |Sharpenhoe Road |- |Bedford Town |The Eyrie |- |Berkhamsted |Broadwater |- |Biggleswade |Langford Road |- |Colney Heath |Recreation Ground |- |Didcot Town |Loop Meadow |- |F.C.

times over the years and currently consists of Central and South Divisions at step 3 of the Pyramid with Division One South and Division One Central at step 4. Due in large part to the presence of the Isthmian League, the geographical footprint of the Southern League actually extends further north than the National League South. Therefore, while the winners of the Central and South Divisions are promoted to the National League South, those clubs in the most northerly locales are promoted to the National League North. In the past, the majority of the winners of the former Premier Division, together with the winners of a playoff, were promoted to the higher league. Clubs relegated from the Southern League can theoretically be placed in any of fourteen lower-level leagues, but in practice it is likely to be one of the following (based on geography): *Combined Counties League *Hellenic League *Midland Football League *Spartan South Midlands League *United Counties League *Wessex League *Western League From time to time, clubs outside the promotion and relegation positions based at the geographical edges of the Southern League will be compelled to leave the League by the NLS Committee, should it be necessary for them to compete in the Northern Premier or Isthmian Leagues so as to correct any imbalances brought on by the geographical distribution of the clubs promoted and relegated to this level. Clubs in the Northern Premier or Isthmian Leagues have also been entered into the Southern League for the same reason. In general, there has been a drift southwards, with clubs in the Midlands such as Halesowen Town moving into the Northern Premier League. ==See also== *Isthmian League *Northern Premier League ==References== ==External links== *Official website 7 Category:Sports leagues established in 1894 Category:1894 establishments in England Category:Southern England Eng",
