 "text": "The Radical Party of Chile (), is a social-democratic political party in Chile. The party was founded as the Social Democrat Radical Party (Partido Radical Socialdemócrata) on 18 August 1994 out of a union between the Radical Party and the Social Democracy Party, both of which had received poor results in the parliamentary elections. The unified party adopted its current name in 2018. The party supported Ricardo Lagos in the 1999–2000 presidential elections, who won 48.0% in the first round and was elected with 51.3% in the second round. At the 2001 legislative elections, the party won as part of the Concertación six out of 120 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and no seats in the Senate. This changed at the 2005 legislative elections to seven and one, respectively. In 2009, it won five congress seats and one senate seat. The party is a member of Socialist International and participant in the Permanent Conference of Political Parties of Latin America and the Caribbean. == Executive board == The current party executive assumed in August 2018. {|class=wikitable !Position !!
