The current minister of natural resources is Jonathan Wilkinson, since October 26, 2021.

With the transfer of the Canadian Forest Service from the Department of Forestry to the Department of Agriculture, the forestry portfolio came under the minister of agriculture between 1984 to 1985, then back to the minister of the environment from 1985. It became a single department in 1989 and then designated to the minister of energy, mines and resources in 1990. In 1994, the Department of Natural Resources Act, S.C. 1994, c. 41, provided for the creation of the minister of natural resources, with authority to carry out matters previously undertaken by the minister of forestry and the minister of energy, mines and resources. === Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources === The minister of energy, mines, and resources () was a member of the Cabinet from 1966 to 1995. Prior to 1966, the responsibility related to Canadian mines and natural resources resided in various ministers: * Minister of the Interior (1873–1936) * Minister of Mines (1907–36) * Minister of Mines and Resources (1936–50) * Minister of Resources and Development (1950–53) * Minister of Mines and Technical Surveys (1950–66) * Minister of Northern Affairs and National Resources (1953–62) The emerging role of energy development in federal policy would become more prominent in 1966, when that responsibility was adopted by the natural resources portfolio,\"Department of Natural Resources.\" The Canadian Encyclopedia. 2006 February 7. whereupon the minister of mines and technical surveys was abolished and the minister of energy, mines and resources was established in its place by Statute 14-15 Eliz. II, c. 25—which received royal assent on 16 June 1966 and proclaimed in-force on October 1 later that year. Three decades later, in 1995, the energy, mines and resources portfolio merged with that of forestry to form the current minister of natural resources, under the Department of Natural Resources Act, S.C. 1994, c. 41—which received royal assent on December 15, 1994. === Minister of Forestry === The minister of forestry was an office in the Cabinet from 1962 to 1966 and again from 1990 to 1995. Between 1966 to 1990, it was known as the minister of forestry and rural development. Prior to 1962, the responsibility for forestry resided in various ministers: * Minister of the Interior (1873–1936) * Minister of Mines and Resources (1936–50) * Minister of Resources and Development (1950–53) * Minister of Northern Affairs and National Resources (1953–62) The position of minister of forestry was first created in 1962 by Prime Minister John Diefenbaker and lasted into the government of Lester B. Pearson. In 1971, responsibility for forestry along with fisheries merged into the minister of the environment, briefly renamed as minister of fisheries and the environment from 1976–79, minister of state (environment) from 1977–79, then back to the minister of the environment from 1979–84.
