 "text": "At the 1904 Summer Olympics, a water polo tournament was contested. Only American contestants participated, three club teams of 7 players each entered. A German team tried to enter, but its entry was refused because the players did not play for the same club. The event took place in a pond in Forest Park, the location of both the Olympics and the World's Fair. Previously the IOC and International Swimming Federation (FINA) considered water polo event as part of unofficial program in 1904. However in July 2021 after accepting the recommendation of Olympic historian Bill Mallon, IOC recognized water polo event along with several others as an official event of the 1904 Olympic program. ==Medal summary== {| |-valign=top | New York Athletic Club David Bratton George Van Cleaf Leo Goodwin Louis Handley David Hesser Joe Ruddy James Steen | Chicago Athletic Association Rex Beach Jerome Steever Edwin Swatek Charles Healy Frank Kehoe David Hammond Bill Tuttle | Missouri Athletic Club John Meyers Manfred Toeppen Gwynne Evans Amedee Reyburn Frank Schreiner Augustus Goessling Bill Orthwein |} ==References== ==Sources== * PDF documents in the LA84 Foundation Digital Library: ** Official Report of the 1904 Olympic Games (download, archive) * Water polo on the Olympedia website ** Water polo at the 1904 Summer Olympics (men's tournament) * Water polo on the Sports Reference website ** Water polo at the 1904 Summer Games (men's tournament) (archived) Category:1904 Summer Olympics events 1904 Summer Olympics Category:1904 in water polo 1904",
