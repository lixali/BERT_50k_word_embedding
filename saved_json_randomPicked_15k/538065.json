 "text": "The NCAA Division III Women's Basketball Championship is the annual tournament to determine the national champions of women's NCAA Division III collegiate basketball in the United States. It was held annually from 1982, when the NCAA began to sponsor women's sports at all three levels, through 2019. No championship was held in 2020 or 2021 due to COVID-19 issues. Washington–St. Louis is the most successful program with five national titles. The most recent champion is Hope College. ==History== === 1982 Final Four === Held in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, the 1982 Women's Final Four Basketball Tournament was the first sponsored by the NCAA. Featuring host Elizabethtown College, Clark College (Massachusetts), Pomona College (California) and the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, the tournament was played in a classic field house over a three-day period. In the first game of the National Semi-Final Elizabethtown took control right from the tip-off against Clark and easily cruised to a 71–51 victory. In the second game of the Final Four Pomona took the lead early in the game, but UNC Greensboro battled back to tie the game at 56 with six minutes to play. UNC Greensboro then went on a run and pulled away for a 77–66 win. Elizabethtown and UNC Greensboro turned the championship game into an epic battle of lead changes and shifts in momentum. Last second heroics by UNC Greensboro sent the game into overtime, but Elizabethtown came up with the final stop in overtime to win 67–66 in overtime. Television coverage was provided by a fledgling ESPN while exclusive radio coverage was provided by KSPC Radio - Pomona College's tiny KSPC sports broadcasting group with Geoff Willis (Pomona '83) and James Timmerman (Pomona '82) providing the play by play and color. ESPN was so embryonic that the game was broadcast multiple times during the following two weeks and ESPN hired the KSPC Radio staff to help with background and color research about the players and the teams. ==Results== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; text-align: center;\" |- !colspan=11|NCAA Division III Women's Basketball Championship |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |Year ! rowspan=\"2\" |Finals Site ! rowspan=\"2\" |Arena ! colspan=3|Championship ! rowspan=\"2\" |Semifinalists |- !Champion !Score !Runner-up |- |1982 Details | Elizabethtown, PA | Thompson Gymnasium | Elizabethtown | 67–66 (OT) | UNC Greensboro | Pomona-Pitzer, Clark |- |1983 Details | Worcester, MA | Kneller Athletics Center | North Central (IL) | 83–71 | Elizabethtown | Knoxville, Clark |- |1984 Details | Scranton, PA | John Long Center | Rust | 51–49 | Elizabethtown | Salem St, North Central |- |1985 Details | De Pere, WI | Schuldes Sports Center | Scranton | 68–59 | New Rochelle | Millikin, St. Norbert |- |1986 Details | Salem, MA | Twohig Gymnasium | Salem State | 89–85 | Bishop (TX) | Capital, Rust |- |1987 Details | Scranton, PA | John Long Center | UW–Stevens Point | 81–74 | Concordia–Moorhead | Scranton, Kean |- |1988 Details | Moorhead, MN | Memorial Auditorium | Concordia–Moorhead | 65–57 | St. John Fisher | UNC-Greensboro, Southern Maine |- |1989 Details | Danville, KY | Alumni Gymnasium | Elizabethtown | 66–65 | Cal State Stanislaus | Centre, Clarkson |- |1990 Details | Holland, MI | Holland Civic Center | Hope | 65–63 | St. John Fisher | Heidelberg, Centre |- |1991 Details | St. Paul, MN | Schoenecker Arena | St. Thomas (MN) | 73–55 | Muskingum | Eastern Connecticut, Washington (MO) |- |1992 Details | Bethlehem, PA | Johnston Hall | Alma | 79–75 | Moravian | Luther, Eastern Connecticut St |- |1993 Details | Pella, IA | Kuyper Gymnasium | Central (IA) | 71–63 | Capital | Scranton, St. Benedict |- |1994 Details | Eau Claire, WI | W.L.
