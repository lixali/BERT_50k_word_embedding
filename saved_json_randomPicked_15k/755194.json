It is a philosophy that places total responsibility for the physical environment of the school on the students. Students are not only responsible for cleaning and maintaining the campus, but also for the program's organization and management. As students in the Lower School progress through the grades, they assume more responsibility for their classrooms and the Lower School building. Students in the Middle and Upper Schools (grades 6 - 12) are in charge at all times of the upkeep of the whole school. This is called the Jobs Program. In the middle school there's an 8th grade job captain assigned to your space whether its a classroom, terrace or in the kitchen cleaning plates the student community pitches in. In the high school, you have a Senior job captain assigned to your area with senior grounds over seeing the collective upper campus whether cleaning the gyms, classrooms or lockerrooms, the students are given a form of responsibility outside normal schoolwork to better their community. ==Senior Independent Studies (SIS)== In years past, in addition to self-help and volunteering, Upper School students had to have met the requirement of 100 hours of community service outside the Wooster community, which had to be completed between the summer before freshman year and graduation. Seniors are required to participate in the Senior Independent Study (SIS) program the last six weeks of their senior year, at which time they may pursue a community service project or career interest that is approved by a group of faculty members Upon completion of SIS, each student submits a written report and makes an oral presentation to the faculty and senior classmates about what he, she or they learned. ==References== ==External links== *Wooster School -- official site *John D.
