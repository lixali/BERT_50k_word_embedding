 "text": "The hour record is the record for the longest distance cycled in one hour on a bicycle from a stationary start. Cyclists attempt this record alone on the track without other competitors present. It is considered one of the most prestigious records in cycling. Since it was first set, cyclists ranging from unknown amateurs to well-known professionals have held the record, adding to its prestige and allure. There is now one unified record for upright bicycles meeting the requirements of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI). Hour- record attempts for UCI bikes are made in a velodrome. == Early hour records (until 1972) == The first universally accepted record was in 1876 when the American Frank Dodds rode on a penny-farthing. The first recorded distance was set in 1873 by James Moore in Wolverhampton, riding an Ariel 49\" high wheel () bicycle; however, the distance was recorded at exactly , leading to the theory that the distance was just approximated and not accurately measured. The first officially recognised record was set by Henri Desgrange at the Buffalo Velodrome, Paris in 1893 following the formation of the International Cycling Association, the forerunner of the modern-day UCI. Throughout the run up to the First World War, the record was broken on five occasions by Frenchmen Oscar Egg and Marcel Berthet, and due to the attempts being highly popular and guaranteeing rich attendances, it is said that each ensured he did not beat the record by too much of a margin, enabling further lucrative attempts by the other. The hour was attempted sporadically over the following 70 years, with most early attempts taking place at the Buffalo Velodrome in Paris, before the Velodromo Vigorelli in Milan became popular in 1930s and 1940s sparking attempts from leading Italian riders and former Giro d'Italia winners such as Fausto Coppi and Ercole Baldini. Coppi's record set in 1942, during the Second World War, despite Milan being bombed nightly by Allied forces, was eventually broken in 1956 by Jacques Anquetil on his third attempt. In 1967, 11 years later, Anquetil again broke the hour record, with , but the record was disallowed because he refused to take the newly introduced post-race doping test.Cycling 26 November 1987 He had objected to what he saw as the indignity of having to urinate in a tent in front of a crowded velodrome and said he would take the test later at his hotel. The international judge ruled against the idea, and a scuffle ensued that involved Anquetil's manager, Raphaël Géminiani. In 1968, Ole Ritter broke the record in Mexico City, the first attempt at altitude since Willie Hamilton in 1898. The women's hour record was first established in 1893 by Mlle de Saint-Sauveur at the Vélodrome Buffalo in Paris, setting a total distance of . Circus rider Mlle (Madamemoiselle) de Saint-Sauveur may have been a stage name of light opera singer Antoinette Marie Edmonde de Rafélis de Saint-Sauveur. The record was improved several times over the next years, until Louise Roger reached in 1897 also at Vélodrome Buffalo.Revolutionary Times – The Birth of the Women’s Hour Record - SB Nation's Podium Café, Feargal McKay, 11 September 2018 In 1911 the longest standing men's or women's record (37 years) was set by the 157 cm (5 ft 2 in) tall Alfonsina Strada: riding a 20 kg (44 lbs) machine. From 1947 to 1952, Élyane Bonneau and Jeannine Lemaire set several new hour records, the last of which was by Lemaire in 1952. The first women's hour record approved by the UCI was by Tamara Novikova in 1955. However Lemaire's 1952 non-UCI record was not bettered until Elsy Jacobs' broke the 40 kmh barrier in 1958, the year Jacobs had won the inaugural women's road world championship. Jacobs' 1958 41.347 km UCI record would not be bettered until 1972. === Historical hour records === {| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"min-width:22em\" |+ Men's historical hour records (1873–1972) (UCI official records from 1893) |- !Date !Rider !Location !

The record would stand for 12 years until in January 1984, Francesco Moser set a new record at . This was the first noted use of disc wheels, which provided an aerodynamic gain as well as Moser wearing a skin suit. Moser's record would eventually be moved in 1997 to \"best human effort\" === 1990s: non-traditional riding positions === In 1993 and 1994, Graeme Obree, who built his own bikes, posted two records with his hands tucked under his chest. In 1994, Moser set the veteran's record at in Mexico City. Moser beat his 1984 record, using bullhorn handlebars, steel airfoil tubing, disk wheels and skinsuit. It was also faster than Obree's first record in 1993. Following the outlawing of the \"praying mantis\" style by the UCI in May 1994, Spaniard Miguel Indurain and Swiss Tony Rominger broke the record using a more traditional tri-bar setup with Rominger setting a distance of 55.291 km. Chris Boardman took up the challenge using a modified version of the Lotus 110 bicycle, a successor to the earlier Lotus 108 bicycle he'd ridden to victory at the 1992 Olympic Games. South African company Aerodyne Technology built the frame. Boardman set the UCI Absolute record of in 1996, using another position pioneered by Obree, his arms out in front in a \"Superman\" position. This too was considered controversial by the UCI, and while the record was allowed to stand, the position was banned making Boardman's record set in 1996 effectively unbeatable using traditional bike position. === 1997 UCI rule change === With the increasing gap between modern bicycles and what was available at the time of Merckx's record, the UCI established two records in 1997: *UCI Hour Record: which restricted competitors to roughly the same equipment as Merckx, banning time trial helmets, disc or tri-spoke wheels, aerodynamic bars and monocoque frames. *Best Human Effort: also known as the UCI \"Absolute\" Record in which modern equipment was permitted. As a result of the 1997 rule change, all records since 1972, including Boardman's in 1996, were moved to Best Human Effort and the distance of Eddy Merckx set in 1972 once more became the official UCI benchmark. In 2000, Boardman attempted the UCI record on a traditional bike, and rode , topping Merckx by , an improvement of 0.02%. In 2005, Ondřej Sosenka improved Boardman's performance at using a 54×13 gear. However, Sosenka failed a doping control in 2001 and then again in 2008, the latter resulting in a career-ending suspension which puts in doubt the validity of his record. All women's records from 1986 to 1996 were recategorized to Best Human Effort. === Hour record holders (men's) === {| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"min- width:22em\" |+UCI hour record (1972–2014) |- !width=120|Date !width=140|Rider !Age !Velodrome !Distance (km) !Equipment |- | 25 October 1972 || Eddy Merckx || 27 || Agustín Melgar (333 meters outdoor concrete high-altitude), Mexico City, Mexico || 49.431 ||Drop handlebar, round steel tubing frame, wire spokes. 5.5 kg Colnago (drilled chain & handlebars) |- | 27 October 2000 || Chris Boardman || 32 || Manchester Velodrome (250 meters indoor wood sea- level), Manchester, UK || 49.441 ||Drop handlebar, carbon fibre tubing frame, wire spokes. |- | 19 July 2005 || Ondřej Sosenka || 29 || Krylatskoye (333 meters indoor wood sea-level), Moscow, Russia || 49.700 ||Drop handlebar, carbon fibre tubing frame, wire spokes. |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable mw- collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"min-width:22em\" |+ UCI best human effort (1984–2014) |- !width=120|Date !width=140|Rider !Age !Velodrome !Distance (km) !Equipment |- | 19 January 1984 || Francesco Moser || 32 || Agustín Melgar (333 meters outdoor concrete high-altitude), Mexico City, Mexico || 50.808 || Bullhorn handlebar, oval steel tubing frame, disc wheels. |- | 23 January 1984 || Francesco Moser || 32 || Agustín Melgar (333 meters outdoor concrete high- altitude), Mexico City, Mexico || 51.151 || Bullhorn handlebar, oval steel tubing frame, disc wheels. |- | 17 July 1993 || Graeme Obree || 27 || Vikingskipet (250 meters indoor wood sea-level), Hamar, Norway || 51.596 || Graeme Obree-style \"praying mantis\" handlebar, round steel tubing frame, carbon tri-spoke wheels. |- | 23 July 1993 || Chris Boardman || 24 || Velodrome du Lac (250 meters indoor wood sea-level), Bordeaux, France || 52.270 || Triathlon handlebar, carbon airfoil tubing frame, carbon 4-spoke wheels. |- | 27 April 1994 || Graeme Obree || 28 || Velodrome du Lac (250 meters indoor wood sea-level), Bordeaux, France || 52.713 ||Graeme Obree-style \"praying mantis\" handlebar, round steel tubing frame, carbon tri-spoke wheels. |- | 2 September 1994 || Miguel Indurain || 30 || Velodrome du Lac (250 meters indoor wood sea-level), Bordeaux, France || 53.040 ||Wide triathlon handlebar, carbon monocoque aero frame, disc wheels. |- | 22 October 1994 || Tony Rominger || 33 || Velodrome du Lac (250 meters indoor wood sea-level), Bordeaux, France || 53.832 ||Triathlon handlebar, oval steel tubing frame, disc wheels. |- | 5 November 1994 || Tony Rominger || 33 || Velodrome du Lac (250 meters indoor wood sea-level), Bordeaux, France || 55.291 ||Triathlon handlebar, oval steel tubing frame, disc wheels. |- | 6 September 1996 || Chris Boardman || 28 || Manchester Velodrome (250 meters indoor wood sea- level), Manchester, UK || 56.375 ||Graeme Obree \"superman-style\" handlebar, carbon monocoque aero frame, 5-spoke front and rear disc wheel. |} === Hour record holders (women's) === {| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw- collapsed\" style=\"min-width:22em\" |+ UCI hour record (1972–2014) |- !width=120|Date !width=140|Rider !Age !Velodrome !Distance (km) !Equipment |- | 25 November 1972 || Maria Cressari || 28 || Agustín Melgar Olympic Velodrome, Mexico City, Mexico || 41.471 || 4.7-kilogram Colnago, drop handlebars, wire spokes. |- | 16 September 1978 || Keetie van Oosten || 29 || Munich, Germany || 43.082 || RIH superlight steel frame, drop handlebars, wire spokes. |- | 18 October 2000 || Anna Wilson-Millward || 26 || Vodafone Arena, Melbourne, Australia || 43.501 ||Perkins, Columbus steel tubing, box section rims, wire spokes |- | 5 November 2000 || Jeannie Longo-Ciprelli || 42 || Agustín Melgar Olympic Velodrome, Mexico City, Mexico || 44.767 ||Drop handlebar, steel tubing frame, wire spokes. |- | 7 December 2000 || Jeannie Longo-Ciprelli || 42 || Agustín Melgar, Mexico City, Mexico|| 45.094 ||Drop handlebar, steel tubing frame, wire spokes. |- | 1 October 2003 || Leontien Zijlaard-van Moorsel || 33 || Agustín Melgar, Mexico City, Mexico || 46.065 ||Drop handlebar, Koga chromoly tubing frame, box section rims, wire spokes |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"min- width:22em\" |+ UCI best human effort (1986–2014) |- !width=120|Date !width=140|Rider !Age !Velodrome !Distance (km) !Equipment |- | 20 September 1986 || Jeannie Longo-Ciprelli || 27 || OTC Velodrome, Colorado, United States of America || 44.770 || |- | 23 September 1987 || Jeannie Longo-Ciprelli || 28 || OTC Velodrome, Colorado, United States of America || 44.933 || |- | 1 October 1989 || Jeannie Longo-Ciprelli || 30 || Agustín Melgar Olympic Velodrome, Mexico City, Mexico || 46.352 || |- | 29 April 1995 || Catherine Marsal ||24 || Bordeaux, France || 47.112 || Corima carbon composite bicycle.

Records previously removed for Chris Boardman and Graeme Obree were returned, however the benchmark record would remain at set in 2005 by Ondrej Sosenka, even though that was not the farthest distance. Under the new regulations riders may use any bike allowed by the UCI standards for endurance track events in place at the time of the attempt. Riders are required to be part of the athlete biological passport program. However, of the men to attempt the record since the rule change, only four were on a UCI World Tour team at the time: Jens Voigt of Trek Factory Racing, Rohan Dennis of the BMC Racing Team, Alex Dowsett of the , and Victor Campenaerts of Lotto Soudal. Matthias Brändle was with IAM Cycling, then a UCI Professional Continental team. Jack Bobridge was on Team Budget Forklifts, an Australian UCI Continental team. Thomas Dekker had been released from World Tour team Garmin-Sharp several months before. Gustav Larsson was riding for the Professional Continental team Cult Energy Pro Cycling, whilst Bradley Wiggins had left the World Tour's shortly before his attempt, which was made in the colours of his own UCI Continental team . So far, 19 attempts have been made for the men's record, six successfully, while seven attempts have been made on the women's record, four of them successfully. === Unified hour record attempts (men's) === Following the change in the rules, German Jens Voigt became the first rider to attempt the hour, on 18 September 2014 at the Velodrome Suisse, Grenchen, Switzerland. He set a new record of , beating the previous record set by Sosenka by . On 30 October 2014, Matthias Brändle set a new record of at the World Cycling Center in Aigle, Switzerland. Further attempts by Australians Jack Bobridge, Rohan Dennis, and the Dutchman Thomas Dekker came within a few weeks, between 31 January and 25 February 2015. Dennis was the only one of the three to set a new record, and in doing so was the first rider to cover more than . Dekker's attempt at the Aguascalientes Bicentenary Velodrome was the first attempt to take place at appreciable altitude. Aguascalientes is at above sea level, while Melbourne is at only , and, although in Switzerland, Grenchen and Aigle are at and , and not in the mountains. High altitude is thought to result in faster times, providing the rider takes the time to acclimatise to the conditions. This is because the air density decreases with an increase in altitude, which reduces the aerodynamic drag. Having postponed an earlier scheduled attempt due to a broken collarbone incurred in a crash while training, British cyclist Alex Dowsett exceeded Dennis' mark, with a new record of , at Manchester Velodrome on 2 May 2015. On 7 June 2015, Sir Bradley Wiggins broke Dowsett's record, by completing a distance of at the Lee Valley VeloPark in London. On 16 April 2019 Victor Campenaerts was the first to exceed 55 km/h by completing a distance of at the Velodromo Bicentenario in Aguascalientes. The UCI rules require an athlete to participate in its anti-doping system, including having a biological passport. When Daniel Bigham rode to break Wiggins' British national record, he was ineligible to attempt the UCI record as he was not part of the anti-doping system, estimating it would cost him £8,000. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ Men's UCI hour record attempts and record holders (since the rule revision in 2014) |- !Date !Rider !Age ! style=\"width: 15%;\" | Velodrome !Distance (km) ! style=\"width: 12%;\" | Supported by ! style=\"width: 27%;\" | Equipment ! style=\"width: 30%;\" | Notes |- | 18 September 2014|| Jens Voigt || 43 || Velodrome Suisse, Grenchen, Switzerland (altitude 450m) || 51.110 (New record)|| Trek Bicycle Corporation || Triathlon handlebar, Trek carbon fibre tubing frame, disc wheels, chain on a 55/14 gear ratio.|| 20px First attempt under the new rule-set and oldest record holder at 43 years old and one day. 20px Set new German national record. |- | 30 October 2014 || Matthias Brändle || 24 || World Cycling Centre Aigle, Switzerland (altitude 380m) || 51.852 (New record)|| IAM Cycling || Triathlon handlebar, SCOTT carbon fibre tubing frame, disc wheels, chain on a 55/13 gear ratio. || 20px 20px Set new Austrian national record. |- | 31 January 2015 || Jack Bobridge || 24 || Darebin International Sports Centre, Melbourne, Australia || 51.300 (Failure)|| Cycling Australia || Triathlon handlebar, Cervelo carbon fibre tubing frame, disc wheels. || Failed to set new hour record. 20px Beat Brad McGee's previous Australian national record of 50.300 km set in 2000. |- | 8 February 2015 || Rohan Dennis || 24 || Velodrome Suisse, Grenchen, Switzerland (altitude 450m) || 52.491 (New record)|| BMC Racing Team || Triathlon handlebar, BMC carbon fibre tubing frame, disc wheels, chain on a 56/14 gear ratio. || 20px 20px Beat Jack Bobridge's previous Australian national record of 51.300 km set in January 2015. |- | 25 February 2015 || Thomas Dekker || 30 || Aguascalientes Bicentenary Velodrome, Aguascalientes, Mexico || 52.221 (Failure) || Koga || Koga TeeTeeTrack with Mavic Comete Track wheels, Koga components, Rotor cranks with a KMC (3/32\") chain on a 58/14 gear ratio. || First attempt at altitude (2000 m).

In December 2014, it was announced that British Paralympian Sarah Storey would be the first woman to attempt the record following the unified rule change. She attempted the record on 28 February 2015 at Lee Valley Velo Park in London, setting new British, Para-Cycling and Masters Age 35–39 records but missing out on the Elite record with a distance of . American Molly Shaffer Van Houweling broke the women's UCI Hour Record, riding a distance of on 12 September 2015 in Aguascalientes, Mexico. Van Houweling had set three new US Hour Records in the year prior. The first was set on 15 December 2014, in Carson, California, with a distance of . The second was set on 25 February 2015, in Aguascalientes, Mexico, with a distance of . The third was set on 3 July 2015, also in Aguascalientes, Mexico, with a distance of . This last mark was also the Pan-American and World Masters Age 40–44 record at the time, and exceeded the distance of the UCI hour record of van Moorsel. However, it did not qualify as the UCI Hour Record because Van Houweling had only been enrolled in the athlete biological passport program for three and a half months prior to setting this record. The UCI requires that riders be enrolled in this program for 5–10 months before they are eligible to set this mark. From 24 August 2015, Van Houweling was eligible to attempt the UCI Hour Record. In October 2015, Australian rider Bridie O'Donnell announced her intention to aim for the hour record in January 2016. She broke the women's hour at the Adelaide Super-Drome on 22 January 2016, riding 46.882 km. Her age was 41. Her record was broken by American rider Evelyn Stevens in the next month - the new record was 47.980 km, more than a kilometer nearer to the 50 km barrier. Italian rider Vittoria Bussi, after two unsuccessful attempts on 7 October 2017 and on 12 September 2018, broke Stevens' world record by 27 metres riding on 13 September 2018. Joscelin (Joss) Lowden set a new world record on 30 September 2021 with a distance of , beating the previous record by just under 400 metres, and also surpassing Jeannie Longo's Best Human Effort distance. Lowden completed a total of 193 laps of the Tissot Velodrome in Grenchen, Switzerland. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ Women's UCI hour record attempts and record holders (since the rule revision in 2014) |- !width=120|Date !width=140|Rider !Age !Velodrome !Distance (km) !Supported by !Equipment !Notes |- | 28 February 2015|| Sarah Storey || 37 || Lee Valley VeloPark, London, United Kingdom || 45.502 (Failure) || || Ridley Arena Carbon track bike with triathlon bars, Pro rear disc wheel, front disk wheel, Shimano Dura-Ace groupset. || 20px Beat Yvonne McGregor's previous British national record of 43.689 set in April 2002.

The first attempt on a para-cycling hour record after the new regulations were extended to para-cycling was by Irishman Colin Lynch in the C2 category, bettering the accepted best performance previously set by Laurent Thirionet in 1999 by 2 kilometres, and setting the first 'ratified' para-cycling world hour record. The mark of 43.133 km was achieved on 1 October at the National Cycling Centre in Manchester, Great Britain. ===Men's UCI para-cycling hour record=== ;Unified regulations (since 2016) {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ C1 Men's UCI para- cycling hour record holders |- !width=120|Date !width=140|Rider !Age !Velodrome !Distance (km) !Supported by !Equipment !Notes |- | 1 December 2018 | Michael Teuber | 50 | Berlin, Germany | 42.583 (New record) | | | |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ C2 Men's UCI para- cycling hour record holders |- !width=120|Date !width=140|Rider !Age !Velodrome !Distance (km) !Supported by !Equipment !Notes |- | 1 October 2016 | Colin Lynch |45 | Manchester Velodrome, Manchester, England | 43.133 (New record) | | | |} ===Women's UCI para-cycling hour record=== ;Unified regulations (since 2016) {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ C5 Women's UCI para- cycling hour record holders |- !width=120|Date !width=140|Rider !Age !Velodrome !Distance (km) !Supported by !Equipment !Notes |- | 28 February 2015 | Sarah Storey |37 | Manchester Velodrome Manchester, England | 45.502 (New record) | | | |} ===Historical para-cycling hour record === ;Men's UCI para-cycling hour record – Best Hour Performance & Absolute Hour Record (1991–2016) {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ C5 Men's UCI para-cycling hour record holders |- !width=120|Date !width=140|Rider !Age !Velodrome !Distance (km) !Supported by !Equipment !Notes |- | 11 September 1991 | Fransisco Trujillo | | Bordeaux, France | 44.661 | | |Best Hour Performance |- | 13 December 2014 | Andrea Tarlao | | Montichiari Velodrome, Montichiari, Italy | 47.569 | | |Absolute Hour Record |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ C3 & CP3 Men's UCI para-cycling hour record holders |- !width=120|Date !width=140|Rider !Age !Velodrome !Distance (km) !Supported by !Equipment !Notes |- | 25 September 1995 | Thomas Evans | | Manchester Velodrome Manchester, England | 40.070 | | |Best Hour Performance |- | 8 January 2005 | Darren Kenny | | Manchester Velodrome Manchester, England | 41.817 | | |Best Hour Performance |- | 14 February 2009 | Darren Kenny | | Copenhagen, Denmark | 40.516 | | |Absolute Hour Record |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ C2 Men's UCI para- cycling hour record holders |- !width=120|Date !width=140|Rider !Age !Velodrome !Distance (km) !Supported by !Equipment !Notes |- | 6 November 1999 | Laurent Thirionet | | Bordeaux, France | 41.031 | | |Best Hour Performance |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ C1 Men's UCI para-cycling hour record holders |- !width=120|Date !width=140|Rider !Age !Velodrome !Distance (km) !Supported by !Equipment !Notes |- | 8 May 2005 | Michael Teuber | 37 | Augsburg, Germany | 39.326 | | |Best Hour Performance |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ Tandem Men's UCI para-cycling hour record holders |- !width=120|Date !width=140|Rider !Age !Velodrome !Distance (km) !Supported by !Equipment !Notes |- | 11 November 1994 | Jan Mulder Richard Belmer | | Moscow, Russia | 48.696 | | |Best Hour Performance |- | 29 November 1997 | Herve Dechamp Guy Rouchouzo | | Bordeaux, France | 49.625 | | |Best Hour Performance |} ;Women's UCI para-cycling hour record – Best Hour Performance & Absolute Hour Record (1991–2016) {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ C5 Women's UCI para- cycling hour record holders |- !width=120|Date !width=140|Rider !Age !Velodrome !Distance (km) !Supported by !Equipment !Notes |- | 28 February 2015 | Sarah Storey | | Lee Valley VeloPark, England | 45.502 | | | |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ Tandem Women's UCI para-cycling hour record holders |- !width=120|Date !width=140|Rider !Age !Velodrome !Distance (km) !Supported by !Equipment !Notes |- | 19 September 2005 | Lindy Hou Toireasa Gallagher | | Dunc Gray Velodrome, Sydney, Australia | 42.930 | | |Absolute Hour Record |} ==Masters records== ===Current records by age- group=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
