 "text": "25 (twenty-five) is the natural number following 24 and preceding 26. ==In mathematics== thumb|25 is a square It is a square number, being 52 = 5 × 5\\. It is one of two two-digit numbers whose square and higher powers of the number also ends in the same last two digits, e.g. 252 = 625, the other is 76. It is the smallest square that is also a sum of two (non-zero) squares: 25 = 32 \\+ 42. Hence it often appears in illustrations of the Pythagorean theorem. 25 is the sum of the five consecutive single-digit odd natural numbers 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9. 25 is a centered octagonal number, a centered square number, and an automorphic number. 25 percent (%) is equal to .

According to the Shapiro inequality, 25 is the smallest odd integer n such that there exist x, x, ..., x such that :\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{x_i}{x_{i+1}+x_{i+2}} < \\frac{n}{2} where x = x, x = x. Within base 10 one can readily test for divisibility by 25 by seeing if the last two digits of the number match 00, 25, 50 or 75. ==In science== *The atomic number of manganese. *The average percentage DNA overlap of an individual with their half-sibling, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, identical twin cousin (offspring of identical twins), or double cousin. ==In religion== *In Ezekiel's vision of a new temple: The number twenty-five is of cardinal importance in Ezekiel's Temple Vision (in the Bible, Ezekiel chapters 40–48). *In Islam, there are 25 prophets mentioned in the Quran. ==In sports== * Before 2020, the size of the full roster on a Major League Baseball team for most of the season, except for regular-season games on or after September 1, when teams expanded their roster to 40 players. * The size of the playing roster on a Nippon Professional Baseball team for a particular game.
