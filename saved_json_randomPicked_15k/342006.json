 "text": "thumb|Map – showing – the Geographical location of Fort-Worth, Tex., and Rail- Roads, 1888 Boosterism is the act of promoting (\"boosting\") a town, city, or organization, with the goal of improving public perception of it. Boosting can be as simple as talking up the entity at a party or as elaborate as establishing a visitors' bureau. It has been somewhat associated with American small towns. ==History== During the expansion of the American and Canadian West, boosterism became epidemic as the leaders and owners of small towns made extravagant predictions for their settlement, in the hope of attracting more residents and, not coincidentally, inflating the prices of local real estate. During the nineteenth century, competition for economic success among newly founded cities led to overflow of booster literature that listed the visible signs of growth, cited statistics on population and trade and looked to local geography for town success reasons. The 1871 humorous speech The Untold Delights of Duluth, delivered by Democratic U.S. Representative J. Proctor Knott, lampooned boosterism. Boosterism is also a major theme of two novels by Sinclair Lewis--Main Street (published 1920) and Babbitt (1922). As indicated by an editorial that Lewis wrote in 1908 entitled \"The Needful Knocker\", boosting was the opposite of knocking. The editorial explained: The short story \"Jeeves and the Hard-boiled Egg\" (1917) by P.G. Wodehouse includes an encounter with a convention visiting from the fictional town of Birdsburg, Missouri who talk up their town: Boosting is also done in political settings, especially in regard to disputed policies or controversial events. The UK prime minister Boris Johnson is strongly associated with such behaviour. ==See also== *Advertising *Potemkin Village *Promotion (marketing) *Puffery ==References== ==External links== *The Promised Land, by Pierre Berton *Babbitt by Sinclair Lewis * The Untold Delights of Duluth, a speech by a US congressman in 1871, introduced by David McCullough Category:Promotion and marketing communications Category:History of United States expansionism Category:Community development Category:Political science terminology",
