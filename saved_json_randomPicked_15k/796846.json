 "text": "Wallace's hanging parrot (Loriculus flosculus) also known as the Flores hanging parrot, is a small (length: 11â€“12 cm) parrot endemic to the island of Flores. This is an arboreal parrot. The male is predominantly green, with a red bill, a red spot on the throat, orange legs and dark red nape, bright red rump and uppertail-coverts. The female has the red on the throat reduced or absent. This parrot qualifies as Endangered as it has a very small range and population. The main threat is habitat destruction. The current population is estimated at between 2,500 and 10,000. It is named after Alfred Russel Wallace, a British naturalist, explorer, geographer, and biologist. == References == == External links == * BirdLife Species Factsheet Wallace's hanging parrot Category:Birds of Flores Wallace's hanging parrot",
