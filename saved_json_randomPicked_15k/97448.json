 "text": "Nevada County is a county located in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Arkansas. As of the 2010 census, the population was 8,997, less than half of its peak in 1920. The county seat is Prescott. Nevada County is Arkansas's 63rd county, formed during the Reconstruction era on March 20, 1871, from portions of Hempstead, Ouachita and Columbia counties. It was named after the state of Nevada because of the perceived similarity between their physical shapes; the Arkansas county's shape, inverted, roughly follows the same outline as the state's boundary. It is an alcohol prohibition or dry county. Dorcheat Bayou, a 122-mile stream, begins in Nevada County. It flows south into Columbia County and across the border into Webster Parish, Louisiana, where it flows into Lake Bistineau and ultimately Loggy Bayou, forming a continuous passage to the Red River. In the 19th century, the bayou was navigable for three to six months by steamboat from Bistineau to Minden. The watershed had fertile farmland, timberland and swampland. The bayou is now popular for fishing and its natural environment. ==History== This area was historically occupied by members of the Caddoan Confederacy, whose territory extended into present-day Texas and Louisiana. They settled along the waterways, using them for transportation and fishing. Colonial French and later European-American settlers also took over lands along the waterways, which formed their basic transportation routes well into the 19th century. After the Congress repealed Prohibition in the early 20th century, Nevada County voted to retain it and the county is still \"dry.\" ==Geography== According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.5%) is water. The county is bounded on the north by the Little Missouri River, a branch of the Ouachita River, and drained by several tributaries of that stream and of Red River. Nevada County is alternately considered as part of the greater regions of South Arkansas or Southwest Arkansas. ===Major highways=== *20px Interstate 30 *20px U.S. Highway 67 *25px U.S. Highway 278 *25px U.S. Highway 371 *20px Highway 19 *20px Highway 24 *20px Highway 32 *20px Highway 51 *20px Highway 53 ===Adjacent counties=== *Clark County (northeast) *Ouachita County (east) *Columbia County (south) *Lafayette County (southwest) *Hempstead County (west) *Pike County (northwest) ==Demographics== The population declined by more than half from 1920 to 1970, due to mechanization of agriculture and the decline of the lumber industry causing loss of jobs. In addition, blacks left in the Great Migration to midwestern and western industrial cities, where they found better work and less social oppression. ===2020 census=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Nevada County racial composition !Race !Num. !Perc. |- |White (non-Hispanic) |5,145 |61.91% |- |Black or African American (non-Hispanic) |2,433 |29.28% |- |Native American |37 |0.45% |- |Asian |41 |0.49% |- |Other/Mixed |300 |3.61% |- |Hispanic or Latino |354 |4.26% |} As of the 2020 United States census, there were 8,310 people, 3,397 households, and 2,263 families residing in the county. ===2000 census=== As of the 2000 United States Census, there were 9,955 people, 3,893 households, and 2,721 families residing in the county.

Former Governor Bill Clinton won this county twice in his presidential runs: 1992 and 1996. Clinton's vice president, Al Gore won the county in 2000, the most recent Democrat to do so. Donald Trump carried nearly 62% of the vote in this county in the 2016 race, a showing of rural strength by Trump and cultural detachment from a more socially liberal Democratic Party than the one led by Bill Clinton. His wife and Arkansas' former first lady, Hillary Clinton, mustered about 36%. {| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" |+ Nevada County, Arkansas vote by party in presidential elections |- !
