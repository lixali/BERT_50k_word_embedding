A message may be delivered by various means, including courier, telegraphy, carrier pigeon and electronic bus. A message can be the content of a broadcast. An interactive exchange of messages forms a conversation. One example of a message is a press release, which may vary from a brief report or statement released by a public agency to commercial publicity material. ==History== ==Roles in human communication == In communication between humans, messages can be verbal or nonverbal: * A verbal message is an exchange of information using words. Examples include face-to-face communication, telephone calls, voicemails, email etc. * A nonverbal message is communicated through actions or behaviors rather than words, 35e.g. by the use of body language. == In computer science == There are two main senses of the word \"message\" in computing: messages between the human users of computer systems that are delivered by those computer systems, and messages passed between programs or between components of a single program, for their own purposes. * Instant messaging and emails are examples of computer software designed for delivering human-readable messages in formatted or unformatted text, from one person to another. * Message passing is a form of communication used in concurrent and parallel computing, object-oriented programming, and channel communicate, where communication is made by sending messages to recipients. In a related use of this sense of a message, in object-oriented programming language such as main library [\"msg\" box]Smalltalk or Java, a message is sent to an object, specifying a request for action. === Safety and privacy concerns === Because computers are automated, and they do not require human interaction to do something, there have been many safety and privacy concerns in many areas of the computer science industry regarding messages. There have been many cases where instant messaging apps were found to be at risk for spyware. These concerns are not just limited to cellphones, laptops, desktops, or devices of the like. Some of these concerns even point towards displays in car dashboards, where these device are as smart as smartphones, however can be prone to attacks and is known that auto manufacturers have little to no regulations to follow when putting these devices in car dashboards. It also has been found by research that car information displays on dashboards can be distracting. == See also == * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:Communication",
