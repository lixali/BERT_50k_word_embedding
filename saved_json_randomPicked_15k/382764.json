He was son of James Minto, a farmer, and his wife Barbara Copland.Alexander Mackie and Sayoni Basu, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, \"Minto, William (1845–1893), literary scholar\" entry. Retrieved 17 April 2017. He was educated at the University of Aberdeen, graduating as an M.A. in 1865 and \"winning the leading prizes in mathematics, classics and philosophy\".Trevor Royle, The Mainstream Companion to Scottish Literature, London: The Macmillan Press, 1983; republished as an ebook by Mainstream Publishing Company (Edinburgh) Ltd., 1993, \"Minto, William\" entry. In 1866 he began studying at Merton College, Oxford, but left the following year without taking a degree. He became assistant professor under Alexander Bain, who held the Regius Chair of Logic and the Regius Chair of English Literature at the University of Aberdeen. During this period he wrote the book, Manual of English Prose Literature, Biographical and Critical, which was published in 1872 and which was \"distinguished by sound judgment and sympathetic appreciation\". In 1873 Minto moved to London and from 1874 to 1878 he contributed literary and political articles to The Examiner, and later he was on the leader-writing staff of The Daily News and The Pall Mall Gazette. During this period Minto \"was considered to be an able and pungent critic of Lord Beaconsfield's imperial policies\". In 1880 Bain retired and Minto succeeded him as Regius Professor of Logic and English Literature at Aberdeen, a post he held until his death. \"Though Logic and Rhetoric had long been combined in a single Chair at the Scottish universities, Minto's occupancy of the Chair was marked by a much great[er] [sic] emphasis on the study and teaching of literature than logic.\"William Minto 1845–1893, International Association for Scottish Philosophy, scottishphilosophy.org.
