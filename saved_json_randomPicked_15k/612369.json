 "text": "Booneville is an unincorporated community in Dallas County, Iowa, United States. It is part of the Des Moines-West Des Moines Metropolitan Statistical Area. ==History== Booneville was laid out as a town in 1871. The community is named after the William and Susan Boone family, who were prominent local landowners. Though once a thriving community, Booneville eventually saw a decline in population with reduced use of the local railroad as well as urban sprawl. The town of Booneville now comprises a restaurant and bar; a Methodist church; the United States Post Office for ZIP code 50038; and a small RV park (part of a mobile home community). Booneville lies directly northeast of the Raccoon River, and a boat ramp near the town is used frequently. Although Booneville lies in the annexation path of West Des Moines, situated only a few miles away to the east, West Des Moines officials have stated that there are no plans to annex Booneville in the near future. ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Dallas County, Iowa Category:Des Moines metropolitan area Category:Unincorporated communities in Iowa Category:1871 establishments in Iowa Category:Populated places established in 1871",
