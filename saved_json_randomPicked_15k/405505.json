In the 1980s, Coggiola freelanced for car manufacturers, sometimes executing third-party designs, such as Trevor Fiores design of the concept car Citroën Karin, the Lamborghini Portofino or prototypes of the Renault Mégane. Coggiola also produced individual vehicles, special ordered by customers as one-off cars, including Bentley B2 and B3 coupes and convertibles,Abbildung des umgebauten Volvo 164 auf der Internetseite www.volvobertone.com abgerufen am 1.
