 "text": "The Cap Tourmente National Wildlife Area is a National Wildlife Area located on the north shore of the Saint Lawrence River in the National Provincial Capital Region of Quebec, established on 28 April 1978. It is one of the critical habitats for the greater snow goose during migration. Flocks of tens of thousands of these birds stop over to feed on the bullrushes in the spring and fall. The tidal marsh was recognized as a wetland of international significance per the Ramsar Convention in 1981, the first North American site to receive that distinction. Within the wildlife refuge is a historic farm site, La Petite-Ferme du cap Tourmente, which was begun by Samuel de Champlain in 1626, as a food source for the fledgling Habitation at Quebec City. Later, the farm was purchased and run for nearly 300 years by and for the Seminary of Quebec. A farm house built around 1667 still stands, and is at the core of La Petite-Ferme du cap Tourmente National Historic Site, designated in 2018.Government of Canada Announces 12 New National Historic Designations, Parks Canada news release, March 27, 2018 File:CapTourmenteOieBlanche.JPG|Snow goose File:Spizelloides arborea CT5.jpg|American tree sparrow (Spizelloides arborea) ==References== ==External links== *Cap Tourmente National Wildlife Area at Environment Canada Category:Ramsar sites in Canada Category:Protected areas of Capitale-Nationale Category:Nature centres in Canada Category:National Wildlife Areas of Canada Category:Canada geography articles needing translation from French Wikipedia",
