 "text": "thumb|Bluetail Mole Skink (Eumeces egregius lividus) Highlands County, Florida Plestiodon egregius, the mole skink, is a species of small lizard endemic to the Southeastern United States. ==Taxonomy== The species is subdivided into five subspecies, including the nominotypical subspecies: *Florida Keys mole skink, P. e. egregius Baird, 1859: occurs only on some of the Florida Keys. *Cedar Key mole skink, P. e. insularis (Mount, 1965): occurs only on three islands at Cedar Key. *Bluetail mole skink, P. e. lividus (Mount, 1965): occurs only in interior central Florida; shares its Florida Scrub habitat with the Sand Skink. *Peninsula mole skink, P. e. onocrepis Cope, 1871. *Northern mole skink, P. e. similis (McConkey, 1957). The species was first described by Baird in 1859 as Plestiodon egregius. In 1871, P. onocrepis was described by Cope. In 1875, the two species were reassigned to the genus Eumeces. In 1935, two subspecies were defined, E. e. egregius and E. e. onocrepis, and in 1957, E. e. similis was separated from E. e. egregius. In 2005 North American members of genus Eumeces were reassigned to Plestiodon. ==Status== The first three subspecies listed above are protected, and the bluetail mole skink is classified as a federally-threatened species since 1987. The major threats to all three subspecies are habitat destruction due to residential, commercial, and agricultural development and over-collection by herpetological enthusiasts. The remaining two subspecies are rather common, though elusive. The northern mole skink also occurs in southern Alabama and Georgia. ==Habitat== Mole skinks are found in sandhills and scrub. They often like to be buried underground and especially like to bask in the upper layers of Southeastern pocket gopher mounds. ==Reproduction== Mole skinks reach sexual maturity after one year. They mate in winter; the female lays three to seven eggs in spring in a shallow nest cavity less than below the surface. The eggs incubate for 31 to 51 days, during which time the female tends the nest. ==Bluetail mole skink== right|thumb|200px|Bluetail mole skink distribution ===Description=== The bluetail mole skink is a small, shiny, cylindrical lizard of a brownish color. Juveniles usually have a blue tail which makes up slightly more than half of the animal's total length. Regenerated tails and the tails of older individuals are typically pinkish. The legs are somewhat reduced in size and are used only during surface locomotion, not when the animal \"swims\" through the sand (Christman 1992). During the breeding season, males develop a colorful orange pattern on their sides. The bluetail mole skink grows to . ===Habitat and behavior=== It shares habitat with the sand skink, which is also endangered, but does not compete with it: whereas the sand skink feeds underground, the bluetail mole skink hunts on the surface. When threatened, it plays presents its tail and if refused, plays dead. ===Diet=== Like other mole skinks, it feeds primarily on cockroaches, spiders, and crickets. ===Geographic range=== It is found in central Florida. Map should also reflect Seminole and Orange counties. Also sighted in Brevard and Pasco Counties. ===Conservation status=== The bluetail mole skink is a federally-threatened species. ==References== ==External links== *Comprehensive overview of the Bluetail Mole Skink at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. *Multispecies Recovery Plan for South Florida, section on the Bluetail Mole Skink (PDF file, 147 KB). ==Selected literature== *Baird, S.F. 1859.
