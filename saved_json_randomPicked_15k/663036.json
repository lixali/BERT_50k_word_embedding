 "text": "Sunset Boulevard is a musical with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber, and lyrics and book by Don Black and Christopher Hampton. It is based on the 1950 film of the same title. The plot revolves around Norma Desmond, a faded star of the silent screen era, living in the past in her decaying mansion on the fabled Los Angeles street. When young screenwriter Joe Gillis accidentally crosses her path, she sees in him an opportunity to make her return to the big screen, with romance and tragedy to follow. Opening first in London in 1993, the musical has had several long runs internationally and enjoyed extensive tours. However, it has been the subject of several legal battles and ultimately lost money due to its extraordinary running costs. ==Background == From approximately 1952 to 1956, Gloria Swanson worked with actor Richard Stapley (aka Richard Wyler) and cabaret singer and pianist Dickson Hughes on a musical adaptation originally entitled Starring Norma Desmond, then Boulevard!Based on liner notes to Boulevard! CD release by Richard Stapley, Tim J. Hutton, and Steven M. Warner It ended on a happier note than the film, with Norma allowing Joe to leave and pursue a happy ending with Betty. Rights holder Paramount Pictures originally had given Swanson verbal permission to proceed with the musical, but there had been no formal legal arrangement. On 20 February 1957, Paramount executive Russell Holman wrote to Swanson asking her to cease work on the project because \"it would be damaging for the property to be offered to the entertainment public in another form as a stage musical.\"The Bad and the Beautiful: Hollywood in the Fifties by Sam Kashner and Jennifer MacNair, W.W. Norton & Company, Inc., 2002, p. 346, In 1994, Hughes incorporated material from the production into Swanson on Sunset, based on his and Stapley's experiences in writing Boulevard!. A recording of the entire score, which had been housed in the Gloria Swanson archives at the University of Texas, was released on CD in 2008. In the early 1960s, Stephen Sondheim outlined a musical stage adaptation and went so far as to compose the first scene with librettist Burt Shevelove. A chance encounter with Billy Wilder at a cocktail party gave Sondheim the opportunity to introduce himself and ask the original film's co-screenwriter and director his opinion of the project (which was to star Jeanette MacDonald). \"You can't write a musical about Sunset Boulevard,\" Wilder responded, \"it has to be an opera. After all, it's about a dethroned queen\". Sondheim immediately aborted his plans. A few years later, when he was invited by Hal Prince to write the score for a film remake starring Angela Lansbury as a fading musical comedian rather than a silent film star, Sondheim declined, citing his conversation with Wilder.On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder by Ed Sikov, Hyperion, New York, New York, 1998, pp. 467–468, When Lloyd Webber saw the film in the early 1970s, he was inspired to write what he pictured as the title song for a theatrical adaptation, fragments of which he instead incorporated into Gumshoe.'...Inspired by Sunset Boulevard' from Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group website In 1976, after a conversation with Hal Prince, who had the theatrical rights to Sunset, Lloyd Webber wrote \"an idea for the moment when Norma Desmond returns to Paramount Studios\"; Lloyd Webber did no further work on the play until after 1989's Aspects of Love. At that point, Lloyd Webber \"felt it was the subject [he] had to compose next\", though by February 1990 he had announced plans to turn Really Useful Group private so he could \"make movies rather than musicals.\"Lloyd Webber in Accord For Buyback of Company, a February 1990 article from The New York Times In 1991, Lloyd Webber asked Amy Powers, a lawyer from New York with no professional lyric-writing experience, to write the lyrics for Sunset Boulevard. Don Black was later brought in to work with Powers; the two wrote the version that was performed in 1991 at Lloyd Webber's Sydmonton Festival. This original version starred Ria Jones as Norma, and Michael Ball as Joe Gillis, directed by Andrew MacBean.Ansdell, Caroline. \"20 Questions With...

Lloyd Webber borrowed several of the tunes from his 1986 mini-musical Cricket, written with Tim Rice, which had been performed at Windsor Castle and later at the 1986 Sydmonton Festival.\"Tim Rice – Cricket\" timrice.co.uk ==Synopsis== ===Act I=== The place: A mansion on Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, 5 a.m. A homicide has been reported. Joe Gillis sets the scene (\"Prologue\"), noting that it involves \"an old-time movie star / Maybe the biggest star of all\", and that, if you want to know the \"real facts\", you've \"come to the right party.\" Flashback to... Hollywood, 1949 - where a down-on-his-luck screenwriter, Joe Gillis, is trying to hustle up some work at Paramount Studios (\"Let's Have Lunch\"). His appointment with a producer goes poorly when the executive rejects both Joe's proposed script and a loan to bring his car payments up to date. Joe does, however, meet Betty Schaefer, a pretty, young script editor who suggests they collaborate to rework one of his earlier screenplays (\"Every Movie's a Circus\"). As they chat, car repossession agents spot Joe, who quickly escapes. During the ensuing chase, Joe evades his pursuers by pulling in to the garage of a palatial but dilapidated mansion on Sunset Boulevard. Beckoned inside the house, Joe encounters Norma Desmond (\"Surrender\"), a star actress of the silent-film era. Taken aback, Joe comments, \"You used to be in pictures; you used to be big,\" to which Norma retorts, \"I am big – it's the pictures that got small!\" (\"With One Look\") The gloomy estate is inhabited only by Norma and Max von Mayerling, her loyal butler and chauffeur. Although decades past her prime and mostly forgotten by the public, Norma is convinced she is as beautiful and popular as ever. Max perpetuates this illusion by shielding her from the realities of life out of the limelight and by writing her letters purportedly from still-devoted fans. Norma informs Joe that she plans to make her comeback with Salome, a script she has written for Cecil B. DeMille to direct with her in the starring role as the teenage biblical temptress (\"Salome\"). Dubious but sensing opportunity, Joe accepts her offer to work on editing the script. Norma insists that Joe stay in her home while they collaborate on Salome (\"The Greatest Star of All\"). Joe immediately realizes the script is incoherent, but because Norma won't allow a major rewrite, the revision drags on for months. During this time Joe is virtually imprisoned within the house, but he does break away to fulfill his commitment to Betty. Their working relationship blossoms into a romance that has her reconsidering her engagement to Joe's best friend, Artie Green (\"Girl Meets Boy\"). Blind to Joe's opportunism, Norma lavishes him with gifts that include a wardrobe makeover and he becomes her kept man (\"The Lady's Paying\"). She declares her love for him and turns quite possessive (\"The Perfect Year\"); when he leaves her to attend Artie's New Year's Eve party (\"This Time Next Year\"), she is distraught and attempts suicide. As a conciliatory gesture, Joe reluctantly returns to work on Salome. ===Act II=== Joe is now living in luxury at Norma Desmond's mansion, for reasons he bluntly states are mercenary (\"Sunset Boulevard\"). A cryptic message from Paramount has Norma certain that DeMille is eager to discuss her script (\"There's Been A Call\"). She drops in on the set of his current film and is greeted warmly by former colleagues and the famed director himself, but he is non-committal about Salome (\"As If We Never Said Goodbye\"). Meanwhile, Max discovers the studio had called to ask about Norma's Isotta Fraschini, not her screenplay. However, a delusional Norma leaves the lot convinced she'll soon be back in front of the cameras and begins to prepare for the role (\"Eternal Youth Is Worth a Little Suffering\"). Increasingly paranoid, Norma deduces that Joe and Betty are more than just friends (\"Too Much in Love to Care\"). She calls Betty to reveal Joe's secret life at the mansion, but he overhears and grabs the phone to tell Betty to come see for herself. Realizing their affair is doomed, Joe brusquely tells her he enjoys being Norma's pet and that she should go back to Artie. Betty departs, confused and brokenhearted, and Joe tells Norma he is leaving her and returning to his hometown of Dayton, Ohio. He also bluntly informs her that Salome is an unfilmable script and her fans have long abandoned her. Furious and grief-stricken, Norma fatally shoots Joe three times as he storms out of the house. Now completely insane, Norma mistakes the swarms of police and reporters who arrive for studio personnel. Imagining herself on the set of Salome, she slowly descends her grand staircase and utters \"And now, Mr. DeMille, I am ready for my close-up.\" ==Major characters== *Norma Desmond — Mezzo-Soprano; a faded, eccentric, former silent screen star *Joe Gillis — Baritenor; a struggling young screenwriter *Max von Mayerling – Bass-Baritone; Norma's first husband and butler *Betty Schaefer – Soprano; A budding writer and Joe's love interest *Cecil B.

Of it, Wilder observed, \"The best thing they did was leave the script alone,\" and of Patti LuPone he exclaimed, \"She's a star from the moment she walks on stage\".On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder, p. 589 Reviews were mixed, according to the Associated Press (AP) review summary. That summary quoted, for example, the review by Michael Kuchwara for the AP: \"Some reviewers felt Lloyd Webber took the sting out of a cynical tale. 'Wilder's bitter brew has been diluted,' wrote AP Drama Critic Michael Kuchwara. He added: 'When LuPone is off stage, the show sags.'\"Wolf, Matt. \"'Sunset Boulevard' Has Mixed Reviews, But Billy Wilder's Impressed\", Associated Press, 13 July 1993, International News (no page number) Frank Rich wrote \"Much of the film's plot, dialogue and horror-movie mood are preserved, not to mention clips used to illustrate those sequences in which the faded silent-film star, Norma Desmond ...and her kept, young screenwriter, Joe Gillis, ... travel by car. The lyricist, Don Black ..., and the playwright, Christopher Hampton ..., smartly tailor their jokes to the original screenplay's style. At times, even Lloyd Webber gets into the Wilder swing. Both acts open with joltingly angry diatribes about Hollywood, part exposition-packed recitative and part song, in which the surprisingly dark, jazz-accented music, the most interesting I've yet encountered from this composer, meshes perfectly with the cynical lyrics. Anderson makes the sardonic Wilder voice an almost physical presence in Sunset Boulevard, but he is too often drowned out by both LuPone's Broadway belt and mechanical efforts of Lloyd Webber and his director, Trevor Nunn, to stamp the proven formulas of Phantom and Les Miz on even an intimate tale. At odd moments, the mammoth set advances like a glacier toward the audience or retreats, or, most dramatically, rises partly up into the flies, actors in tow.\" With associate director Andrew MacBean, the show closed for three weeks, re-opening on 19 April 1994, revamped to follow the Los Angeles production, with a second official \"opening\". The revamped musical had a new song, \"Every Movie's a Circus\", a new set, and new stars, Betty Buckley and John Barrowman.Lister, David. \"(SECOND) First Night / Hope dawns for 'Sunset Boulevard': 'Sunset Boulevard'; Adelphi Theatre\" The Independent (London, England), 20 April 1994 Michael Bauer, who had originally played DeMille, replaced Benzali as Max, a role he played until the end of the London run (and subsequently on the UK tour and in the BBC concert). Buckley and the production garnered rave reviews. David Lister of The Independent, for example wrote: \"The show looked an improvement on the one that got decidedly mixed reviews last summer.\" Betty Buckley went on to replace Glenn Close as Norma in the second year of the Broadway production.

The Los Angeles production also recorded a new cast album that is well regarded. It is also the only unabridged cast recording of the show, since the original London recording was trimmed by over thirty minutes. A controversy arose with this production after Faye Dunaway was hired to replace Glenn Close. Dunaway went into rehearsals with Rex Smith as Joe and Jon Cypher as Max.

Also in the cast were Alan Oppenheimer as Cecil B. DeMille and Vincent Tumeo making his Broadway debut as Artie Green. The production opened with the second-highest advance in the history of Broadway ticket sales at that time with advance sales of $37.5 million compared to $39 million for Miss Saigon in 1991 and on its second day, it set a single day sales record on Broadway of $1.4 million.Sunset Boulevard History Inspiration reallyuseful.com It closed on March 22, 1997 after playing 977 performances. Billy Wilder was in attendance on opening night and was coaxed onstage by Close for the curtain call. In a season with only one other musical nominated for Best Musical, the production won several Tony Awards; Glenn Close, with only one other nominee as Best Actress in a musical, won the Tony for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role. The New York Times theatre critic Vincent Canby commented about the Tony Awards for this year: \"Awards don't really tell you much when the competition is feeble or simply non-existent, as was the case the year that Sunset Boulevard won its Tony. Such prizes are for use in advertising and promotion and to impress the folks back home.\"Canby, Vincent.\"Why Whisper About It? 'The Life' Is a Joy\", The New York Times, 5 October 1997 Patti LuPone, who initially had been promised the Broadway run, sued Lloyd Webber and received a settlement reported to be $1 million. Frank Rich, in his book The Hot Seat,Hot Seat : Theater Criticism for The New York Times, 1980–1993 (Random House, 1998. ) from the author's website noted that these lawsuits contributed to Sunset Boulevard setting the record for the most money lost by a theatrical endeavour in the history of the United States. According to The New York Times, operating costs soared far beyond the budget, and the \"Broadway production has earned back, at best, 80% of the initial $13 million\".Weber, Bruce. \"Following 'Sunset,' Shadows Over Lloyd Webber's Empire\", The New York Times, 24 March 1997 For example, during the week of 2 July 1995, \"it cost $731,304 to run Sunset Boulevard, including... advertising fees of $138,352 (which had been budgeted at $40,000 a week).\" The road companies also generated large financial losses. Rich puts the final figure near or above US$20 million lost, making the show what he termed a \"flop-hit\", as it ran more than two years. The musical sold over a million tickets on Broadway. ===Touring productions=== The first national US tour in 1996 starring Linda BalgordCampbell, Jackie.\"Linda Balgord Cast As Norma For 'Sunset Boulevard' National Tour\" Rocky Mountain News, abstract from encyclopedia.com, 28 January 1996.

In August 2001, a UK tour commenced in Plymouth starring Faith Brown as Norma, opposite Earl Carpenter as Joe. The production had a completely new set, much simpler than the original London set, although the overall production remained closer to the original staging than the revamped US national tour. Carpenter left midway through the tour and was replaced by Jeremy Finch, who had previously understudied the role. The tour finished in late 2002 in Manchester and met with both excellent reviews and respectable ticket sales. Ria Jones, who originated the role of Norma Desmond in the 1991 Sydmonton Workshop and understudied Glenn Close in the 2016 West End revival, led a new production opening at Leicester's Curve Theatre on 16 September 2017 for a two-week run before embarking on a national tour around the United Kingdom. The tour, directed by Curve artistic by Nikolai Foster, transferred the musical into a Hollywood sound stage setting, designed by Colin Richmond, with acclaimed use of vintage archive film and projections designed by Douglas O'Connell. ===International productions=== A German production of the musical opened 7 December 1995 at the newly built Rhein-Main Theater in Niedernhausen near Wiesbaden, starring Helen Schneider and Sue Mathys (matinees) as Norma and Uwe Kröger as Joe. A cast recording (with Schneider and Kröger) was released in 1996. The role of Norma was later played by Daniela Ziegler and Christina Grimandi, with Schneider and, for the last few months, Sue Mathys both returning to play the lead. The production closed in May 1998. The original Canadian production opened in Toronto in 1995 with Diahann Carroll in the lead role. Her performance was also praised by critics, although the production closed sooner than expected. It also starred Rex Smith as Joe, Walter Charles as Max and Anita Louise Combe, who had understudied the role in the London production, as Betty. The production later moved to Vancouver for the final few months of its run. A highlights recording of this production was released on CD. In October 1996, the original Australian production of the musical opened at Melbourne's newly restored Regent Theatre.
