 "text": "The NCAA Division I Football Championship is an annual post-season college football game, played since 2006, used to determine a national champion of the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). From 1978 to 2005, the game was known as the NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship. The game serves as the final match of an annual postseason bracket tournament between top teams in FCS. Since 2013, 24 teams normally participate in the tournament, with some teams receiving automatic bids upon winning their conference championship, and other teams determined by a selection committee. The reigning national champions are the North Dakota State Bison, who won the championship game for the 2021 season (their 9th overall). The FCS is the highest division in college football to hold a playoff tournament sanctioned by the NCAA to determine its champion, as the four-team College Football Playoff currently used by the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) is not NCAA- sanctioned. ==History== ===Playoff format=== In the inaugural season of Division I-AA, the 1978 postseason included just four teams; three regional champions (East, West, and South) plus an at-large selection. The field doubled to eight teams in 1981, with champions of five conferences—Big Sky, Mid-Eastern, Ohio Valley, Southwestern, and Yankee—receiving automatic bids. The top four teams were seeded, and then matched against the four remaining teams based on geographical proximity. The tournament was expanded to 12 teams in 1982, with each of the top four seeds receiving a first-round bye and a home game in the quarterfinals. Champions of the Southern and Southland conferences also received automatic bids. The number of automatic bids has varied over time, due to changes in the number and size of conferences, with an automatic bid typically granted only to champions of conferences with at least six teams. Initially, the tournament was played in December; since the expansion to twelve teams in 1982, earlier rounds have been held in late November. The playoffs expanded to a 16-team format in 1986, requiring four postseason victories to win the title. Initially, only the top four teams were seeded, with other teams geographically placed in the bracket. From 1995 through 2000, all 16 teams were seeded, independent of geography. In 2001, the number of seeded teams was reduced to four, with the seeded teams assured of home games in early tournament rounds, and other teams once again placed in the bracket to minimize travel. Home team designation in games between unseeded teams is determined based on several factors, including attendance history and revenue potential. In April 2008, the NCAA announced that the playoff field would expand to 20 teams in 2010, with the Big South and Northeast Conference earning automatic bids for the first time. That bracket structure included seeding of the top five teams. Twelve teams received first- round byes; the remaining eight teams played first-round games, with the four winners advancing to face the top four seeds. The playoffs expanded to 24 teams beginning in 2013, with the champion of the Pioneer Football League receiving an automatic bid for the first time. The number of seeded teams was increased to eight, with the 16 unseeded teams playing in first-round games. For the 2020 season, affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the bracket was reduced to 16 teams. The bracket returned to 24 teams for the 2021 season. The field is traditionally set the Sunday before Thanksgiving and play begins that weekend. thumb|right|upright=1.5|Appalachian State's National Championship trophies for 2005 (I-AA), 2006 (FCS), and 2007 (FCS). {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size: 95%;\" |- |+ Playoff format |- ! style=\"background:#005FA6; color:#FFFFFF; border: 2px solid #000000;\"|Season(s) ! style=\"background:#005FA6; color:#FFFFFF; border: 2px solid #000000;\"|Bracket size ! style=\"background:#005FA6; color:#FFFFFF; border: 2px solid #000000;\"|Seeded teams ! style=\"background:#005FA6; color:#FFFFFF; border: 2px solid #000000;\"|1st round byes |- | 1978–1980 || 4 || — || — |- | 1981 || 8 || 4 || — |- | 1982–1985 || 12 || 4 || 4 |- | 1986–1994 || rowspan=3|16 || 4 || — |- | 1995–2000 || 16 || — |- | 2001–2009 || 4 || — |- | 2010–2012 || 20 || 5 || 12 |- | 2013–2019 || 24 || 8 || 8 |- | 2020 || 16 || 4 || — |- | 2021–present || 24 || 8 || 8 |} ====Team selection==== At-large selections and seeding within the bracket are determined by the FCS Playoff Selection Committee, which consists of one athletic director from each conference with an automatic bid. As of the 2018 season, there were 10 conferences with automatic bids and the selection committee made 14 at-large selections. An 11th automatic bid was added as of the 2021 season, reducing the number of at-large selections to 13. ===Championship final=== The tournament culminates with the national final, played between the two remaining teams from the playoff bracket. Unlike earlier round games in each year's playoff, which are played at campus sites, the title game is played at a site predetermined by the NCAA, akin to how the NFL predetermines the site for each Super Bowl. Originally played in December, with the 2010 expansion to a 20-team field, the final moved to January, with two or three weeks between the semifinals and final. The inaugural title game was played in 1978 in Wichita Falls, Texas. The 1979 and 1980 games were held in Orlando, Florida, and Sacramento, California, respectively, and the game returned to Wichita Falls for 1981 and 1982. The games played in Wichita Falls were known as the Pioneer Bowl, while the game played in Sacramento was known as the Camellia Bowl—both names were used for various NCAA playoff games played in those locations, and were not specific to the I-AA championship. In 1983 and 1984, the game was played in Charleston, South Carolina. In 1985 and 1986, Tacoma, Washington, hosted the game, which the NCAA branded as the \"Diamond Bowl\". The 1987 and 1988 games were played in Pocatello, Idaho; and from 1989 through 1991, in Statesboro, Georgia. The 1992 through 1996 games were held in Huntington, West Virginia; and from 1997 through 2009, the title game was played in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Since 2010, the title game has been played in Frisco, Texas, a suburb north of Dallas, at Toyota Stadium, a multi- purpose stadium primarily used by FC Dallas of Major League Soccer. The stadium was known as Pizza Hut Park until the day after the final of the 2011 season, and then as FC Dallas Stadium until September 2013. The original contract with Frisco began in the 2010 season and ran through the 2012 season. The contract has since been extended three times; first through the 2015 season, then through the 2019 season, and most recently through the 2024 season with an option for the 2025 season. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:left; font-size: 95%;\" |- !style=\"background:#005FA6; color:#FFFFFF; border: 2px solid #000000;\"|Season(s) !style=\"background:#005FA6; color:#FFFFFF; border: 2px solid #000000;\"|Venue !style=\"background:#005FA6; color:#FFFFFF; border: 2px solid #000000;\"|Location !style=\"background:#005FA6; color:#FFFFFF; border: 2px solid #000000;\"|Tenant NCAA team !style=\"background:#005FA6; color:#FFFFFF; border: 2px solid #000000;\"|Title games by tenant |- | 1978 || Memorial Stadium || Wichita Falls, Texas || none || N/A |- | 1979 || Orlando Stadium || Orlando, Florida || UCF Knights (D-III) || N/A |- | 1980 || Hughes Stadium || Sacramento, California || none || N/A |- | 1981–1982 || Memorial Stadium || Wichita Falls, Texas || none || N/A |- | 1983–1984 || Johnson Hagood Stadium || Charleston, South Carolina || The Citadel Bulldogs || none |- | 1985–1986 || Tacoma Dome || Tacoma, Washington || none || N/A |- | 1987 || Minidome || rowspan=2|Pocatello, Idaho || rowspan=2|Idaho State Bengals || rowspan=2|none |- | 1988 || Holt Arena |- | 1989–1991 || Paulson Stadium || Statesboro, Georgia || Georgia Southern Eagles || 2: 1989, 1990 |- | 1992–1996 || Marshall University Stadium || Huntington, West Virginia || Marshall Thundering Herd || 4: 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996 |- | 1997–2009 || Finley Stadium || Chattanooga, Tennessee || Chattanooga Mocs || none |- | 2010–2011 || Pizza Hut Park || rowspan=3|Frisco, Texas || rowspan=3|none || rowspan=3|N/A |- | 2012 || FC Dallas Stadium |- | 2013–present || Toyota Stadium |} at the time games were played earlier name of the same venue There have been six instances where a team whose venue was predetermined to host the final game advanced to play for the championship on their own field. Georgia Southern won both title games they played at Paulson Stadium, while Marshall had a 2–2 record in four title games they played at Marshall University Stadium (now known as Joan C. Edwards Stadium). ===Non-participants=== Three FCS conferences usually do not participate in the tournament: the Ivy League, Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC), and Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC). The Ivy League has been at the FCS level since 1982 and prohibits its members from awarding athletic scholarships in any sport, plays a strict ten-game regular season and does not participate in any postseason football, citing academic concerns. The MEAC and SWAC, two conferences consisting of historically black colleges and universities, opt to play the Celebration Bowl (which was established in 2015) instead of the FCS tournament. MEAC gave up its automatic spot in the tournament prior to the 2015 season, while the SWAC's regular season extends through the Turkey Day Classic and Bayou Classic at the end of November and the SWAC Championship Game is played in December. Teams from the MEAC and SWAC may accept at-large bids, so long as they aren't committed to other postseason games that would conflict with the tournament. The most recent MEAC and SWAC teams to accept bids were the 2016 North Carolina A&T; Aggies and 2021 Florida A&M; Rattlers, respectively. Historically, conferences in FCS that did not offer athletic scholarships were not granted automatic bids into the tournament and, although in theory were eligible for at-large bids, never received any. The last non-scholarship conference in the subdivision, the Pioneer Football League, now receives a tournament bid, which was initiated with the 2013 postseason. ===FCS conferences=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !style=\"background:#005FA6; color:#FFFFFF; border: 2px solid #000000;\"|Conference !style=\"background:#005FA6; color:#FFFFFF; border: 2px solid #000000;\"|Nickname !style=\"background:#005FA6; color:#FFFFFF; border: 2px solid #000000;\"|Founded !style=\"background:#005FA6; color:#FFFFFF; border: 2px solid #000000;\"|Football members !style=\"background:#005FA6; color:#FFFFFF; border: 2px solid #000000;\"|Sports !style=\"background:#005FA6; color:#FFFFFF; border: 2px solid #000000;\"|Headquarters |- |ASUN Conference |ASUN |1978 |At least 6 in 2022 |20 (21 in 2022) |Atlanta, Georgia |- |Big Sky Conference |Big Sky |1963 |13 (12 in 2022) |16 |Ogden, Utah |- |Big South Conference |Big South |1983 |9 (7 in 2022) |19 |Charlotte, North Carolina |- |Colonial Athletic Association |CAA |1979 |12 |21 |Richmond, Virginia |- |Ivy League % | |1954 |8 |33 |Princeton, New Jersey |- |Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference |MEAC |1970 |6 |16 |Norfolk, Virginia |- |Missouri Valley Football Conference |MVFC |1982 |11 |1 |St. Louis, Missouri |- |Northeast Conference |NEC |1981 |8 |22 |Somerset, New Jersey |- |Ohio Valley Conference |OVC |1948 |7 |18 |Brentwood, Tennessee |- |Patriot League | |1986 |7 |24 |Center Valley, Pennsylvania |- |Pioneer Football League |PFL |1991 |11 |1 |St. Louis, Missouri |- |Southern Conference |SoCon |1921 |9 |20 |Spartanburg, South Carolina |- |Southland Conference | |1963 |6 |17 |Frisco, Texas |- |Southwestern Athletic Conference |SWAC |1920 |12 |18 |Birmingham, Alabama |- |Western Athletic Conference |WAC |1962 |9 (8 in 2022, 7 in 2023) |20 |Englewood, Colorado |} % The Ivy League abstains from the championship tournament and all postseason play. The MEAC champion, since 2015, forgoes its automatic bid to allow its champion to participate in the Celebration Bowl. Non-champions are eligible for at-large bids (an example being the 2016 North Carolina A&T; Aggies football team). The SWAC abstains from the championship tournament to allow for a longer regular season, a conference final, and participation in the Celebration Bowl against the MEAC champion since 2015. ==Champions== For each season since the inaugural year of Division I-AA play, 1978, the following table lists the date of each title game and the champion. The score and runner-up are also noted, along with the host city, game attendance, and head coach of the championship team. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !style=\"background:#005FA6;
