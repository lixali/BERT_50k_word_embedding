 "text": "In Greek mythology, Poena or Poine () is the spirit of punishment and the attendant of punishment to Nemesis, the goddess of divine retribution. Her Roman equivalent may have been Ultio. The Latin word poena, \"pain, punishment, penalty\", gave rise to English words such as \"subpoena\" and \"pain\". The original word is the Ancient Greek poinḗ (), also meaning penalty. Poena was also treated as a host of spirits called poenai that were similar in nature to the Erinyes. ==References== ==External links== *LacusCurtius – Poena Category:Greek goddesses Category:Roman goddesses Category:Vengeance goddesses Category:Personifications in Greek mythology Category:Personifications in Roman mythology",
