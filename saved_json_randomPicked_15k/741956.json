It is run on the July Course at Newmarket over a distance of 6 furlongs (1,207 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in July. ==History== The event was established in 1947 as the Cherry Hinton Stakes, and the inaugural running was won by Great Fun. The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and for a period the Duchess of Cambridge Stakes was classed at Group 3 level. It was promoted to Group 2 status in 1996. The Duchess of Cambridge Stakes is currently held on the second day of Newmarket's three-day July Festival meeting. The equivalent race for male horses is the July Stakes. Several winners have gone on to achieve victory in the following season's 1,000 Guineas Stakes. The first was Sweet Solera in 1961, and the most recent was Attraction in 2004. In 2013 the race was renamed the Duchess of Cambridge Stakes in honour of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. In the same year the Windsor Forest Stakes at Royal Ascot was renamed the Duke of Cambridge Stakes. ==Records== Leading jockey (5 wins): * Walter Swinburn – Top Socialite (1984), Kerrera (1988), Chicarica (1990), Red Carnival (1994), Wannabe Grand (1998) Leading trainer (4 wins): * Henry Cecil – Roussalka (1974), Diminuendo (1987), Chimes of Freedom (1989), Musicale (1991) * Sir Michael Stoute – Top Socialite (1984), Kerrera (1988), Red Carnival (1994), Dazzle (1996) ==Winners since 1980== {| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" style=\"border- collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\" |- bgcolor=\"#77dd77\" align=\"center\" !
