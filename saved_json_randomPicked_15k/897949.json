 "text": "Bye Bye is an annual Quebecois New Year's Eve sketch comedy special, broadcast by Ici Radio-Canada Télé. The yearly program features sketches satirizing the past year's events, followed by a countdown to the next year itself. Originally beginning in 1968, Bye Bye '98 was the final edition of its first run, until the show was revived by the comedy troupe Rock et Belles Oreilles, who produced the 2006 and 2007 editions of the show. In 2008, it was announced that Véronique Cloutier and Louis Morissette would take over the program for its 2008 edition. However, this edition provoked controversy over certain sketches that viewers found to be derogatory and racist; such as a sketch about the assassination of then-American president-elect Barack Obama, and a sketch making fun of anglophones. The network received 1,300 complaints from viewers about the content in the special,Quebec New Year's special draws complaints of racism on CBC.ca, January 6, 2009.https://calgaryherald.com/news/Endless+complaints+about+year+show/1156458/story.html which led to Cloutier making a public apology stating that the sketches were supposed to criticize racism rather than promote it.Producers apologize for offensive skits in Quebec New Year's Eve special on CBC.ca, January 9, 2009. As a result of the controversy, a 2009 edition was not produced, but despite the controversy surrounding their edition, Cloutier and Morissette announced that they would return to produce a 2010 edition of Bye Bye. In 2018, the special began to achieve record viewership, with that year's edition overtaking an episode of La Petite Vie as the highest-rated Quebecois television program of all-time—with 4.471 million viewers. In 2020, due to restrictions on gatherings due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Quebec, Bye Bye 2020 (which featured several sketches lampooning the provincial and federal government's responses) achieved a record 3.8 million live viewers—a 93% market share. The 2021 special—which included a cameo appearance by recently- fired Montreal Canadiens manager Marc Bergevin in a parody of Uber Eats' commercials—once again broke records due to strict COVID-19 restrictions. With 4.862 million viewers, it was reported to be the highest-rated Quebecois television program of all-time (and in turn, among the top television broadcasts nationwide of 2021). The only other program among the top five is the aforementioned La Petite Vie. == See also == * List of Quebec television series * Culture of Quebec * Royal Canadian Air Farce, who presented a similar comedy special for CBC Television * Scotch and Wry, a similar Scottish series == References == == External links == * Le Bye Bye at the Radio-Canada Web site * RBO dit oui au Bye Bye 2007 (from Le Soleil, RBO says yes to Bye Bye 2007) Category:Television shows filmed in Quebec Category:1968 Canadian television series debuts Category:1998 Canadian television series endings Category:2006 Canadian television series debuts Category:1960s Canadian sketch comedy television series Category:1970s Canadian sketch comedy television series Category:1980s Canadian sketch comedy television series Category:1990s Canadian sketch comedy television series Category:2000s Canadian sketch comedy television series Category:Canadian television specials Category:Ici Radio- Canada Télé original programming Category:New Year's television specials Category:Annual television shows Category:New Year in Canada",
