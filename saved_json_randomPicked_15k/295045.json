 "text": "The Bok Prize is awarded annually by the Astronomical Society of Australia and the Australian Academy of Science to recognise outstanding research in astronomy by honoring a student at an Australian university. The prize consists of the Bok Medal together with an award of $1000 and ASA membership for the following year. ==History== The prize is named to commemorate the energetic work of Bart Bok in promoting the undergraduate and graduate study of astronomy in Australia, during his term (1957â€“1966) as Director of the Mount Stromlo Observatory. ==Past winners== Source: Astronomical Society of Australia {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
