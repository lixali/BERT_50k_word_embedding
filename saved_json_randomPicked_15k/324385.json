 "text": "Samuel Eliot Morison (July 9, 1887 – May 15, 1976) was an American historian noted for his works of maritime history and American history that were both authoritative and popular. He received his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1912, and taught history at the university for 40 years. He won Pulitzer Prizes for Admiral of the Ocean Sea (1942), a biography of Christopher Columbus, and John Paul Jones: A Sailor's Biography (1959). In 1942, he was commissioned to write a history of United States naval operations in World War II, which was published in 15 volumes between 1947 and 1962. Morison wrote the popular Oxford History of the American People (1965), and co-authored the classic textbook The Growth of the American Republic (1930) with Henry Steele Commager. Over the course of his career, Morison received eleven honorary doctoral degrees, and garnered numerous literary prizes, military honors, and national awards from both foreign countries and the United States, including two Pulitzer Prizes, two Bancroft Prizes, the Balzan Prize, the Legion of Merit, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. ==Early life (1887–1912)== Samuel Eliot Morison was born July 9, 1887, in Boston, Massachusetts, to John Holmes Morison (1856–1911) and Emily Marshall (Eliot) Morison (1857–1925). He was named for his maternal grandfather Samuel Eliot—a historian, educator, and public-minded citizen of Boston and Hartford, Connecticut. The Eliot family, which produced generations of prominent American intellectuals, descended from Andrew Eliot, who moved to Boston in the 1660s from the English village of East Coker. The most famous of this Andrew Eliot's direct descendants was poet T.S. Eliot, who titled the second of his Four Quartets \"East Coker\". Morison attended Noble and Greenough School (1897–1901) and St. Paul's (1901–1903) prior to entering Harvard University, where he was a member of the Phoenix S K Club. At the age of fourteen, he learned to sail, and soon after learned horsemanship—both skills would serve him well in his later historical writings.Washburn, Wilcomb E. \"Samuel Eliot Morison, Historian\" in The William and Mary Quarterly July 1979, pp. 325–352. He earned both a Bachelor of Arts and Master's degree from Harvard in 1908. After studying at the École Libre des Sciences Politiques (1908–1909), Morison returned to Harvard. ==Scholar and historian (1913–1941)== Morison originally intended to major in mathematics until Albert Bushnell Hart talked him into researching some papers of an ancestor stored in his wine cellar. His Harvard dissertation was the basis for his first book The Life and Letters of Harrison Gray Otis, Federalist, 1765–1848 (1913), which sold 700 copies. After earning his Ph.D. at Harvard, Morison became an instructor in history at the University of California, Berkeley in 1912. In 1915 he returned to Harvard and took a position as an instructor. During World War I he served as a private in the US Army. He also served as the American Delegate on the Baltic Commission of the Paris Peace Conference until June 17, 1919. In 1922–1925 Morison taught at Oxford University as the first Harmsworth Professor of American History.http://www.rai.ox.ac.uk/history/HarmsworthLectures In 1925 he returned to Harvard, where he was appointed a full professor. One of several subjects that fascinated Morison was the history of New England. As early as 1921 he published The Maritime History of Massachusetts, 1783–1860. In the 1930s Morison published a series of books on the history of Harvard University and New England, including Builders of the Bay Colony: A Gallery of Our Intellectual Ancestors (1930), The Founding of Harvard College (1935), Harvard College in the Seventeenth Century (1936), Three Centuries of Harvard: 1636–1936 (1936), and The Puritan Pronaos (1936). In later years, he returned to the subject of New England history, writing The Ropemakers of Plymouth (1950) and The Story of the 'Old Colony' of New Plymouth (1956) and editing the definitive work, Of Plymouth Plantation, 1620–1647 (1952). During his time at Harvard, Morison became the last professor to arrive on campus on horseback.Harvard Gazette http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/12/scholars-venerable/ He was chosen to speak at the 300th Anniversary celebration of Harvard in 1936 and a recording of his speech is included as part of the \"Harvard Voices\" collection.Harvard Voices Collection https://soundcloud.com/#harvard/samuel- eliot-morison-1936?in=harvard/sets/harvard-voices In 1938 Morison was elected as an honorary member of the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati. In 1940, Morison published Portuguese Voyages to America in the Fifteenth Century, a book that presaged his succeeding publications on the explorer, Christopher Columbus. In 1941, Morison was named Jonathan Trumbull Professor of American History at Harvard. For Admiral of the Ocean Sea (1942), Morison combined his personal interest in sailing with his scholarship by actually sailing to the various places that Columbus explored. The Harvard Columbus Expedition, led by Morison and including his wife and Captain John W. McElroy, Herbert F. Hossmer, Jr., Richard S. Colley, Dr. Clifton W. Anderson, Kenneth R. Spear and Richard Spear, left on 28 August 1939 aboard the 147 foot ketch Capitana for the Azores and Lisbon, Portugal from which they sailed on the 45 foot ketch Mary Otis to retrace Columbus' route using manuscripts and records of his voyages reaching Trinidad by way of Cadiz, Madeira, and the Canary Islands. After following the coast of South and Central America the expedition returned to Trinidad on 15 December 1939. The expedition returned to New York on 2 February 1940 aboard the United Fruit liner . The book was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1943. ==Naval war service (1942–1952)== In 1942, Morison met with his friend President Franklin D. Roosevelt and offered to write a history of United States Navy operations during the war from an insider's perspective by taking part in operations and documenting them. The President and Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox agreed to the proposal. On May 5, 1942, Morison was commissioned a lieutenant commander in the US Naval Reserve, and was called at once to active duty. Gregory Pfitzer explained his procedures: Morison worked with a team of researchers to prepare the History of United States Naval Operations in World War II, published in 15 volumes between 1947 and 1962, documenting everything from strategy and tactics to technology and the exploits of individuals. British military historian Sir John Keegan called it the best to come out of that conflict. Issued as The Rising Sun in the Pacific in 1948, Volume 3 won the Bancroft Prize in 1949. Morison was promoted to the rank of captain on December 15, 1945. On August 1, 1951, he was transferred to the Honorary Retired List of the Naval Reserve and was promoted to rear admiral on the basis of combat awards. In History as a Literary Art: An Appeal to Young Historians (1946), Morison argued that vivid writing springs from the synergy of experience and research: ==Later years (1953–1976)== In 1955, Morison retired from Harvard University. He devoted the rest of his life to writing. In quick succession, Morison wrote Christopher Columbus, Mariner (1955), Freedom in Contemporary Society (1956), The Story of the 'Old Colony' of New Plymouth, 1620–1692 (1956), Nathaniel Holmes Morison (1957), William Hickling Prescott (1958), Strategy and Compromise (1958), and John Paul Jones: A Sailor's Biography (1959), which earned Morison his second Pulitzer Prize. In the early 1960s, Morison's focus returned to his New England youth, writing The Story of Mount Desert Island, Maine (1960), One Boy's Boston, 1887–1901 (1962), Introduction to Whaler Out of New Bedford (1962), and A History of the Constitution of Massachusetts (1963). In 1963, The Two-Ocean War was published, a one-volume abridged history of the United States Navy in World War II. In 1964, Morison received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Lyndon B. Johnson. In presenting the distinguished historian with the highest civilian award in the United States, Johnson noted: Morison's later years were devoted to books on exploration, such as The Caribbean as Columbus Saw It, written jointly with Mauricio Obregón (1964), Spring Tides (1965), The European Discovery of America (1971–1974), and Samuel de Champlain: Father of New France (1972). His research for the latter book included sailing many of the routes taken by Champlain, and tracing others by airplane. Morison's first marriage to Elizabeth S. Greene produced four children—one of whom, Emily Morison Beck, became editor of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations. Elizabeth died August 20, 1945. In 1949, Morison married Baltimore widow Priscilla Barton. Priscilla died February 22, 1973. ==Death and legacy== Morison died of a stroke on May 15, 1976. His ashes are buried at Forest Hill Cemetery in Northeast Harbor, Maine. During his life Morison had received two Pulitzer Prizes, two Bancroft Prizes, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences' Emerson-Thoreau Medal (1961), and numerous honorary degrees, military awards, and honors from foreign nations. On July 19, 1979, the frigate USS Samuel Eliot Morison was launched, honoring Morison and his contributions to the United States Navy. Morison's legacy is also sustained by the United States Naval History and Heritage Command's Samuel Eliot Morison Naval History Scholarship. Boston's Commonwealth Avenue Mall features a bronze statue depicting Morison in sailor's oilskin. Morison's last known public appearance was on April 8, 1976, when he served as the ribbon cutter to open the USS Constitution Museum. \"The Museum's research library and an annual award given by the Museum for scholarship in history are both named in his honor.\"USS Constitution Museum Samuel Eliot Morison Page http://www.ussconstitutionmuseum.org/about-us/mission-and-history/samuel- eliot-morison/ The museum gives the annual Samuel Eliot Morison Award to a person whose public service has enhanced the image of the USS Constitution, and who reflects the best of Samuel Eliot Morison: artful scholarship, patriotic pride, and eclectic interest in the sea and things maritime. In 1976, the American Heritage magazine initiated an award named in honor of Morison called the Samuel Eliot Morison Award, honoring an American author whose work shows \"that good history is literature as well as high scholarship.\" It lasted two years. Since 1982, the Naval Order of the United States gives an honor in Morison's name, the Samuel Eliot Morison Award for Naval Literature, for significant works about the US Navy. In 1985, the Society for Military History established the Samuel Eliot Morison Prize, recognizing an author's body of contributions in the field of military history. ==Criticism== ===Slavery=== Morison was criticized by some African- American scholars for his treatment of American slavery in early editions of his book The Growth of the American Republic, which he co-wrote with Henry Steele Commager and later with Commager's student William E. Leuchtenburg. The book originated as Morison's two-volume Oxford History of the United States (Oxford University Press, 1927). First published in 1930, the first two editions of the textbook, according to these critics, echoed the thesis of American Negro Slavery (1918) by Ulrich Bonnell Phillips. This view, sometimes called the Phillips school of slavery historiography, was considered an authoritative interpretation of the history of American slavery during the first half of the twentieth century,Revisiting Blassingame's The Slave Community: The Scholars Respond. Ed. Al-Tony Gilmore. Westport: Greenwood Press, 1978, pp x–xi, . despite the intense criticism by some African-American scholars for its alleged racist underpinnings. Phillips's theories remained authoritative, considered by many white scholars to be ground-breaking and progressive when first proposed. In 1944, the NAACP began its criticism of The Growth of the American Republic.Jumonville, Neil. Henry Steele Commager: Midcentury Liberalism and the History of the Present. The University of North Carolina Press, 1999, p. 147. In 1950, despite denying any racist intent (he noted his daughter's marriage to the son of Joel Elias Spingarn, the second president of the NAACP), Morison reluctantly agreed to most of the demanded changes.Jumonville, Henry Steele Commager: Midcentury Liberalism and the History of the Present. 1999, p. 147. Morison refused to eliminate references to slaves who were loyal and devoted to their masters because they were treated well and to some positive \"civilizing\" effects of the American system of slavery. Morison also refused to remove references to stereotypes of African Americans that he believed were vital in accurately depicting the racist nature of American culture in the 19th and the early 20th centuries, an era during which even the most enlightened progressive thinkers routinely explained many aspects of human behavior as a result of innate racial or ethnic characteristics. In the 1962 edition of the textbook, Morison removed additional content that his critics had found to be offensive. ===Battle of Savo Island=== In his semi-official account of the Battle of Savo Island, a disastrous defeat for the US Navy during World War II, Morison partly blamed the defeat on the failure of an Australian aircrew to inform the Americans of the approaching Japanese forces. Morison appears to have based that story on inaccurate information that has since been refuted. On October 21, 2014, the US Navy issued a letter of apology to the last surviving member of the RAAF Hudson crew, which had sighted and duly reported the approach of the Japanese Naval Task Force. The letter states that \"RAdm. Morison's criticism was unwarranted.\" ==Honors and awards== Award ribbons {| style=\"margin:1em auto; text-align:center;\" | | | |- | | | |- | | | |- | | | |- |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto; text-align:center;\" |- !1st Row |colspan=\"3\"|Legion of Merit with \"V\" device |colspan=\"3\"|Navy Unit Commendation |colspan=\"3\"|Presidential Medal of Freedom (1964) |- !2nd Row |colspan=\"3\"|World War I Victory Medal |colspan=\"3\"|American Campaign Medal |colspan=\"3\"|European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with battle star |- !3rd Row |colspan=\"3\"|Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with six battle stars |colspan=\"3\"|World War II Victory Medal |colspan=\"3\"|Officer, Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (1961) |- !4th Row |colspan=\"3\"|Commander, Order of the White Rose of Finland |colspan=\"3\"|Commander, Order of Isabella the Catholic (1963) |colspan=\"3\"|Philippine Liberation Medal |- |} Other honors * Honorary Member of the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati (1938) * Vuelo Panamericano Medal (Republic of Cuba) (1943) Honorary degrees *Trinity College, Hartford (1935) *Amherst College (1936) *Harvard University (1936) *Union College (1939) *Columbia University (1942) *Yale University (1949) *Williams College (1950) *University of Oxford (1951) *Bucknell University (1960) *Boston College (1961) *College of the Holy Cross (1962) Literary prizes * Loubat Prize (1938) for The Founding of Harvard College (1935) and Harvard College in the Seventeenth Century (1936) * Pulitzer Prize (1943) for Admiral of the Ocean Sea (1942) * Bancroft Prize (1949) for The Rising Sun in the Pacific (1948) * Pulitzer Prize (1960) for John Paul Jones: A Sailor's Biography (1959) * American Academy of Arts and Sciences Emerson-Thoreau Medal (1961) * American Academy of Arts and Letters Gold Medal (1962) * Balzan Prize (1962) for History of United States Naval Operations in World War II (1963) * Bancroft Prize (1972) for The European Discovery of America: The Northern Voyages (1971) ==Works== Books by Morison (alphabetical): * Admiral of the Ocean Sea. 2 vols.
