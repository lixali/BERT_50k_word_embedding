 "text": "The Taipei Times is the only printed daily English-language newspaper in Taiwan, and the third established there. Online competitors include the state- owned Focus Taiwan and Taiwan News; The China Post was formerly a competitor but today is mostly non-operational. Established on 15 June 1999, the Taipei Times is published by the Liberty Times Group, which also publishes a Chinese- language newspaper, the Liberty Times, Taiwan's biggest newspaper by circulation, with a proâ€“Taiwan independence editorial line. The data page is in Chinese and there are abstracts in both Chinese and English, but the document body is only in English. On 15 May 2017, The China Post was the Timess last English-language competitor to go out of print and the Taipei Times is consequently offered at most points of sale, hotels and libraries as the English-language option. It is a participant in Project Syndicate. ==See also== * * * Media of Taiwan ==References== == External links == * Category:1999 establishments in Taiwan Category:English-language newspapers published in Taiwan Category:Mass media in Taipei Category:Publications established in 1999 Category:Newspapers published in Taiwan",
