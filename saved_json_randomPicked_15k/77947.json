 "text": "Erytheia or Erythia () (\"the red one\"), part of Greek mythology, is one of the three Hesperides. The name was applied to the island close to the coast of southern Hispania, that was the site of the original Punic colony of Gadeira. Pliny's Natural History (4.36) records of the island of Gades: \"On the side which looks towards Spain, at about 100 paces distance, is another long island, three miles wide, on which the original city of Gades stood. By Ephorus and Philistides it is called Erythia, by Tim√¶us and Silenus Aphrodisias, and by the natives the Isle of Juno.\" The island was the seat of Geryon, who was overcome by Heracles. ==References== Category:Hesperides Category:Women of Ares Category:Women in Greek mythology Category:Characters in Greek mythology Category:Locations in Greek mythology",
