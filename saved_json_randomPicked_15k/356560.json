 "text": "The secretary of state for work and pensions, also referred to as the work and pensions secretary, is a secretary of state in the Government of the United Kingdom, with overall responsibility for the business of the Department for Work and Pensions. The incumbent is a member of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom, 13th in the ministerial ranking. The office holder works alongside the other Work and Pensions ministers. The corresponding shadow minister is the shadow secretary of state for work and pensions, and there is also currently a Shadow Secretary of State for Employment Rights and Protections and a Shadow Secretary of State for the Future of Work. The performance of the Secretary of State is also scrutinised by the Work and Pensions Select Committee. The incumbent is Thérèse Coffey, following her appointment by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in September 2019. ==Responsibilities== Corresponding to what is generally known as a labour minister in many other countries, the work and pensions secretary's remit includes: * Support people of working age * Oversight of employers and pensions * Providing support for disability * Support for families and children ==History== It was created on 8 June 2001 by the merger of the Employment division of the Department for Education and Employment and the Department of Social Security. The Ministry of Pensions was created in 1916 to handle the payment of war pensions to former members of the Armed Forces and their dependants. In 1944 a separate Ministry of National Insurance (titled the Ministry of Social Insurance until 17 November 1944) was formed; the two merged in 1953 as the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance. In 1966 the Ministry was renamed the Ministry of Social Security, but this was short-lived, as the Ministry merged with the Ministry of Health in 1968 to form the Department of Health and Social Security. Confusingly, the Secretary of State responsible for this Department was titled the Secretary of State for Social Services. The Department was de-merged in 1988, creating the separate Department of Health and Department of Social Security. ==Ministers and secretaries of state== Colour key (for political parties): {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=8 | ===Minister of Pensions (1916–53)=== |- !colspan=2 |Name !colspan=2 |Term of office !Length of term !Political party !colspan=2 |Prime Minister |- !style=\"background-color: \" | |George Nicoll Barnes |10 December 1916 |17 August 1917 | |width=115|Labour |rowspan=4 style=\"background-color: \" | |rowspan=4 |David Lloyd George |- !style=\"background-color: \" | |John Hodge |17 August 1917 |10 January 1919 | |Labour |- !style=\"background-color: \" | |Sir Laming Worthington-Evans, Bt |10 January 1919 |2 April 1920 | |Conservative |- !style=\"background-color: \" | |Ian Macpherson |2 April 1920 |19 October 1922 | |Liberal |- !rowspan=2 style=\"background-color: \" | |rowspan=2 |George Tryon |rowspan=2 |31 October 1922 |rowspan=2 |22 January 1924 |rowspan=2 | |rowspan=2 |Conservative |rowspan=2 style=\"background-color: \" | |Bonar Law |- |Stanley Baldwin |- !style=\"background-color: \" | |Frederick Roberts |23 January 1924 |3 November 1924 | |Labour |style=\"background-color: \" | |Ramsay MacDonald |- !style=\"background-color: \" | |George Tryon |11 November 1924 |4 June 1929 | |Conservative |style=\"background-color: \" | |Stanley Baldwin |- !style=\"background-color: \" | |Frederick Roberts |7 June 1929 |24 August 1931 | |Labour |style=\"background-color: \" | |Ramsay MacDonald |- !style=\"background-color: \" | |George Tryon |3 September 1931 |18 June 1935 | |Conservative |style=\"background-color: \" | |Ramsay MacDonald |- !style=\"background-color: \" | |Robert Hudson |18 June 1935 |30 July 1936 | |Conservative |style=\"background-color: ;
