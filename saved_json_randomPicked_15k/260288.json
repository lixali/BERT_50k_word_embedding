 "text": "The Colombo Plan is a regional intergovernmental organization that began operations 1 July 1951. The organization was conceived at an international conference - The Commonwealth Conference on Foreign Affairs held in Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in January 1950, and attended by finance ministers of Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, Ceylon, Pakistan and New Zealand, and the Prime Ministers of Ceylon and India. Membership has expanded significantly over the years to the current 28 governments. The primary focus of its work is on the development of human resources in the region. Aid to education 1950 to 1983 came to $72 billion, of which $41 billion came from the United States.Lowe, 2010Auletta, 2000. == Host Country of The Colombo Plan == The Colombo Plan enjoys a host country agreement with the Government of Sri Lanka in the form of a MoU with privileges and immunities that are afforded by the Government of Sri Lanka. In a speech made in Colombo on 5 July 2010, the 4th Secretary-General Dato' Patricia Yoon-Moi Chia said: \"The gearing up of the level of our activities is made possible through the voluntary contributions of member countries and international agencies such as OPEC fund. Last year our programming was over US$10 million and we expect a more than US$12 million programming this year with almost another US$2 million in terms of cost- sharing from our member countries. With funding from the United States Government and 13 other member countries, the Colombo Plan is now the biggest stakeholder in drug demand reduction in the Asia-Pacific, with a special initiative in Afghanistan.\"Welcome speech by Dato' Patricia Yoon-Moi , Colombo, 5 July 2010. ==Programmes== The Colombo Plan has six permanent programmes: *Long-Term Scholarships Programme (LTSP, estd: 1951) *Drug Advisory Programme (DAP, estd: 1973) *Programme for Private Sector Development (PPSD, estd: 1995) *Programme for Public Administration & Environment (PPA, estd: 1995) *Gender Affairs Programme (GAP, estd: 2014) *Programme for Environment & Climate Change (ECC, estd: 2016) ==The Plan Now== Over the years, while adhering to the concept of human resource development and South- South Cooperation in addressing issues of economic and social development, the programme content of the Colombo Plan has been changing to take account of the needs of member countries in a fast changing world economic environment. In the early years, the training programmes were more of a long-term nature, while recent programmes have been focusing on providing advance skills and experience sharing aimed at arriving at the best practices in different fields of economic and social activities as a means of good policy making and governance. The current programmes of the Colombo Plan are in the areas of public policy formulation in an environment of globalisation and market economy, private sector development as a prime mover for growth, drug use and dependence prevention and treatment in member countries and addressing gender issues. The Colombo Plan Staff College for Technician Education located in Manila also provides skill development opportunities for technicians in middle level. In her 2010 speech, Dato' Patricia Yoon-Moi Chia states: \"The current Colombo Plan looks very different since our restructuring and revitalisation in 1995. As we continue to build upon our past successes, the new Colombo Plan uses cooperation among developing member countries or South-south Cooperation between the developed member countries and developing member countries, to underpin all our activities. Since our restructuring in 1995, we have now provided 16,082 scholarships to 23 member countries for both long-term and short-term training programmes.\" ==Past Secretaries-General== The Colombo Plan underwent an organisational transformation and renewal in 1995, and the Colombo Plan Bureau became the Colombo Plan Secretariat to be headed by the Secretary-General, instead of a Director.

Some Asians see in it only the hand of British imperialism, especially as it is not aimed at developing national self-sufficiency. It offers an almost exclusively economic solution for problems which are also political and social. Dangerous issues such as landlordism and the organisation of labour, which invite Communist exploitation, are barely touched on, doubtless because it seemed politically inexpedient to raise such questions.Blackton, Charles S., The Colombo Plan, Far Eastern Survey, 7 February 1951. ==Present members== The Colombo Plan currently has 27 members. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
