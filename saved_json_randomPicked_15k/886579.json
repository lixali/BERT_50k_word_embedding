Longoria is the Castillanized form of this Asturian-language surname. In 1767, her seventh great-grandfather received almost of land along the Rio Grande in a land grant from King Charles III of Spain. The family retained this land for more than a century. After the US-Mexican border was moved southwards in the aftermath of the Mexican–American War, the land ended up on the American side of the border.

Her ancestors include many other Maya on both sides of her family. Longoria identifies as a \"Texican\"—a Mexican-American Texan. ==Filmography== ===Films=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
