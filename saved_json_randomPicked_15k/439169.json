She came to national attention with the speech she gave at her father’s funeral, and since then has published her first book. ==Birth and baptism== Maud Angelica Behn was born on 29 April 2003 at Rikshospitalet University Hospital in Oslo, Norway, where her mother had also been born.\"Her Highness Princess Märtha Louise\" royalcourt.no, accessed 14 February 2022 Her great-great grandmother was Maud of Wales, youngest daughter of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom.L. A. Dahlmann, \"The secret journey of Queen Maud's coffin\", norwegianhistory.no, at archive.org, accessed 14 February 2022 Maud was christened at Slottskapellet, Royal Palace, Oslo, Norway on 2 July 2003, the one-hundredth birthday of her great-grandfather, King Olav V of Norway. Her godparents are her grandfather King Harald V, her uncle Crown Prince Haakon, Princess Alexandra of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg, her aunt Anja Sabrina Bjørshol, her mother's cousin Marianne Ulrichsen, the actress Kåre Conradi and the politician Trond Giske.Camilla Flaatten, \"Nå skal hun døpes Hvem blir fadder til lille Emma Tallulah?\", Nettavisen, 12.11.08, accessed 14 February 2022 (in Norwegian) She has two younger sisters, Leah Isadora Behn, born on 8 April 2005, and Emma Tallulah Behn, born on 29 September 2008.Barry Turner, ed., The Statesman's Yearbook 2012: The Politics, Cultures and Economies of the World (Springer, 2012), p. 949 The web site of the Norwegian royal family names the members of the family as King Harald and Queen Sonja, Crown Prince Haakon, Crown Princess Mette-Marit, Princess Ingrid Alexandra, Prince Sverre Magnus, Princess Märtha Louise, her three daughters, and Princess Astrid.Caroline Hallemann, \"Get to Know the Norwegian Royal Family\", Town & Country at townandcountrymag.com, 5 April 2021\"The Royal Family\", royalcourt.no, accessed 13 February 2022: \"The members of the Norwegian Royal House are Their Majesties King Harald and Queen Sonja and Their Royal Highnesses Crown Prince Haakon, Crown Princess Mette-Marit and Princess Ingrid Alexandra. The members of the Royal Family are in addition the Crown Prince and Crown Princess’s other children, His Highness Prince Sverre Magnus and Mr Marius Borg Høiby; Her Highness Princess Märtha Louise, Miss Maud Angelica Behn, Miss Leah Isadora Behn, Miss Emma Tallulah Behn and Her Highness Princess Astrid, Mrs Ferner.\" ==Succession to the throne== Princess Märtha Louise is the first child of King Harald and Queen Sonja, and Maud Angelica is their eldest grandchild. In 1990, the Norwegian constitution was changed, introducing full cognatic primogeniture to the Norwegian throne, so that the eldest child, regardless of sex, comes first in the line of succession. However, this change was made without displacing Crown Prince Haakon, as it only affects those born after 1989. Women born between 1971 and 1989 (in practice, only Märtha Louise), were given succession rights, but primogeniture would not apply. This was controversial, and if it were to be reversed Maud Angelica would be likely to inherit the throne in due course. At present, she is fifth in the line of succession to the Norwegian throne. ==Education== The Behn family lived in Islington, London, then in New York, and finally in Lommedalen, a valley outside Oslo. In the autumn of 2009, Maud Angelica Behn was enrolled at the Bærum Waldorf School (), an independent Steiner school in Bærum, a suburb west of Oslo. ==Family break-up== On 5 August 2016, Maud Angelica’s parents began divorce proceedings, which were finalized in 2017. Ari Behn killed himself on Christmas Day, 2019, and was buried in Oslo Cathedral. Maud Angelica made a speech at her father’s funeral and later talked about his death.Oskar Aanmoen, Princess Martha Louise’s daughter talks about impact of Ari Behn’s death, royalcentral.co.uk, 18 June 2020 In an article devoted to the speech, Aftenposten commented \"It does not get more powerful than this\".
