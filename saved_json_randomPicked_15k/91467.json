Most of the oil and half the gas is produced at depths between 4500 and 6000 feet, from 15 oil reservoirs and 4 gas reservoirs in the Oligocene Frio Formation sandstones deposited during Marine regression, notably the \"5900 foot sand\", the \"5800 foot sand\", the \"5500 foot sand\" and the \"5200 foot sand\".Mills, H.G., 1970, Geology of Tom O'Connor Field, Refugio County, Texas, in Geology of Giant Petroleum Oil Fields, Halbouty, M.T., editor, Tulsa: American Association of Petroleum Geologists, pp. 292-293 and 295-296 Gas with some oil is found above these sandstones in the Oligocene Anahuac Formation, deposited in a Marine transgression, notably the \"4400 foot Greta sand\".Mills, H.G., 1970, Geology of Tom O'Connor Field, Refugio County, Texas, in Geology of Giant Petroleum Oil Fields, Halbouty, M.T., editor, Tulsa: American Association of Petroleum Geologists, pp. 292 and 294 and 296 Dry gas is found in the Miocene-Pliocene Fleming sandstones deposited during marine regression, notably the \"L-4 sand, which is overlain by 1400 feet of Pleistocene Lissie sandstones.Mills, H.G., 1970, Geology of Tom O'Connor Field, Refugio County, Texas, in Geology of Giant Petroleum Oil Fields, Halbouty, M.T., editor, Tulsa: American Association of Petroleum Geologists, pp. 295-296 ==Healthcare== Medical care is provided to the citizens of Refugio County through a county hospital, several rural health clinics, a wellness clinic, and a specialty clinic.
