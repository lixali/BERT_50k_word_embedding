Owned by Audacy, Inc., WZGC is the Atlanta affiliate for CBS Sports Radio; the flagship station for the Atlanta Falcons and Atlanta Hawks radio networks; and the radio home of Hugh Douglas and Randy McMichael. The WZGC studios are located at Colony Square in Midtown Atlanta, while the station transmitter is located in Atlanta's North Druid Hills neighborhood. In addition to a standard analog transmission, WZGC broadcasts over one HD Radio channel, and is available online via Audacy. ==History== The station signed on the air on September 1, 1955 as WGKA-FM. Owned by Glenkaren Associates, it was the FM counterpart of WGKA (1190 AM), with studios at 1140 Peachtree Street NE.Broadcasting Yearbook 1956 page 102 WGKA-FM was the first full-time FM classical music station in Atlanta. In 1971, the General Cinema Corporation acquired WGKA-AM-FM. Even though it was a movie theater chain, GCC wanted to branch out into broadcast media. The classical music remained on the AM station, while the FM station became WZGC (referring to the last two letters in General Cinema) in 1972.Broadcasting Yearbook 1972 page B-49 WZGC began as an album-oriented rock station, which switched to Top 40 in March 1973, calling itself \"Z-93.\" In the 1970s, many radios still only received AM signals. WQXI and WGST (920 AM) were the leading Top 40 stations in Atlanta, but as FM listening increased, WZGC gained an audience. The station was acquired by First Media Corporation in 1976.Broadcasting Yearbook 1978 page C-51 In the 1980s, the AM Top 40 stations switched to other formats, leaving WZGC as Atlanta's only contemporary hits station. Then, in 1986, WAPW (99.7 FM) debuted with its own popular Top 40 format, with WZGC's ratings declining as a result. The station switched to a rhythmic contemporary format during the summer of 1987, and then to classic rock on January 3, 1989, while retaining the \"Z-93\" moniker.Gerry Yandel, \"Z-93, Fox 97 Have Changed Their Tunes,\" The Atlanta Journal Constitution, January 6, 1989.Z93 Goes From CHR to Classic Rockhttp://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1989/RR-1989-01-06.pdf Infinity Broadcasting acquired WZGC in 1992;Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2003-2004 page D-114 Infinity was renamed CBS Radio in December 2005.thumb|left|Former logo The name change to \"Dave FM\" and format switch to adult album alternative came at 5 p.m. on July 21, 2004, following a stunt featuring all-Dave Matthews Band music.

The HD-2 subchannel carried an Americana format branded as \"Dave Roots.\" Throughout its run as \"Dave FM,\" the station maintained decent ratings, though it was never an overall winner. However, in the summer of 2011, the station saw a drop in its Arbitron ratings. At the same time, CBS had enjoyed success with several of its FM stations that had switched to all sports formats in Dallas, Boston, Detroit and Pittsburgh. Due to this, CBS announced in July 2012 that WZGC would flip to all sports in October.CBS to Launch FM Sports in AtlantaCBS Names Its Atlanta FM Sports Outlet Dave's final day of programming, which started on September 29 after a three-day radiothon for Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, consisted of the on-air staff hosting final shifts (including Steve Craig, Jill, Mara Davis, Charles, Yvonne Monet, Sully, Renee and Margot), as well as a \"Top 92 Songs of Dave FM\" countdown. Around 12:20 a.m. on September 30, Dave FM ended regular programming with \"Little Lion Man\" by Mumford & Sons (the #1 song in the countdown) and \"Atlanta\" by Butch Walker. The station ran on automation until the flip at 2 p.m. on October 24. The final song on \"Dave\" was \"Thank You Friends\" by Big Star.92.9 The Game Atlanta DebutsDave Becomes 92.9 The Game Even though WZGC was owned by CBS Radio, it didn't affiliate with CBS Sports Radio at launch, as the network already had an affiliate in Atlanta on WCNN. Because of this, WZGC had local sports hosts around the clock, all week long. Eventually, WCNN became an ESPN Radio affiliate, and WZGC added CBS Sports Radio programming to its overnight schedule.
