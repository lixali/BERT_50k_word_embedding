It was formed in 1995 through the merger of the Beijing Agricultural University and the Beijing Agricultural Engineering University, which evolved from one of the earliest agriculture institutions in China founded in 1905 (京师大学堂). As of December 2019, CAU offers 66 undergraduate majors and over 32 masters and 21 doctoral programs. There are around 12,000 undergraduate and 8,900 graduate students. Among them, 508 students are international. Its gymnasium hosted the wrestling events during the 2008 Summer Olympics. CAU is a Chinese Ministry of Education Class A Double First Class University, and is designated as part of both Project 985, to create world class universities in China, and Project 211, to raise the research standards of universities. The China Agricultural University is widely regarded as one of the world's top agricultural research institutions. As of 2021, the \"Agricultural Science\" program is ranked 2nd worldwide by the Shanghai Ranking and the U.S. News Rankings. ==History== The history of China Agricultural University can be traced back to 1905 when the College of Agriculture was founded in the former Imperial University of Peking. Beijing Agricultural University (BAU) was established in September 1949 through the merging of Peking University's College of Agriculture, Tsinghua University's College of Agriculture and North China University's College of Agriculture. BAU was listed by the State Council as one of the Top-Six Key National Universities as well as one of the Top-Ten Key Universities for further construction and improvement. In October 1952, BAU's Department of Agricultural Machinery, North China College of Agricultural Machinery and Ministry of Agriculture's Central Agricultural Mechanization School merged to form the Beijing Mechanized Agricultural College, which was renamed Beijing Agricultural Mechanization Institute (BAMI) in July 1953. The BAMI was listed by the State Council in October 1960 as one of the 64 Key National Universities and then renamed again as Beijing Agricultural Engineering University (BAEU) in 1985. In 1995, Beijing Agricultural University and Beijing Agricultural Engineering University merged as China Agricultural University (CAU). Since then, the university became the top academic institution in China in terms of agricultural studies. ==Faculties and colleges== *College of Agronomy *College of Horticulture *College of Plant Protection *College of Biological Sciences *College of Animal Science and Technology *College of Veterinary Medicine *College of Food Science and Nutritional Engineering *College of Resources and Environmental Sciences *College of Information and Electrical Engineering *College of Engineering *College of Water Conservancy and Civil Engineering *College of Science *College of Economics and Management *College of Humanities and Development *International College at Beijing *School of Continuing Education *Department of Arts Education and Physical Education *Department of Ideological Education *Yantai Academy of China Agricultural University (Yantai Campus) *Beijing Construction University ==China Agricultural University Library== thumb|Library of CAU China Agricultural University Library consists of two parts, east library (No.17 Qinghua Dong Lu) and west library (No.2 Yuanmingyuan Xi Lu) occupying 21,665 square meters and hosting 2774 reading seats.
