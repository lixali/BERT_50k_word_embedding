In condensed matter physics, Bloch's theorem states that solutions to the Schrödinger equation in a periodic potential take the form of a plane wave modulated by a periodic function. Mathematically, they are written: u(\\mathbf{r}) |cellpadding |border |border colour = rgb(80,200,120) |background colour = rgb(80,200,120,10%)}} where \\mathbf{r} is position, \\psi is the wave function, u is a periodic function with the same periodicity as the crystal, the wave vector \\mathbf{k} is the crystal momentum vector, \\mathrm{e} is Euler's number, and \\mathrm{i} is the imaginary unit. Functions of this form are known as Bloch functions or Bloch states, and serve as a suitable basis for the wave functions or states of electrons in crystalline solids. Named after Swiss physicist Felix Bloch, the description of electrons in terms of Bloch functions, termed Bloch electrons (or less often Bloch Waves), underlies the concept of electronic band structures. These eigenstates are written with subscripts as \\psi_{n\\mathbf{k}}, where n is a discrete index, called the band index, which is present because there are many different wave functions with the same \\mathbf{k} (each has a different periodic component u). Within a band (i.e., for fixed n), \\psi_{n\\mathbf{k}} varies continuously with \\mathbf{k}, as does its energy. Also, \\psi_{n\\mathbf{k}} is unique only up to a constant reciprocal lattice vector \\mathbf{K}, or, \\psi_{n\\mathbf{k}}=\\psi_{n(\\mathbf{k+K})}. Therefore, the wave vector \\mathbf{k} can be restricted to the first Brillouin zone of the reciprocal lattice without loss of generality. ==Applications and consequences== ===Applicability=== The most common example of Bloch's theorem is describing electrons in a crystal, especially in characterizing the crystal's electronic properties, such as electronic band structure. However, a Bloch-wave description applies more generally to any wave-like phenomenon in a periodic medium. For example, a periodic dielectric structure in electromagnetism leads to photonic crystals, and a periodic acoustic medium leads to phononic crystals. It is generally treated in the various forms of the dynamical theory of diffraction. === Wave vector === Suppose an electron is in a Bloch state :\\psi ( \\mathbf{r} ) = \\mathrm{e}^{ \\mathrm{i} \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r} } u ( \\mathbf{r} ) , where u is periodic with the same periodicity as the crystal lattice. The actual quantum state of the electron is entirely determined by \\psi, not k or u directly. This is important because k and u are not unique. Specifically, if \\psi can be written as above using k, it can also be written using (k + K), where K is any reciprocal lattice vector (see figure at right). Therefore, wave vectors that differ by a reciprocal lattice vector are equivalent, in the sense that they characterize the same set of Bloch states. The first Brillouin zone is a restricted set of values of k with the property that no two of them are equivalent, yet every possible k is equivalent to one (and only one) vector in the first Brillouin zone. Therefore, if we restrict k to the first Brillouin zone, then every Bloch state has a unique k. Therefore, the first Brillouin zone is often used to depict all of the Bloch states without redundancy, for example in a band structure, and it is used for the same reason in many calculations. When k is multiplied by the reduced Planck's constant, it equals the electron's crystal momentum. Related to this, the group velocity of an electron can be calculated based on how the energy of a Bloch state varies with k; for more details see crystal momentum. ===Detailed example=== For a detailed example in which the consequences of Bloch's theorem are worked out in a specific situation, see the article: Particle in a one-dimensional lattice (periodic potential). == Bloch's theorem == Bloch's theorem is as follows: u(\\mathbf{r}) where u has the same periodicity as the atomic structure of the crystal. : u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{x}) = u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}) }} === Proof of theorem === :{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"80%\" style=\"text-align:left\" !Proof with lattice periodicity |- | ==== Preliminaries: Crystal symmetries, lattice, and reciprocal lattice ==== The defining property of a crystal is translational symmetry, which means that if the crystal is shifted an appropriate amount, it winds up with all its atoms in the same places. (A finite-size crystal cannot have perfect translational symmetry, but it is a useful approximation.) A three-dimensional crystal has three primitive lattice vectors a1, a2, a3. If the crystal is shifted by any of these three vectors, or a combination of them of the form :n_1 \\mathbf{a}_1 + n_2 \\mathbf{a}_2 + n_3 \\mathbf{a}_3 where ni are three integers, then the atoms end up in the same set of locations as they started. Another helpful ingredient in the proof is the reciprocal lattice vectors. These are three vectors b1, b2, b3 (with units of inverse length), with the property that ai · bi = 2π, but ai · bj = 0 when i ≠ j. (For the formula for bi, see reciprocal lattice vector.) ====Lemma about translation operators==== Let \\hat{T}_{n_1,n_2,n_3} \\\\! denote a translation operator that shifts every wave function by the amount (as above, nj are integers). The following fact is helpful for the proof of Bloch's theorem: ::Lemma: If a wave function \\psi is an eigenstate of all of the translation operators (simultaneously), then \\psi is a Bloch state. Proof: Assume that we have a wave function \\psi which is an eigenstate of all the translation operators. As a special case of this, :\\psi(\\mathbf{r}+\\mathbf{a}_j) = C_j \\psi(\\mathbf{r}) for j = 1, 2, 3, where Cj are three numbers (the eigenvalues) which do not depend on r. It is helpful to write the numbers Cj in a different form, by choosing three numbers θ1, θ2, θ3 with : :\\psi(\\mathbf{r}+\\mathbf{a}_j) = \\mathrm{e}^{2 \\pi \\mathrm{i} \\theta_j} \\psi(\\mathbf{r}) Again, the θj are three numbers which do not depend on r. Define , where bj are the reciprocal lattice vectors (see above). Finally, define :u(\\mathbf{r}) = \\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i} \\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}} \\psi(\\mathbf{r})\\,. Then : u(\\mathbf{r} + \\mathbf{a}_j) = \\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i}\\mathbf{k} \\cdot (\\mathbf{r} + \\mathbf{a}_j)} \\psi(\\mathbf{r}+\\mathbf{a}_j) = \\big( \\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i}\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}} \\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i}\\mathbf{k}\\cdot \\mathbf{a}_j} \\big) \\big( \\mathrm{e}^{2\\pi \\mathrm{i} \\theta_j} \\psi(\\mathbf{r}) \\big) = \\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i}\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}} \\mathrm{e}^{-2\\pi \\mathrm{i} \\theta_j} \\mathrm{e}^{2\\pi \\mathrm{i} \\theta_j} \\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = u(\\mathbf{r}). This proves that u has the periodicity of the lattice. Since \\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} \\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}} u(\\mathbf{r}), that proves that the state is a Bloch state. ====Proof==== Finally, we are ready for the main proof of Bloch's theorem which is as follows. As above, let \\hat{T}_{n_1,n_2,n_3} \\\\! denote a translation operator that shifts every wave function by the amount , where ni are integers. Because the crystal has translational symmetry, this operator commutes with the Hamiltonian operator. Moreover, every such translation operator commutes with every other. Therefore, there is a simultaneous eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian operator and every possible \\hat{T}_{n_1,n_2,n_3} \\\\! operator. This basis is what we are looking for. The wave functions in this basis are energy eigenstates (because they are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian), and they are also Bloch states (because they are eigenstates of the translation operators; see Lemma above). |} === Another proof === :{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"80%\" style=\"text-align:left\" !Proof with operators |- | We define the translation operator : \\hat{\\mathbf{T}}_{\\mathbf{n}}\\psi(\\mathbf{r})= \\psi(\\mathbf{r}+\\mathbf{T}_{\\mathbf{n}})= \\psi(\\mathbf{r}+n_1\\mathbf{a}_1+n_2\\mathbf{a}_2+n_3\\mathbf{a}_3)= \\psi(\\mathbf{r}+\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}) We use the hypothesis of a mean periodic potential : U(\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{T}_{\\mathbf{n}})= U(\\mathbf{x}) and the independent electron approximation with an hamiltonian : \\hat{H}=\\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}^2}{2m}+U(\\mathbf{x}) Given the Hamiltonian is invariant for translations it shall commute with the translation operator : [\\hat{H},\\hat{\\mathbf{T}}_{\\mathbf{n}}] = 0 and the two operators shall have a common set of eigenfunctions.

Translations can be written in terms of unit vectors : \\vec{\\mathbf{\\tau}}=\\sum_{i=1}^3 n_i \\vec{\\mathbf{a}}_i We can think of these as commuting operators : \\hat{\\vec{\\mathbf{\\tau}}} = \\hat{\\vec{\\mathbf{\\tau}}}_1\\hat{\\vec{\\mathbf{\\tau}}}_2\\hat{\\vec{\\mathbf{\\tau}}}_3 where \\hat{\\vec{\\mathbf{\\tau}}}_i=n_i \\hat{\\vec{\\mathbf{a}}}_i The commutativity of the \\hat{\\vec{\\mathbf{\\tau}}}_i operators gives three commuting cyclic subgroups (given they can be generated by only one element) which are infinite, 1-dimensional and abelian. All irreducible representations of Abelian groups are one dimensional. Given they are one dimensional the matrix representation and the character are the same. The character is the representation over the complex numbers of the group or also the trace of the representation which in this case is a one dimensional matrix. All these subgroups, given they are cyclic, they have characters which are appropriate roots of unity. In fact they have one generator \\gamma which shall obey to \\gamma^n=1, and therefore the character \\chi(\\gamma)^n=1. Note that this is straightforward in the finite cyclic group case but in the countable infinite case of the infinite cyclic group (i.e. the translation group here) there is a limit for n \\to \\infty where the character remains finite. Given the character is a root of unity, for each subgroup the character can be then written as : \\chi_{k_1}(\\hat{\\vec{\\tau}}_1 (n_1,a_1))=e^{ik_1n_1a_1} If we introduce the Born–von Karman boundary condition on the potential: : V (\\mathbf {r} +\\sum N_{i}\\mathbf {a}_{i})= V (\\mathbf {r} +\\mathbf{L})=V (\\mathbf {r} ) Where L is a macroscopic periodicity in the direction \\vec{a} that can also be seen as a multiple of a_i where \\mathbf{L} = \\sum N_{i}\\mathbf {a}_{i} This substituting in the time independent Schrödinger equation with a simple effective Hamiltonian : \\hat{H}=-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} abla^2 + V(\\vec{r}) induces a periodicity with the wave function: : \\psi (\\mathbf {r} +\\sum N_{i}\\mathbf {a}_{i})=\\psi (\\mathbf {r} ) And for each dimension a translation operator with a period L : \\hat{P}_{\\varepsilon|\\tau_i + L_i} = \\hat{P}_{\\varepsilon|\\tau_i} From here we can see that also the character shall be invariant by a translation of L_i: : e^{i k_1 n_1 a_1} = e^{i k_1 ( n_1 a_1 + L_1)} and from the last equation we get for each dimension a periodic condition: : k_1 n_1 a_1 = k_1 ( n_1 a_1 + L_1) - 2 \\pi m_1 where m_1 \\in \\mathbb{Z} is an integer and k_1=\\frac {2 \\pi m_1}{L_1} The wave vector k_1 identify the irreducible representation in the same manner as m_1, and L_1 is a macroscopic periodic length of the crystal in direction a_1. In this context, the wave vector serves as a quantum number for the translation operator. We can generalize this for 3 dimensions \\chi_{k_1}(n_1,a_1)\\chi_{k_2}(n_2,a_2)\\chi_{k_3}(n_3,a_3) = e^{i\\vec{k} \\cdot \\vec{\\tau}} and the generic formula for the wave function becomes: : \\hat{P}_R\\psi_j = \\sum_{\\alpha} \\psi_{\\alpha} \\chi_{\\alpha j}(R) i.e. specializing it for a translation : \\hat{P}_{\\varepsilon|\\vec{\\tau}} \\psi(\\vec{\\mathbf{r}}) =\\psi(\\vec{\\mathbf{r}}) e^{i \\vec{k} \\cdot \\vec{\\tau}} = \\psi(\\vec{\\mathbf{r}}+ \\vec{\\mathbf{\\tau}}) and we have proven Bloch’s theorem. Apart from the group theory technicalities this proof is interesting because it becomes clear how to generalize the Bloch theorem for groups that are not only translations. This is typically done for Space groups which are a combination of a translation and a point group and it is used for computing the band structure, spectrum and specific heats of crystals given a specific crystal group symmetry like FCC or BCC and eventually an extra basis.The vibrational spectrum and specific heat of a face centered cubic crystal, Robert B. Leighton In this proof it is also possible to notice how is key that the extra point group is driven by a symmetry in the effective potential but it shall commute with the Hamiltonian. In the generalized version of the Bloch theorem, the Fourier transform, i.e. the wave function expansion, gets generalized from a discrete Fourier transform which is applicable only for cyclic groups and therefore translations into a character expansion of the wave function where the characters are given from the specific finite point group. Also here is possible to see how the characters (as the invariants of the irreducible representations) can be treated as the fundamental building blocks instead of the irreducible representations themselves.Group Representations and Harmonic Analysis from Euler to Langlands, Part II |} == Velocity and effective mass of Bloch electrons == If we apply the time- independent Schrödinger equation to the Bloch wave function we obtain : \\hat{H_{\\mathbf{k}}} u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\left[ \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\left( -i abla + \\mathbf{k} \\right)^2 + U(\\mathbf{r}) \\right] u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{r}) with boundary conditions : u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{r}) = u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{r} + \\mathbf{R}) Given this is defined in a finite volume we expect an infinite family of eigenvalues, here {\\mathbf{k}} is a parameter of the Hamiltonian and therefore we arrive to a \"continuous family\" of eigenvalues \\varepsilon_n(\\mathbf{k}) dependent on the continuous parameter {\\mathbf{k}} and therefore to the basic concept of an electronic band structure :{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"80%\" style=\"text-align:left\" !Proof |- | : [\\frac{- \\hbar^2}{2m} abla^2 + U(\\mathbf{x} ) ]\\left(e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} } u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{x})\\right) = E_{\\mathbf{k}} \\left(e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} } u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{x})\\right) We remain with : \\frac{- \\hbar^2}{2m} abla \\cdot \\left( i \\mathbf{k} e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} } u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{x}) + e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} } abla u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{x}) \\right) + U(\\mathbf{x}) e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} } u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{x}) = E_{\\mathbf{k}} e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} } u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{x}) : \\frac{- \\hbar^2}{2m} \\left( i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\left( i \\mathbf{k} e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} } u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{x}) + e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} } abla u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{x}) \\right) \\+ i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} } abla u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{x}) + e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} } abla^2 u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{x}) \\right) + U(\\mathbf{x}) e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} } u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{x}) = E_{\\mathbf{k}} e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} } u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{x}) : \\frac{ \\hbar^2}{2m} \\left( \\mathbf{k}^2 e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} } u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{x}) \\- 2i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} } abla u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{x}) - e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} } abla^2 u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{x}) \\right) + U(\\mathbf{x}) e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} } u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{x}) = E_{\\mathbf{k}} e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} } u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{x}) : \\frac{ \\hbar^2}{2m} \\left( -i abla + \\mathbf{k} \\right)^2 u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{x}) + U(\\mathbf{x}) u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{x}) = E_{\\mathbf{k}} u_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{x}) |} This shows how the effective momentum can be seen as composed by two parts : \\hat{\\mathbf{p}}_{eff} = \\left( -i \\hbar abla + \\hbar \\mathbf{k} \\right) A standard momentum -i \\hbar abla and a crystal momentum \\hbar \\mathbf{k}.

The same underlying mathematics, however, was also discovered independently several times: by George William Hill (1877), This work was initially published and distributed privately in 1877. Gaston Floquet (1883), and Alexander Lyapunov (1892). Translated by A. T. Fuller from Edouard Davaux's French translation (1907) of the original Russian dissertation (1892). As a result, a variety of nomenclatures are common: applied to ordinary differential equations, it is called Floquet theory (or occasionally the Lyapunov–Floquet theorem). The general form of a one-dimensional periodic potential equation is Hill's equation: ::\\frac {d^2y}{dt^2}+f(t) y=0, where f(t) is a periodic potential. Specific periodic one-dimensional equations include the Kronig–Penney model and Mathieu's equation. Mathematically Bloch's theorem is interpreted in terms of unitary characters of a lattice group, and is applied to spectral geometry.Kuchment, P.(1982), Floquet theory for partial differential equations, RUSS MATH SURV., 37,1-60 ==See also== * Bloch oscillations * Bloch wave – MoM method * Electronic band structure * Nearly free electron model * Periodic boundary conditions * Symmetries in quantum mechanics * Tight-binding model * Wannier function ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * * * Category:Quantum states Category:Condensed matter physics",
