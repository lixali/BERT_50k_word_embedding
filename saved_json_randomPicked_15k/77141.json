At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Denter and Paullus (or, less frequently, year 452 Ab urbe condita). The denomination 302 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. == Events == === By place === ==== Asia Minor ==== * Following their agreement to work together to defeat Antigonus, Seleucus invades Asia Minor from Babylonia, while Ptolemy attacks Syria and Lysimachus moves into the western part of Asia Minor. * Docimus, the regent of Phrygia, and Phoenix, the strategos of Lycia, desert Antigonus. * The Macedonian general, Philetaerus, moves his allegiance from Antigonus to Antigonus' rival, Lysimachus.
