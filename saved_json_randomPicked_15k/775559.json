 "text": "Lamberta (minor planet designation: 187 Lamberta) is a main-belt asteroid that was discovered by Corsican-born French astronomer Jérôme Eugène Coggia on April 11, 1878, and named after the astronomer Johann Heinrich Lambert. It was the second of Coggia's five asteroid discoveries. The spectrum matches a classification of a C-type asteroid, which may mean it has a composition of primitive carbonaceous materials. It is a dark object as indicated by the low albedo and has an estimated size of about 131 km. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Background asteroids Lamberta Lamberta Lamberta Category:C-type asteroids (Tholen) Category:Ch-type asteroids (SMASS) 18780411",
