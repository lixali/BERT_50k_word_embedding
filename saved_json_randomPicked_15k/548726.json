 "text": "No-Do is the colloquial name for Noticiario y Documentales, (\"News and Documentaries\"), a state-controlled series of cinema newsreels produced in Spain from 1943 to 1981 and closely associated with the 1939-1975 Francisco Franco's dictatorial regime. In their heyday, the No-Do newsreels predictably contained a good deal of propaganda and effervescent reporting in favour of the Francoist State. They were a way in which Franco could have a monopoly over the news and supply public information, censorship and propaganda for the formation of public opinion favorable to the Spanish State. The No-Do newsreels, tainted by their indelible association with the Francoist State, fell out of favour within a few years of Spain's transition to democratic government after Franco's death. The last No-Do was produced in 1981 prior to the operation's absorption into RTVE, Spain's state-controlled television and radio broadcaster. The No-Do archive is an important asset of RTVE and is often mined for nostalgia programmes. ==References== ==External links== * Category:RTVE Category:Film series introduced in 1943 Category:1981 disestablishments in Spain Category:Film organisations in Spain Category:Francoist Spain Category:Newsreels Category:Propaganda film units Category:State-owned film companies Category:Spanish films Category:1943 establishments in Spain",
