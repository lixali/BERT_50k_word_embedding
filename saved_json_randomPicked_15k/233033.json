It is defined as the volume of a cube with sides of 1 yard (3 feet, 36 inches, 0.9144 meters) in length. ==Symbols and abbreviations== The IEEE symbol for the cubic yard is yd³. The following abbreviations are used: *cubic yards, cubic yard, cubic yds, cubic yd *cu yards, cu yard, cu yds, cu yd, CYs *yards/-3, yard/-3, yds/-3, yd/-3 *yards^3, yard^3, yds^3, yd^3 *yards³, yard³, yds³ ===Cubic yard per second=== One cubic yard per second (1 yd3/s) is a unit of volume flow rate. It corresponds to one cubic yard passing through a specified area every second. ===Cubic yard per minute=== One cubic yard per minute (1 yd3/min) is a unit of volume flow rate. It corresponds to one cubic yard passing through a specified area every minute. * 1 yd3/s = 60 yd3/min ==Conversions== {| |- |valign=top rowspan=11|1 cubic yard |- |= 27 cubic feet |- |= cubic inches |- |= cubic metres |- |≈ cubic miles |- |≈ imperial bushels |- |≈ US bushels |- |≈ imperial gallons |- |≈ 201.974 US liquid gallons |- |≈ crude barrels |- |≈ 764.5549 litres |} ==See also== * cubic foot * cubic inch * Square yard * Orders of magnitude (volume) * Conversion of units * Cube (arithmetic), cube root ** Cubic equation, cubic function ==References== Category:Units of volume Category:Imperial units Category:Customary units of measurement in the United States ja:ヤード#立方ヤード",
