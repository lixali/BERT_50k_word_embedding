It is the former capital city of Malawi. It was the capital of first British Central Africa and then Nyasaland Protectorate before the establishment of Malawi in 1964. It was also the first capital of Malawi and remained so until 1974, when Lilongwe became the capital. The Parliament remained even longer, until 1994. The city is best known for its British colonial architecture and its location at the base of the dramatic Zomba Plateau. Zomba is also the home of Chancellor College of the University of Malawi. ==History== The town's British colonial past is reflected in the architecture of its older buildings and homes. Zomba was once a hub for expatriates in Malawi. Its diverse cultural mix included British tobacco farmers and Dutch, German and U.S. emissaries. The British also established Sir Harry Johnston Primary School. The Zomba Gymkhana Club was once the focus for social activity in the expatriate community. However, in recent years, the club's appearance and reputation have been in decline. The Zomba Gymkhana Club was where the Malawi Rock Shandy was created by the head barman Shadrack in the 1960s. Next to the old parliament building is the botanical garden, which was established by the British, as well as the golf course in the city centre. At the southern entrance to the city, the King's African Rifles memorial is positioned right next to the M1. During British rule, Zomba served as capital under British East Africa and later the Nyasaland Protectorate. It became capital of independent Malawi from 1964 to 1975. ==Economy== Zomba is the centre for the tobacco and dairy farms of the surrounding area, which also produces rice, corn (maize), fish, and softwoods. Timber is extracted from the nearby plateau. A market can be found in the town centre, where farmers from surrounding villages sell their products, as well as secondhand clothes and basic consumer goods. Also fresh and dried fish from Lake Malawi and Lake Chilwa are sold. Local supermarkets, such as Peoples Trading Company, Metro and Shoprite are located near the bus depot. A dozen, mainly Indian- and Chinese-owned, shops sell imported clothes, electrical appliances, bicycles and other basic goods. Along the M1, several filling stations can be found. National Bank of Malawi, NBS savings Bank, Standard Bank and Opportunity Bank International as well as the Malawian Post have branches in the city. Zomba Hospital is an important employer and one of the biggest hospitals in the country. Zomba Central Prison was built in 1935, and is the only maximum- security prison in Malawi. ===Tourism=== The main attraction in Zomba is the Zomba Plateau. Activities offered include rock climbing, horseback riding, birdwatching, fishing and mountain-biking. The Ku Chawe Inn, situated right on the edge of the plateau, is the most luxurious hotel in the area. Tourists also can sleep in log houses or camp at the trout farm. Within the town, two backpacker hostels and several lodges, ranging from basic to mid-class, are open for guests. A craft market provides locally made souvenirs. ==Education== thumb|left|Facade in Zomba ===University of Malawi=== Chancellor College, the largest of the constituent colleges of the University of Malawi, is located in Zomba.

The school is centrally located on Kalimbuka Road. It has students from a range of nationalities with around 80% of the students Malawian. The school is non-profit making and is managed by an elected board of trustees from the parent community. The school's swimming-pool is open to public from September to May each year. ===Zomba Catholic Secondary School=== Located around from the Old Capital city's town centre, this is a government-funded school founded in 1942 by the Catholic church. A community of Marist Brothers is located on site and the Brothers help with the teaching. Although funded by the government, pupils are still required to pay fees (MK107,000 per term as of 2017) as they live on campus and must pay board. The school is one of the best government schools in Malawi and competition for entry is intense. The school has around 600 pupils and 30 teachers as well as several administrative staff. It is also well known as Box 2 and BOCCO (Boys Of Courage And Cooperation). ===Zomba Theological College=== Zomba Theological College was founded in 1977 and is run by the five synods of Blantyre, Livingstonia, Nkhoma, Harare and Zambia but also works closely with the theological department of the University of Malawi.Zomba Theological College: Course and academic details ==Geography== The Zomba Plateau is Zomba's most famous feature.
