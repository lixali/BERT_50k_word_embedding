Gaddafi and contacting foreign authorities, after he talked to a US diplomat.\" Physicians for Human Rights reported at the time that he was receiving inadequate care for heart disease and diabetes. During her visit to Libya, the United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice pleaded for Eljahmi's release from solitary detention. Eljahmi remained imprisoned. Writing in Forbes in 2009, Fathi's brother Mohamed criticised the lack of support that Eljahmi had received from human rights organisations, stating that \"for nearly a year, both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch hesitated to advocate publicly for Fathi's case, because they feared their case workers might lose access to Libyan visas.\" Eljahmi died on 21 May 2009 in Amman, Jordan, where he had been evacuated for emergency medical treatment after falling into a coma in Libyan custody. ==References== ==External links== * Amnesty International report. * Dissident Watch: Fathi El-Jahmi, Middle East Quarterly, meet the man Mu'ammar al-Gadhafi doesn't want anyone to meet. * Free Fathi El Jahmi Petition * Weekly Update, Foundation for Defense of Democracies, Nov 9, 2004 Category:Libyan democracy activists Category:Libyan people who died in prison custody Category:Prisoners who died in Libyan detention Category:Deaths from sepsis Category:1941 births Category:2009 deaths",
