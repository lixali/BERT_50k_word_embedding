Instead, Kirchner and Wiel, analyzing fossil record data compiled by Jack Sepkoski, found that recovery time for catastrophic die-offs was about 10 million years regardless of the number of species lost. Kirchner has also been an active critic of the Gaia hypothesis. ==References== == External links == *Homepage; accessed 19 January 2007 Category:Living people Category:American ecologists Category:University of California, Berkeley faculty Category:Year of birth missing (living people)",
