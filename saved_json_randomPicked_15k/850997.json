 "text": "The Aerocar was an American automobile built from 1905 to 1908 in Detroit, Michigan. Backed by Henry Ford's former partner, coal merchant Alexander Malcomson, the short-lived company offered an air-cooled 24 hp (18 kW) four- cylinder luxury car which sold for $2800. The factory was sold to Hudson Motor Car Company. ==History== In 1906, the Model A was powered by a Reeves 24-horsepower, four-cylinder, air-cooled engine. It came with a \"Standard Extension Black Top\" and two gas headlights as well as \"Full Oil Lamp Equipment.\" The automobile had a Prest-o-Lite tank, Hartford shock absorbers, Gabriel horn and a speedometer. It also came with an extra tire and inner tube in a waterproof case with attaching irons, robe-rail and a footrest in Tonneau. A toolbox with full equipment was attached to the exterior running board. The machine cost $2,800. The air-cooled engine was later replaced by a Reeves water-cooled model. ==Advertisements== {| | thumb|upright|260px|The Aerocar Company - Detroit, Michigan - 1906 |} ==See also== *Brass Era car ==External links== *actress Frances Starr at the wheel of one of the company's luxury cars ==References== Category:Defunct motor vehicle manufacturers of the United States Category:Motor vehicle manufacturers based in Michigan Category:Brass Era vehicles Category:Cars introduced in 1905 Category:Hudson Motor Car Company Category:Defunct manufacturing companies based in Detroit",
