Originally named Long Cove, the locality extends northwards from Chinatown, along both sides of Cockle Bay to King Street Wharf on the east, and to the suburb of Pyrmont on the west. Cockle Bay is just one of the waterways that makes up Darling Harbour, which opens north into the much larger Port Jackson. The precinct and its immediate surroundings are administered independently of the local government area of the City of Sydney, by Property NSW. ==History== thumb|Darling Harbour in 1900 Darling Harbour is named after Lieutenant-General Ralph Darling, who was Governor of New South Wales from 1825 to 1831. The area was originally known as Long Cove, but was generally referred to as Cockle Bay until 1826 when Governor Darling renamed it after himself. The name Cockle Bay has recently been restored in reference to the headwaters of the harbour. It was originally part of the commercial port of Sydney, including the Darling Harbour Railway Goods Yard. During the Great Depression, the eastern part of Darling Harbour (Barangaroo) became known as The Hungry Mile, a reference to the waterside workers searching for jobs along the wharves. Much of the land had been the site of the NSW Railways central marshalling yards and freight consolidation centre. The Enquiry into the NSW industry, including rail/road competition (1978â€“80), under Commissioner Gavan McDonell, found that this centre was inefficient, should be moved, and the land used for other public purposes. These recommendations were acted upon and by the mid-to-late 1980s, when the area had become largely derelict it was redeveloped as a pedestrian and tourist precinct as an initiative of then New South Wales Minister for Public Works, Laurie Brereton. The Sydney Convention & Exhibition Centre at Darling Harbour was a venue of the 2000 Summer Olympic Games and a key meeting venue of APEC Australia 2007. center|thumb|520x520px|The southern end of Darling Harbour == Heritage listings == Darling Harbour has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Harbour Promenade: Darling Harbour Woodward Water Feature ==Attractions== thumb|The Harbourside Shopping Centre The Darling Harbour precinct is home to a number of major public facilities and attractions, including: thumb|Cockle Bay Wharf * Harbourside Shopping Centre, which includes Kingpin Bowling Alley (the only bowling alley in Darling Harbour), M9 Laser Skirmish, as well as Australia's first retail Jet flight simulator. * Cockle Bay Wharf (restaurants, bars and Home nightclub - one of Australia's largest nightclubs) *IMAX theater (reopening in the Ribbon development in 2021)thumb|The Ribbon * Paddy's Markets * Chinese Garden of Friendship * Tumbalong Park * Darling Quarter Playground and cafes * Australian National Maritime Museum (featuring museum ships including HMAS Vampire) * The Star Casino & Entertainment Complex * The Darling Hotel & Spa * Powerhouse Museum * Sydney Aquarium * Madame Tussauds * Sydney Wildlife World * Aboriginal Centre * International Convention Centre Sydney (ICC Sydney), opened in December 2016. ==Transport== Darling Harbour is accessible via various modes of public transport.
