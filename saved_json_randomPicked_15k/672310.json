With playground protection from the sun and sea breeze, Clarko beach side reserve near Trigg Island is one of the most popular parks in the City of Stirling. Clarko Reserve was created when beach shacks were demolished and shack owners were compensated with sub- divided blocks of residential land further east in the new Trigg suburb. ==History== The suburb and island was named after Henry Trigg, Superintendent of Public Works for the Swan River Colony in 1842. First time when land at Trigg was taken up, reaches back to 1877.
