Vermilion Parish is part of the Lafayette metropolitan statistical area, and located in southern Acadiana. At the 2010 U.S. census, the population was 57,999; the 2019 American Community Survey estimated its population was 59,865.

By historic times, the Chitimacha and Atakapa inhabited the area and were the American Indians encountered by Spanish and French explorers and settlers. The tribes' numbers were drastically reduced as a result of exposure to European diseases. French, Spanish, enslaved Africans, and French-Canadians from Acadia expelled after the Seven Years' War won by Great Britain, had all entered the area by the end of the 18th century. As the population became mostly Cajun, the primary language was French for years. In the mid- to late 19th century, they were joined by European Americans; immigrants from Italy, recruited to work on the plantations, as well as Jewish immigrants from Germany and eastern Europe, who tended to settle in towns and become merchants. ==Geography== thumb|350px|Timelapse of six years in southern Vermilion Parish, Louisiana (1973, 1980, 1986, 1992, 2003, 2010) land being overtaken by water.|left According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the parish has a total area of , of which is land and (24%) is water.
