The band recorded it in 1991 at Westbeach Recorders in Hollywood, California. Epitaph owner/founder Brett Gurewitz actually produced the album. However, constant disagreements with guitarist Fletcher over the album's production and his dislike of the sound of the album prompted him to have his name taken off the credits in the liner notes. ==Reception== Pennywise was released on October 22, 1991, and was the band's first album distributed via Epitaph Records. This self-titled debut made some impact upon its 1991 release, helping to re-establish the Southern Californian punk rock scene. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Fletcher Dragge – Guitar *Jim Lindberg – Vocals *Byron McMackin – Drums *Jason Thirsk – Bass *Fred Hidalgo – Logo Design, Cover Art *Gavin Oglesby – Artwork, Art Direction *Pennywise – Arranger, Composer, Group ==External links== *Pennywise at YouTube (streamed copy where licensed) Category:Pennywise (band) albums Category:1991 debut albums Category:Epitaph Records albums",
