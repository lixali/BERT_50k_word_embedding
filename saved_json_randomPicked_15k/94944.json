 "text": "Martin County is a county in Minnesota, United States. As of the 2020 United States Census, the population was 20,025. Its county seat is Fairmont. ==History== The county was created by the Minnesota Territory legislature on May 23, 1857, with Fair Mount (which was also platted in 1857) designated as county seat. The town's name was later shortened to Fairmont. Two explanations have been advanced for the county's name. A delegate to the US Congress from the Wisconsin Territory, Morgan Lewis Martin, introduced the legislative act to organize the Minnesota Territory. But in 1904 the county's oldest residents attested that the name referred to Henry Martin, an early settler from Connecticut who ran several businesses during the pre-territory era.Upham, Warren. Minnesota Geographic Names (1920), pp. 332-3 (accessed April 18, 2019) ==Geography== Martin County lies on Minnesota's border with Iowa. The East Fork of the Des Moines River flows southeastward through the lower western part of the county. The county terrain consists of low rolling hills, dotted with lakes and ponds, completely devoted to agriculture where possible.Martin County MN Google Maps (accessed April 18, 2019) The terrain slopes to the east and north, with its highest point near its southwest corner, at 1,407' (429m) ASL.
