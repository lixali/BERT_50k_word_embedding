In 1996, there were only 20 member schools worldwide, but it has massively expanded to about 200 schools today.The Good Schools Guide, Amanda Atha and Sarah Drummond, pp.343 (Macmillan 1996) Round Square is incorporated in England as a Company Limited by Guarantee (02011514) with the Registered Charity Number 327117. ==History== The concept of Round Square was conceived in 1966 based on the educational concepts of Kurt Hahn, who founded two of its original member schools, Schule Schloss Salem in Germany, with Prince Max of Baden, and Gordonstoun in Scotland. In 1966, King Constantine of the Hellenes, a former pupil of Anavryta (later a founding Round Square Member School), chaired a meeting of the heads of seven schools and proposed the creation of an international association of schools based on Kurt Hahn's principles of education. The association was later named after the Round Square building at Gordonstoun, where the first conference took place in 1967. ==Activities== Round Square schools encourage students to take part in a range of community service activities both locally and internationally. Many projects are run through the school and further opportunities are available via the Round Square Region, Network and Worldwide Organisation. The philosophy of Round Square is centered on the 6 IDEALS, namely the Spirit of Internationalism, the Spirit of Democracy, the Spirit of Environment, the Spirit of Adventure, the Spirit of Leadership, and finally, the Spirit of Service. The goal is to develop a sense of responsible leadership and deeper understanding of democratic practice. ==Member schools== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! School name !!
