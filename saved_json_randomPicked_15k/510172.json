 "text": "Lyle Rains was a senior executive at the arcade game company Atari and is sometimes, with Ed Logg, listed as a co-developer of the video game Asteroids. In fact, Rains called Logg into his office and said \"Well, why donâ€™t we have a game where you shoot the rocks and blow them up?\". Rains also served as Executive Producer for a large number of Atari coin-op games. An avid gamer, he wrote a popular online FAQ for the Atari coin-op game KLAX. He joined old compatriot video game designers in a new company called Innovative Leisure headed by Seamus Blackley in 2012 to design games for phones. ==Game credits== *Tank (1974) *Jet Fighter (1975) *Steeplechase (1975) *Sprint 2 (1976) - also credited with designing the well-known 'Atari arcade font'. *Sprint 4 (1977) *Atari Football (1978) *Sky Raider (1978) - game designer *Asteroids (1979) *Hard Drivin' (1988) *Race Drivin' (1990) *Space Lords (1992) ==References== ==External links== * History of Atari's Asteroids * Article at The Dot Eaters, on Rains and the development of Asteroids * Lyle Rains at Arcade-History.com Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Video game designers",
