 "text": "New Adventures in Hi-Fi is the tenth studio album by the American alternative rock band R.E.M. It was their fifth major-label release for Warner Bros. Records, released on September 9, 1996, in Europe and Australia, and the following day in the United States. New Adventures in Hi-Fi was the last album recorded with founding member Bill Berry (who left the band amicably the following year), original manager Jefferson Holt, and long-time producer Scott Litt. The members of R.E.M. consider the recorded album representative of the band at their peak, and fans generally regard it as the band's last great record before a perceived artistic decline during the late 1990s and early 2000s.Mojo, November 1996 It has sold around seven million units, growing in cult status years after its release, with several retrospectives ranking it among the top of the band's recorded catalogue. ==Composition and recording== The album was recorded during and after the tour in support of Monster in 1995. The material on the album mixed the acoustic, country rock feel of much of Out of Time and Automatic for the People with the rock sound of Monster and Lifes Rich Pageant. The band has cited Neil Young's 1973 album Time Fades Away as a source of inspiration. In an interview with Mojo, Mike Mills said: : alt=A view of the Pyramind Arena on the river|thumb|Memphis, Tennessee's Pyramid Arena was one of several locations used to record New Adventures in Hi-Fi alt=A photograph of Patti Smith looking to the side of the camera while performing onstage|thumb|Patti Smith—an influence on Peter Buck and Michael Stipe—added vocals to lead single \"E-Bow the Letter\" The band noted that they borrowed the recording process for the album from Radiohead, who recorded some of the basic tracks for The Bends while on tour and who supported the band in 1994 and 1995. R.E.M. took eight-track recorders to capture their live performances, and used the recordings as the base elements for the album. As such, the band's touring musicians Nathan December and Scott McCaughey are featured throughout, with Andy Carlson contributing violin to \"Electrolite\". After the tour was over, the band went into Seattle's Bad Animals Studio and recorded four additional tracks: \"How the West Was Won and Where It Got Us\", \"E-Bow the Letter\", \"Be Mine\" and \"New Test Leper\". Patti Smith came to the sessions and contributed vocals on \"E-Bow the Letter\". Audio mixing was finished at John Keane Studio in Athens and Louie's Clubhouse in Los Angeles with mastering by Bob Ludwig at Gateway Mastering in Portland, Maine. In part due to the nature of the recording process, several of the songs are about travel and motion—including \"Departure\", \"Leave\" and \"Low Desert\". The album's liner notes contain pictures from the road and the deluxe edition of the album is a hardcover book in a slipcase featuring more photographs of R.E.M.'s tour. ==Critical reception== Critical reaction to the album was mostly favorable. Several publications lauded the album for its rich diversity, including Rolling Stone, Q, and Mojo. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said, \"In its multifaceted sprawl, [R.E.M.] wound up with one of their best records of the '90s.\" At the same time, however, Melody Maker criticized the album's empty and flat sound caused by recording in arenas and soundchecks.Melody Maker, September 30, 1996 In a 2017 retrospective on the band, Consequence of Sound ranked it third out of R.E.M.'s 15 full-length studio albums. The album is Stipe's favorite from R.E.M. and he considers it the band at their peak. Radiohead singer Thom Yorke, who cited R.E.M. as a major influence, said it was his favorite R.E.M. album and \"Electrolite\" was the greatest song of their career. ===Awards=== New Adventures in Hi-Fi has since appeared on several lists compiling the best albums of the 1990s or all time: Magnet listed the album at #20 on its list of the \"Top 60 Albums 1993–2003\",Magnet Tenth Anniversary issue, January 2003 and Mojo also listed the album at #20 on a list of \"The 100 Greatest Albums of Our Lifetime 1993–2006\". It was voted #186 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (3rd Edition, 2000). It was also featured on several year-end best-of lists for 1996: *Entertainment Weekly (#2) *Eye Weekly (#11) *The Face (#28) *Magnet (#26) *Mojo (#4) *NME (#16) *Q (unranked) *Rock Sound (French edition) (#2) *Rolling Stone (#4) *Spin (#11) *Village Voice (#11) ==Track listing== All songs written by Bill Berry, Peter Buck, Mike Mills and Michael Stipe.

Record one has tracks 1–6 (three songs per side) and record two has tracks 7–14 (four songs per side). The tape release maintained the custom side names: the first side was called the \"Hi-side\" and the second side was called the \"Fi-side.\" ==Singles and B-sides== New Adventures in Hi-Fi consisted of material written during some of the same sessions as Monster and its following promotional tour; consequently, there were few outtakes or left-over tracks for inclusion as B-sides. The first three tracks were international singles, with \"How the West Was Won and Where It Got Us\" being released only in Germany and Japan. \"E-Bow the Letter\" *\"Tricycle\" – recorded during soundcheck at the Riverport Amphitheater, St. Louis, Missouri, on September 22, 1995. *\"Departure\" (Rome soundcheck version) – recorded during soundcheck at the PalaEur, Rome, Italy, on February 22, 1995. *\"Wall of Death\" (Richard Thompson) – taken from the Richard Thompson tribute album Beat the Retreat. \"Bittersweet Me\" *\"Undertow\" (Live) – recorded at the Omni Theater, Atlanta, Georgia, on November 18, 1995.

Other singles \"New Test Leper\" and \"The Wake-Up Bomb\" were released as promotional singles for the album; the former had a music video directed by Lance Bangs and Dominic DeJoseph. All five videos from the album were later collected on In View: The Best of R.E.M. 1988–2003. The R.E.M. fan club, which issued a special single every year at Christmas time, featured two singles recorded during these sessions: 1996's \"Only in America\" (originally by Jay & The Americans)/\"I Will Survive\" (a Gloria Gaynor cover) and 1997's R.E.M. original \"Live for Today\" was backed with Pearl Jam's \"Happy When I'm Crying\". ==Personnel== \"How the West Was Won and Where It Got Us\"
