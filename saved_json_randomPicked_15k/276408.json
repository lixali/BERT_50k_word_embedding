On the way home, she was persuaded by her Australian modelling booker to stop off in New York City to see if she could get some work.

She was his muse, but the age difference ... proved to be too great, and they divorced six years later (1989).\" In 1985, Macpherson became the longtime face of luxury French skin care company Biotherm..

After appearing nude in the 1994 film Sirens, Macpherson learned that the media had begun searching for nude photos of her, including contacting her ex-boyfriends. To address this, Macpherson appeared in a nude pictorial in the May 1994 issue of Playboy magazine, shot by Herb Ritts, to produce nude photos \"on her own terms\". In 1999, the twin island nation of Antigua and Barbuda honoured Macpherson by using her face on a series of postage stamps, the first model to appear on legal tender. Macpherson appeared among other Australian icons during the 2000 Summer Olympics closing ceremony, her elaborate float resembling a camera lens and featuring a runway.

In 1989, she was given the nickname Elle \"The Body\" Macpherson by Time magazine after she appeared on their cover. She went on to use the name in a number of business ventures. In 1996, Frank DeCaro of The New York Times cited Macpherson, along with Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Helena Christensen and Claudia Schiffer as \"The Magnificent Seven\". DeCaro reflected, \"Known by their first names to legions of fans, they are the legends of the modern catwalk, the girl next door pretty underneath all the paint\". In 1994, she left her agency, Ford Models, to form her own company, Elle Macpherson Inc., which would serve as the financial organizational base for her later endeavours. She soon went on to produce her own series of calendars, each of which was accompanied by a \"making of\" television program in 1992, 1993, and 1994. She used this as a springboard to create the \"Your Personal Best – The Body\" series of workout videos. She later diversified her portfolio of businesses, and in 1990 launched her lingerie collection 'Elle Macpherson Intimates' in partnership with Bendon Limited Apparel. Intimates became the single best-selling lingerie line in both Great BritainThe Sunday Times Business, 23 March 2008, p. 17: \"Macpherson, supermodel-turned-lingerie queen, has made that her leitmotif. Elle Macpherson Intimates range is the biggest selling brand of fashion lingerie in Britain.\" and Australia.Tatler, July 2002, vol. 297, num. 7, pp. 98–107: \"We're going through Elle's underwear. This is what she does. She designs knickers and bras. She's very good at it, very successful. It makes her more money than modelling, and Elle has made a lot of money modeling.\" The partnership was among the first instances of a crossover between a model and a fashion label. In 1989, when she was first approached by Bendon to promote their lingerie in Australia, Macpherson saw an opportunity to reverse their strategy and suggested a licensing arrangement, with products bearing her name and designs created in partnership with Bendon's team. Though commonplace now, the idea was unorthodox at the time. Macpherson took a significant role in the development and management of the company, serving as chief marketing officer and later Creative Director. In January 2010, Macpherson expanded the line, launching Obsidian as a sub-brand. While nursing her second child, she spearheaded the development of a signature maternity bra line.The Wall Street Journal Europe, Style Journal, Winter 2006 Edition, pp. 36–42: \"And so, Macpherson made the transition from model, to designer and chief marketing officer for the growing product line. The company credits her with the ideas for many products, including its successful maternity-bra line, which Macpherson designed while nursing her second child.\" Intimates has retained a high brand recognition into the 2000s, appearing as a featured brand on America's Next Top Model; last year, the brand celebrated 10 years of being stocked at Selfridges. Macpherson has also created her own line of beauty products: \"Elle Macpherson – The Body\". The line was carried at Boots, and Australian suncare brand Invisible Zinc. She spent a year on the board of directors at Hot Tuna Clothing, advising on product development, brand positioning and sales strategy. In 2007, the BBC TV series The Money Programme aired a documentary which followed Macpherson through her day-to-day business as she continued to develop her international lingerie business. In 2009 Macpherson delivered the Keynote Address at the annual meeting of the International Trademark Association. In 2014, Macpherson co-founded WelleCo, and released its flagship product, an alkalising wellness supplement, The Super Elixir.
