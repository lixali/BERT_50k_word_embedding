 "text": "Goof Troop is an American animated sitcom television series produced by Walt Disney Television Animation. The series focuses on the relationship between single father Goofy and his son, Max, as well as their neighbors Pete and his family. Created by Robert Taylor and Michael Peraza Jr., the main series of 65 episodes aired in first-run syndication from 1992 to 1993 on The Disney Afternoon programming block, while an additional thirteen episodes aired on Saturday Mornings on ABC. A Christmas special was also produced, which aired in syndication in late 1992. Walt Disney Pictures released two films that served as follow ups to the television series: the theatrical A Goofy Movie, released on April 7, 1995, as well as the direct-to-video sequel An Extremely Goofy Movie, released on February 29, 2000, as the series finale. ==Premise== Goof Troop bears similarity to several early-1950s Goofy cartoon shorts which depicted Goofy as a father to a mischievous red-haired son. It was the creation of Michael Peraza Jr., and pitched to Disney management as a last minute idea to fit the title. Goofy, a single father, moves back to his hometown of Spoonerville with his son, Max. As it happens, Goofy and Max end up moving in next door to Goofy's high school friend: Pete, a used car salesman and owner of Honest Pete's Used Cars; Pete's wife Peg, a real estate agent; and their two children, son P.J. (Pete Jr.) and younger daughter Pistol. Max and P.J. become best friends and do practically everything together. A large portion of the show's humor comes from Max's relatively normal personality sharply contrasting with his father. ==Broadcast history and feature films== Goof Troop was originally previewed on The Disney Channel from April 20, 1992, into July 12 of that year.The Disney Channel Magazine, Vol. 10, no. 2, March/April 1992: pp. 2, 20, 28, 42, 50.The Disney Channel Magazine, Vol. 10, no. 3, May/June/July 1992: pp. 40, 66. Like its predecessors DuckTales, Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers, TaleSpin and Darkwing Duck and its successor Bonkers, Goof Troop was previewed in syndication (on September 5, 1992) with a pilot television film, which later aired as a multi- part serial during the regular run. The series aired on The Disney Afternoon block of syndicated animated series during the 1992/1993 broadcast season; concurrent with the Disney Afternoon shows, another 13 episodes aired on Saturday mornings on ABC in 1992. Reruns of the series later aired on The Disney Channel (starting on September 3, 1996),The Disney Channel Magazine, Vol. 14, no. 4, August/September 1996: pp. 25, 28, 34. and later on sister cable channel Toon Disney. Reruns were shown on Toon Disney until January 2005. The program made a return from September 2006 until August 2008, and the Christmas special aired on Christmas in the United States. Goof Troop was adapted into the feature film A Goofy Movie (1995), which received mixed reviews but was a box office success. The film was followed by a direct-to- video sequel, An Extremely Goofy Movie (2000) and served as the finale to Goof Troop. The two films featured Bill Farmer, Rob Paulsen and Jim Cummings reprising their character roles from Goof Troop in these two films, with Jason Marsden providing the voice of an older Max. Dana Hill, who voiced Max in the series, commercials, promos, miscellaneous and other Disney projects, died on July 15, 1996, at the age of 32, after suffering a massive stroke related to her diabetes. The Goof Troop premise was also incorporated into 1999's Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas and its 2004 sequel, Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas, the former depicting Max at a much younger age preceding Goof Troop, while the latter continues Max's age progression to a young adult age. ==Character and place titles== Pete's wife Peg is a play on \"Peg Leg Pete,\" one of Pete's names in the Disney shorts. Likewise, his daughter Pistol is a play on another such name, \"Pistol Pete.\" The town of Spoonerville is named after layout artist J. Michael Spooner, who designed many of the background layouts for the series. In \"Axed by Addition,\" Max uses the \"Doctor Howard, Doctor Fine, Doctor Howard\" line to distract the doctors from performing surgery on PJ. This line was from the Three Stooges short, Men in Black. ==Characters== ===Main cast=== ====Goof Family==== *Goofer G. \"G.G. Goofy\" Goof: Goofy's diploma, as read aloud by the How-to Narrator, refers to him by the formal name of \"Mr. G. G. Goof\": Goofy's old high school yearbook from Spoonerville High writes Goofy's name as \"Goofy\" Goof, with the name \"Goofy\" written in quotation marks as though it were his nickname. (voiced by Bill Farmer) is the single father of Max Goof. In the pilot episode, he and his son move next door to the Petes from their trailer home in another city. Goofy's biggest weaknesses are his short attention span, scatterbrain, and clumsiness. He often drives his neighbor Pete up the proverbial wall. Goofy is very calm, lovable, and usually turns the other cheek when Pete insults him (or just doesn't realize he's been insulted). Occasionally, though, he does get angry and defensive toward Pete when the offense goes too far, but is very forgiving and still considers Pete to be his best friend no matter how often Pete is mean to him. *Maximilian \"Max\" Goof (voiced by Dana Hill), is the son and only child of Goofy. He is 11½ years old, and is in the same grade as his best friend P.J. at their junior high school. Contains a scene showing the front of the school with a sign over the entrance which says \"Spoonerville Jr. High\". Contains a scene showing the front of the school with a sign over the entrance which says \"Spoonerville Jr. High\", as well as a scene showing the school newspaper with the heading \"Spoonerville Jr. High\", and a scene showing one of the school's peripheral buildings with the label \"Spoonerville Jr. High School\" printed on its wall. While he is generally active, alert and friendly, he can also be very cunning and/or coercive when pushed or tricked, sometimes on par with or even exceeding Pete. He loves his dad, and is close to him, but wishes he would be a little more normal, feeling at times embarrassed by his father's clumsy and doting behavior. His interests in the series include skateboarding, video games, rock music, girls, and outwitting bullies. According to an interview with Disney Adventures, voice actress Dana Hill used her normal speaking voice while portraying Max. *Waffles (vocal effects by Frank Welker) is the Goofs' male pet cat. He is often a victim of the various hi-jinks that go on between his owners and their neighbors, the Petes. At times, Waffles is sneaky, mischievous, and self-serving, often trying to find ways to please himself with either a little extra food or messing with the Petes' dog Chainsaw, with whom Waffles has an antagonizing relationship. Other times, he exhibits a more laid-back attitude, lazily lying about comfortably minding his own business, wanting nothing more than some peace and quiet isolated from all the surrounding craziness of the Goofs' and Petes' lives. ====Pete Family==== *Peter P. Pete, Sr. (voiced by Jim Cummings) is a used-car salesman who lives with his beautiful wife, Peg, and two children, his son P.J. and his daughter Pistol. He and his family live next door to Goofy, whom Pete has known since childhood. He is dishonest, abrasive, cunning, and very stingy, often exploiting his goodhearted yet addled friend, Goofy, in his schemes to either get rich quick or better his own image. Though, his schemes often backfire, and at times does feel guilty about his horrible behavior and will work to set things right. His wife, Peg, often attempts to rid Pete of his uncouth attitude, and his son P.J. is the complete opposite of his father in behavior. In the series, he is both a co-protagonist and an anti-hero (though sometimes an anti-villain), viscerally hating Goofy most of time while tolerating and even helping him at other times. *Peg-Leg Pete (voiced by April Winchell) is Pete's wife and the mother of both P.J. and Pistol. Peg works as a real estate agent in Spoonerville. Over the course of the series, Peg is shown to be a headstrong mother who is wise, quick-witted, sarcastic, and at times short-tempered and cantankerous when crossed. Despite her and Pete often clashing over his many underhanded schemes, she does love her husband dearly, with their quarrels serving as a means to bring Pete around and keep him in check, and has been faithfully married to him for at least twenty years. Unlike her husband, she is always happy to see Goofy and Max. *Peter Pete, Jr. (voiced by Rob Paulsen) is the eldest child of Pete and Peg, Pistol's older brother, and best friend of Max. He and Max are in the same grade and have a very strong brotherly friendship. He is generally shy and timid, but also sensitive and kindhearted. He is often encouraged by Max to take more risks and go along with his ideas to achieve their goals, and usually finds himself on the receiving end of his father's many schemes. He will often play the role of accomplice to those who plot to thwart his father (usually Peg or Max), but has occasionally proven to have enough wits to see through his father's plans on his own. Like Max, he enjoys skateboarding, bike-riding, video games, and rock music, but also has a personal interest in poetry. *Pistol Pete (voiced by Nancy Cartwright) is the youngest child of Pete and Peg, and is P.J.'s younger sister. She is 4½–6 years old,: Both Pistol and Pete say that she is 4½ years old in this episode.: Pistol claims to be 6 years old in this episode.: Pistol claims to be \"almost 5\" in this episode. and is in Kindergarten. Pete absolutely adores Pistol and gives her just about anything and everything she wants with little resistance. Pistol is very cute, hyperactive, and talks with a lisp. She is both a girly girl who loves tea parties, cute animals, baby dolls, and playing circus, and also has a tomboy streak in her fascination with speed, extreme flying, professional wrestling, bugs, and gross-out television. Pistol tends to get herself into mischief, leading to P.J., Max, Pete, and/or Goofy getting into trouble in their attempts to bail her out. Pistol is very talkative, often asking many questions in rapid succession, and constantly annoys or charms some of her fellow characters. *Chainsaw (vocal effects by Frank Welker) is the Petes' female and pet dog. A vicious and, at times, mean little thing, Chainsaw harbors a strong hatred towards the Goofs' cat, Waffles, whom she often chases and barks at. However, she will at times find herself on the receiving end of some of Waffles' antics as, when not fleeing in panic of her, he may exhibit a streak of cunning and cleverness that Chainsaw doesn't see coming. Other times, Chainsaw can be found minding her own business, burying random objects in the yard or sleeping in places around the living room. On rare occasions, she and Waffles may tolerate each other enough to actually get along for a little bit. ===Other characters=== *The How-to Narrator is the snooty and instructive narrator of the classic \"How-To\" Goofy cartoons brought to life for the modern age by the voice of Corey Burton.

Even though they're dimwitted, they are described in the latter of the episodes as \"two of the most wanted crooks in the country\". *Brigadier General Robert E. Lee Sparrowhawk, Retired (voiced by William Windom) is a retired Army general who is Peg's \"Uncle Bob\" and the great-uncle of P.J. and Pistol.

He appeared in \"Close Encounters of the Weird Mime\", \"Slightly Dinghy\", \"Wrecks, Lies, and Videotape\", and \"Mrs. Spoonerville\". *Earl of Earl's Auto (voiced by Frank Welker) is Pete's main rival car dealer of the series. Though he only appeared in person in \"Rally Round the Goof\", his presence is known throughout the series with Pete referring to him or his dealership, Earl's Auto, in such episodes as \"Inspector Goofy\" and \"Goof Fellas\". **The episode \"Major Goof\" features another of Pete's rivals, named Earl Yokel, who may or may not be the same person as Earl of Earl's Auto, as his design was quite different from how Earl of Earl's Auto looked in \"Rally Round the Goof\". In Pete's Day at the Races Earl looks like Maggot, which may be Earl *Tan Roadster (voiced by Joe Piscopo) is a longtime rival car dealer of Pete's, having known him for years. Athletic and physically fit, he makes wisecracks about Pete's overweight stature and tries to steal Peg away from him, finding himself attracted to her strong will.

He and Pete compete to get a celebrity guest to appear in their dealership commercials. He recycles Biff Fuddled's animation model (meaning that he looks exactly like Biff) and appears only \"Buddy Building\". **Coop Hatchback (voiced by Conor Duffy, real- life son of Patrick Duffy) is the muscular son of Pete's rival Harold Hatchback, and friend of Max and P.J. He used to be known as \"Coopie Hatchback\", but changed his nickname after building his muscles. He saves Max and P.J. from Leech and unknowingly makes Max feel left out when P.J. begins to take more interest in Coop than he does in Max. In the end, the three of them all part on good terms with each other. His name is likely a pun on \"hatchback coupe\". He appears only in \"Buddy Building\". *Leech (voiced by Rob Paulsen) is a bully and small-time criminal who harasses little kids like Max and P.J., and often steals things from others. He appears in \"Buddy Building\" and \"Maximum Insecurity\". *The Chief of Police (voiced by Jim Cummings) is the no-nonsense chief of Spoonerville's police department.

In the episode \"A Goof of the People\", Goofy himself is elected the Mayor of Spoonerville. *Giblet the Clown (voiced by Frank Welker) is a red-nosed clown with red lips and hair, a party hat and tie, a car horn, and a green suit. He sells balloons at the Spoonerville Aviation Fair in \"Hot Air\", works with the Circus Ringmaster in \"Three Ring Bind\", and sells balloon animals (while also assisting both Max and movie star Ronald Streudelnossher with their respective problems) at Lake Zester in \"Buddy Building\". Giblet is often seen as abrasive and rather self-serving towards everyone including kids, like Pistol. *The Circus Ringmaster (voiced by Corey Burton) is the main antagonist in the episode \"Three Ring Bind\", in which he and Giblet try to sell their circus's animals to be made into puppy chow. He and Pistol become bitter enemies after the latter comes to the circus, plays with his animals, and then brings the animals home with her. *Douglas Twinkmeyer (voiced by Rob Paulsen) is a student at Spoonerville Jr. High School. A know-it-all who's called \"Twinky\" in gym class, he was formerly the most respected kid in school for being the chief of the Safety patrol. But after being exposed as the mastermind behind a plan to corner the market on a certain baseball card's value, which involved two bullies beating kids up for their money, he was reassigned to patrol Pistol's preschool. He is featured in \"Lethal Goofin'\", but can also be seen in the background of several other episodes. *Tooth and Nails (voiced by S. Scott Bullock and Candi Milo) were Douglas's bully henchmen who helped him carry out his plan by taking other kids' money so the two could buy all of the students' Lefty McGuffin baseball cards for Douglas to destroy, making his own Lefty McGuffin card the only one in existence.

Later, in \"A Pizza the Action\", Dutch is seen as a truck driver sent to tow the Goofs' house away after their pizza business failed, but ends up towing the Petes' house instead after a mix up. *Bubbles (voiced by Jennifer Darling) is a friendly, green pigmented, dragon-like dinosaur that hatches from an egg found by Max at Spoonerville's lake. Bubbles's gender was presumed by Max to be female, but Pistol used male pronouns (In the book adaptation, Bubbles is male). After she hatches, Max tries hiding Bubbles in his and Goofy's basement, but Goofy soon finds out about Bubbles after she grows bigger and bigger. Once she gets too big, Max and P.J. try to hide her from Pete, but Pistol finds out about Bubbles and helps expose her to Pete, who chases Bubbles through town after she had eaten his favorite chair. In the end, Goofy finds Bubbles's mother and helps her to save Bubbles from Pete. Bubbles and her mother return to the lake where she and Max bid farewell to one another. ===Goof History cast=== The \"Goof History\" episodes saw Goofy relating stories to Max from the family photo album about their various ancestors and family members, and also featured historical counterparts to several of the show's present-day main characters and supporting characters. ====Goof family members==== *Sir Goofy of Knock-Knees A.K.A.

These include A Goofy Movie, Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas, An Extremely Goofy Movie, Mickey Mouse Works, House of Mouse and Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas, all of which feature Goofy and Pete's respective families as major characters. Goofy and Pete also appeared on Bonkers and Raw Toonage in their Goof Troop designs. In the DuckTales reboot series' premiere episode, Spoonerville is mentioned amongst a number of locations that Scrooge McDuck's company, McDuck Enterprises, conducts business in. In the season three episode \"Quack Pack!\", Goofy in his Goof Troop design appears as a guest character as part of a 1990s sitcom the Duck Family had become trapped in. Max and P.J. also make non-physical appearances via Goofy's family pictures. ==Adaptations== A video game very loosely based on the series was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System sometime in July 1993. Two films loosely based on Goof Troop were made years after the show's end. The first film, A Goofy Movie, was released on April 7, 1995, to mixed reviews, but it has a cult following, particularly among millennials who grew up with the film and is a modest hit amongst viewers. The second film, An Extremely Goofy Movie, was released on video on February 29, 2000, which met with mixed reviews and with a more negative reception from viewers, including from the target audience. ==In other languages== * Danish: Max og Mule (English: Max and Goofy) * German: Goofy und Max * French: La Bande à Dingo * Finnish: Hopon poppoon * Italian: Ecco Pippo! * Japanese:『パパはグーフィー』(Papa wa Gūfī) (English: Papa Is Goofy) * Swedish: Långbens galna gäng (English: Goofy's crazy gang) * Norwegian: Langbein og sønn (English: Goofy and son) * Polish: Goofy i inni * Português: A Pandilha do Pateta, A Turma do Pateta e A Trupe do Pateta * Russian: Гуфи и его команда * Spanish: La tropa Goofy In English: Goofy's Troop ==References== ==External links== * * * * Goof Troop at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.
