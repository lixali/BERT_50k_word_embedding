 "text": "Daggett County ( ) is a county in the northeastern corner of the U.S. state of Utah. As of the 2020 United States Census, the population was 935, making it the least populous county in Utah. Its county seat is Manila. The county was named for Ellsworth Daggett, the first surveyor-general of Utah. The small community of Dutch John, located near the state line with Colorado and Wyoming, became an incorporated town in January 2016. ==History== Due to dangerous roads, mountainous terrain, and frequent bad weather preventing travel via a direct route, 19th century residents in the north portion of Uintah County had to travel on both stagecoach and rail to conduct business in Vernal, the county seat, a mere away. The journey involved overland travel to a train station in Wyoming, to either Mack, Colorado, Price, or Salt Lake City, then a stagecoach to Vernal. In the fall 1917 election, the Uintah county voters voted to establish a separate county on the northern slope of the Uinta Mountains. The act establishing the county was approved on January 7, 1918, naming Manila as the county seat. The boundary between Daggett and Uintah counties was adjusted in 1919, with some territory being returned to Uintah. Daggett County boundaries have remained unchanged since 1919. ==Geography== Daggett County lies at the lower northeastern corner of Utah. Its northern border abuts the south border of the state of Wyoming and its eastern boundary abuts the western border of the state of Colorado. Its main geographical features are the Uinta Mountains, which comprise its southwestern portion and delineate part of its southern border, and the Green River, which has carved a deep gorge through the east-central part of the county.Daggett County UT Google Maps (accessed 26 March 2019) In 1958, the United States Bureau of Reclamation took advantage of this natural feature to construct the Flaming Gorge Dam, creating the Flaming Gorge Reservoir, which began filling in 1964. The county terrain slopes to the north and east on the northern flank of the Uintas. The county's highest point is on a mountain crest along its south border, at 12,276' (3742m) ASL. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.3%) is water. It is the fourth-smallest county in Utah by area. Over 90% of the land of Daggett County is under federal ownership. ===Major highways=== * U.S. Route 191 * Utah State Route 43 * Utah State Route 44 * Utah State Route 1364 (Browns Park Rd) ===Adjacent counties=== * Sweetwater County, Wyoming - north * Moffat County, Colorado - east * Uintah County - south * Duchesne County - southwest * Summit County - west ===Protected areas=== * Ashley National Forest (part) * Browns Park Waterfowl Area * Browns Park Waterfowl Management Area * Clay Basin Wildlife Management Area * Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area (part) * Goslin Mountain Wildlife Management Area * Indian Crossing Campground (BLM) * Marshall Draw Wildlife Management Area * Taylors Flat Wildlife Management Area ===Lakes=== * Anson Lake * Big Springs * Browne Lake * Browns Park National Wildlife Refuge Reservoir * Chokecherry Spring * Cow Spring * Daggett Lake * Dowds Hole * Dripping Spring * East Grindstone Spring * Fighting Spring * Flaming Gorge Reservoir (part) * Ford Spring * Greens Lakes ** Greens Lake ** West Greens Lake * Grindstone Spring * Lamb Lakes * Long Park Reservoir * Pollen Lake * Potter Lake * Red Lake * Serviceberry Spring * Sheep Creek Lake * Spirit Lake (part) * Spitzenburg Spring * Stove Lake * Tepee Lakes * Weyman Lakes * Youngs Spring ==Demographics== ===2000 census=== As of the 2000 United States Census, there were 1,059 people, 426 households, and 287 families residing in the county.
