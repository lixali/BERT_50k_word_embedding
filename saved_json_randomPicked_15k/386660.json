Loran Scholars receive the country's largest undergraduate merit award on the basis of character, commitment to service and leadership potential. ==Loran Scholars== The Loran Scholars Foundation selects up to 36 students each year for an undergraduate scholarship valued at $100,000. It has been active since 1990. The scholarship is tenable at 25 public universities throughout Canada; however, the lower level awards (provincial awards and finalist awards) can be used at any public Canadian university or college. Twenty-two Loran Scholars have gone on to win Rhodes Scholarships. It consists of annual stipends, a matching tuition waiver, summer internship funding, annual retreats and scholar gatherings, and mentoring over four years of study. ===Candidate selection=== The Loran Scholar selection process is rigorous. The selection process is as follows: * Close to 2,500 nominees come as sponsored candidates, with endorsements from their schools. Each secondary school can sponsor up to three students, and each CEGEP in Quebec can sponsor up to eight students. Evaluations are made by 39 committees in 23 regions, from St. John's to Victoria, and then close to 500 semi-finalists, or approximately 10 candidates per committee, are chosen for regional interviews. * Over 2,500 candidates come through the direct pool (self-nomination). The national assessment panel evaluates the application of each candidate, and telephone interviews are conducted with semi-finalists in December. * Up to 88 finalists are invited from across Canada to attend two days of National Selections in Toronto. * Up to 36 candidates are selected as Loran Scholars. In addition, up to 104 candidates are offered finalist ($5,000) and provincial ($2,000) awards. ===Notable alumni=== Since the award was established in 1990, the foundation has selected 599 Loran Scholars. Past Loran Scholars include Lucas Skoczkowski, founder and former CEO of Redknee; Graham Fox, president and CEO of the Institute for Research on Public Policy; Diane Nalini de Kerckhove, a jazz musician and physicist; youth engagement leader and social justice advocate Michelle Dagnino; CPR assist device inventor Corey Centen; François Tanguay-Renaud, Director of York University's Jack & Mae Nathanson Centre on Transnational Human Rights, Crime and Security, and Associate Dean Research at Osgoode Hall Law School; Fédération des communautés Francophones et Acadienne du Canada (FCFA) executive director Alain Dupuis; Thalmic Labs co-founder and CEO Stephen Lake; and Orpyx CEO Breanne Everett.
