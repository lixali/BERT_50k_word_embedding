 "text": "\"Flying Without Wings\" is a song by Irish boy band Westlife, released on 18 October 1999 as the third single from their self-titled debut studio album (1999). It is the band's fourth-best-selling single on both paid-for and combined sales in the United Kingdom as of January 2019. ==Background== The song was written by Wayne Hector and Steve Mac. In an interview with HitQuarters, Hector said the basic idea for the song came to him while on a break from working on a hip hop session with Ezi Cut in Los Angeles: > I came up with a couple of lines for the first verse and then phoned my > mama's house, left it on the answering machine, and said, “Don't get rid of > this!”\"Interview With Wayne Hector\", HitQuarters, 1 February 2010. Upon returning to England, Hector went into the studio to work on the idea with long-time songwriting partner and producer Steve Mac. When the two discussed what the song was about they agreed that \"this is about our wives. This is about the things that make our lives complete.\" According to Hector the lyrics were completed in about half an hour. He added, \"Flying Without Wings was a life-changing moment, and a song he says he is particularly proud of. A big moment for me was when Flying Without Wings came out, I’d had a few Number 1s at that point, but that convinced people I could write good pop songs. After that, I started working with bigger acts and over a more diverse range of genres, including country and rock, which helped me pick up some credibility.\" The band's manager later revealed the song had been planned as the first solo single for Boyzone's Stephen Gately. \"Stephen did the demo and he thought it was going to be his song,\" Walsh recalls. \"I'll be quite honest, I missed it, but as soon as Simon heard it he just went bananas. It was really difficult because Westlife were on tour with Boyzone, as the support act.\" In a documentary aired on UTV called Westlife Back Home, band member Shane Filan said it is probably the best song of their career, while former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern (band member Nicky Byrne's father-in-law) revealed it is his favourite tune from the chart-topping band. The song also won the band their first of four Record of the Year prizes on the annual televised ITV music awards on 11 December 1999, scoring a total of 159,590 votes to beat Boyzone's Ronan Keating to the title. The Official Charts Company stated, \"Flying Without Wings wasn't the first boyband ballad, nor is it the biggest selling, but it was certainly influential. After Flying Without Wings, what self- respecting boyband would dare stay seated on a stool for a key change? Stand, boys! Flying Without Wings has soundtracked births, proposals, marriages, funerals, and untold TV talent show montages over the last two decades.\" ==Commercial performance== The song became the group's third UK number-one single, spending 13 weeks on charts. It is also one of Westlife's biggest selling singles. The song is the group's first single to received a Gold sales certification in the UK for over 400,000 copies sold. As of October 2019, Official Charts Company stated that the single have 316,000 physical sales, 171,000 downloads, and 16 million streams in the UK alone so far. ==Track listing== * United Kingdom CD1 # \"Flying Without Wings\" – 3:35 # \"Everybody Knows\" – 3:45 # \"Flying Without Wings\" (video) – 3:40 CD2 # \"Flying Without Wings\" – 3:35 # \"That's What It's All About\" – 3:20 # \"Flying Without Wings\" (acappella) – 3:29 * Australia # \"Flying Without Wings\" – 3:35 # \"I Have a Dream\" (remix) – 4:06 # \"Seasons in the Sun\" (single remix) – 4:10 # \"Flying Without Wings\" (video) – 3:40 ==Charts and certifications== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !Charts (1999–2000) !Peak position |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |10 |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Iceland (Íslenski Listinn Topp 40) |19 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" !Chart (1999) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) |67 |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (OCC) |58 |} {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (2000) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Belgium (Ultratop 50 Flanders) |82 |- !scope=\"row\"|New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) |43 |} ===Certifications and sales=== ==Duets== In 2002, as part of the promotion of their album Unbreakable: The Greatest Hits Volume 1, the song was re-recorded as a duet with Mexican singer Cristian Castro and South Korean pop singer, BoA.
