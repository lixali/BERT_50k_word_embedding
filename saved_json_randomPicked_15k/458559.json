It surrounds – but does not contain – the nation's capital Zagreb, which is a separate territorial unit. For that reason, the county is often nicknamed \"Zagreb ring\" (). According to the 2011 census, the county has 317,606 inhabitants, most of which live in smaller urban satellite towns. The Zagreb County once included the city of Zagreb, but in 1997 they separated, when the City was given a special status.Narodne novine, br. 62/01, 125/08 Although separated from Zagreb City County both administratively and territorially, it remains closely linked with it.

Franjo Tuđman Airport is located on the territory of Zagreb County, the biggest and most important airport in the country. == Administrative divisions == Zagreb County is divided into 9 towns and 25 municipalities. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+Towns |- ! style=width:7.5em | Name !
