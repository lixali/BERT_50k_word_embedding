Hawthorn, Leslie & Company Limited on the Tyne. She was launched on 22 February 1944 and commissioned on 25 September 1945. ==History== Solebay was intended to join the 19th Destroyer Flotilla of the British Pacific Fleet, but the war against Japan ended while Solebay was working up in the Mediterranean, and so she returned to Home Waters. She subsequently became Captain (D), or leader, of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla, part of the Home Fleet which was based in the United Kingdom. Solebay also took part in Operation Deadlight, the large-scale destruction of the German U-boat fleet, and which resulted in over one hundred of the boats being sunk in a variety of ways. In June 1953, Solebay was involved in the 1953 Fleet Review at Spithead, which took place in celebration of the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. Solebay was positioned in the middle of her sister ships and .Souvenir Programme, Coronation Review of the Fleet, Spithead, 15th June 1953, HMSO, Gale and Polden In July that year, Solebay was placed in Reserve with the rest of her flotilla. In 1957, Solebay returned to active service, becoming Captain (D) of the 1st Destroyer Squadron, which saw service with the Home and Mediterranean Fleets.

Solebay, along with another sister-ship, towed the heavily damaged Hogue to a nearby base.

During this deployment Solebay accidentally rammed her sister-ship , leader of the 7th Destroyer Squadron, while at Malta, delaying that Squadron's departure from the Mediterranean. While there, Solebay acted as escort for the royal yacht , carrying Queen Elizabeth, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, who were visiting Italy on a state visit. Solebay subsequently joined the Home Fleet. She once more joined up with the yacht Britannia and the Queen in Novemberâ€“December 1961, when Solebay formed part of the escort during the Queen's visit to West Africa. ==Decommissioning and disposal== In 1962, Solebays eventful career came to an end, when she was decommissioned and placed on the disposal list, becoming the Harbour Training Ship, being based at Portsmouth.
