 "text": "Ex-treme Dating (styled EX-treme Dating) is an American reality television show that paired two people (one man and one woman) on a blind date. The couple was chaperoned on the date by two of the person's ex-partners. They talked to the other person via an earpiece, feeding hints for conversation topics and comments on the date itself. At the end of the date, one person waited for a limousine. If the other person was in the car, the couple got a second date paid for by the show. If the person's ex-partners were in the car, the ex-partners themselves won a prize. The show was hosted by Jillian Barberie and premiered on July 8, 2002. The series ended on June 4, 2004 after two seasons. ==External links== * Ex-treme Dating ratings underwhelming * Category:American dating and relationship reality television series Category:2002 American television series debuts Category:2004 American television series endings Category:2000s American reality television series Category:2000s American game shows Category:American game shows Category:Television series by 20th Century Fox Television Category:First-run syndicated television programs in the United States",
