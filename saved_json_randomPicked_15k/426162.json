He was also Deputy Prime Minister from November 1986 to January 1996. ==First premiership== On 2 January 1996, Hosni Mubarak appointed Ganzouri as a replacement of Atef Sedki. During his appointment, he and his cabinet operated at a level that was unprecedented in Egypt's modern history. In about 4 years or less they declared 387 laws, 57 of those made dramatic changes to Egypt. He started his Prime Ministry with 4 major projects that were supposed to help move Egypt from the valley of the River Nile by developing and reclaiming new lands to live in away from the river Nile valley. His speciality in Planning enabled him to make a plan of development for Egypt up to 2017. He improved Egypt's relations with the International Bank through the International Monetary Fund by completing the only program ever completed between Egypt and the International Bank since 1961. 13 other programs had gone to nowhere back then. The poverty ratio was reduced from 21% to 17%. Many of his proposed projects were abandoned after he was dismissed as prime minister on 5 October 1999. == Life after first term as prime minister == Following his dismissal, he stayed completely away from the media. Some regime officials kept saying he didn't do any good to the country, and so his 20-year plan vanished while the 4 projects were neglected by the new cabinet. Even though, he had a good reputation among the people of Egypt and that was because of the major changes he had accomplished. === Support for the 2011 Egyptian revolution === Ganzouri then appeared for the first time in about 11 years of silence as the Egyptian Revolution broke and right after Hosni Mubarak stepped down in a phone call on \"Al Haya Al Youm\" television program saying that's a day of a new era in Egypt and that there is no going back from this day. He then reappeared in \"Al Ashera Masa'a\" TV program as his first dedicated interview after resurfacing. He started it with condolences to the protestors who died during the Egyptian Revolution, and stated that he was ready to be judged for whatever actions he took that damaged Egypt. He was later interviewed on Almasry Alyoum where he was asked if he would nominate himself for the Presidency of Egypt, but declined to answer saying that would be the people's choice to make. === Possible presidential candidacy === Immediately following his appearance on television, pages and groups on Facebook emerged supporting him for presidency. They grouped up and had an official page for Media outreach. Involvec parties therein expected to meet him and discuss his nomination. New Wafd Party sources were said to be thinking of backing him up as their own nominee. Nevertheless, he already had a big sector of people who supported him from the old days especially the limited income sector which is a big sector in Egypt's population. He mentioned nothing official after his last television appearance but he had some appearances in the press answering some corruption cases and investigations which were undertaken by his Cabinet that he did not approve of. ==Second premiership== After Essam Sharaf resigned as Prime Minister of Egypt on 21 November 2011, Supreme Council of the Armed Forces appointed Ganzouri to form a new coalition government on 24 November. He formed his \"Salvation Government\" on 3 December 2011 and was sworn in on 7 December. The military leadership stated as the cabinet was being sworn in that it has transferred all presidential powers to him, with the exception of affairs related to the judiciary and the military. His government resigned on 26 June 2012 after the election of Mohamed Morsi as President of Egypt to make way for the new government. ==Personal life and death== Ganzouri was married and had three daughters (Suzanne, Magda and Mona).
