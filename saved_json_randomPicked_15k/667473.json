Several types of aircraft, including helicopters, have been used by navies in the COD role. The Grumman C-2 Greyhound has been the United States Navy's primary COD aircraft since the mid-1960s. ==History== Early United States Navy (USN) recognition of need for a cargo plane capable of carrier landings resulted in airframe conversion of Grumman TBM-3 Avenger torpedo bombers to unarmed seven-passenger COD aircraft designated TBM-3R. Replacement of TBM-3Rs began in the late 1950s. Grumman built a cargo variant of its twin-piston-engined Grumman S-2 Tracker anti-submarine warfare bomber as the C-1A Trader. The Navy in 1963 briefly experimented with the C-130 Hercules for COD. In the late 1960s Grumman began production of a cargo variant of its twin-turboprop E-2 Hawkeye Airborne Early Warning aircraft known as the C-2A Greyhound. Five Lockheed US-3A Viking aircraft were also used from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s. The C-2 has remained the U.S. Navy's primary COD vehicle since that time. Several U.S. Navy \"Fleet Logistics Support Squadrons\" provided COD services aboard carriers since the World War II, including VR-5, VR-21, VR-22, VR-23, VR-24, VRC-30, VRC-40, and VRC-50. On 6 October 2012, a MV-22 tilt-rotor aircraft from squadron VMM-165 landed and refueled on board the . This operation was part of an evaluation of the feasibility of the MV-22 as a potential replacement for the current C-2 cargo transport aircraft. Further cargo handling trials took place in 2013 on . Video In April 2014 Lockheed Martin announced that they would offer refurbished and remanufactured Lockheed S-3 Vikings as a replacement for the decades-old Northrop Grumman C-2A Greyhound on-board carrier delivery aircraft. Dubbed the C-3, the aircraft would have a wider fuselage, but would retain the original wings, tail assembly, engines and crew compartment. With an unrefueled range of carrying a load, Lockheed stated that the C-3 would have twice the range of a new C-2, and triple the range of a V-22 Osprey. Unlike other competitors, the C-3 could meet the critical requirement to transport replacement Pratt & Whitney jet engines for the F-35. The requirement for 35 aircraft would be met from the 91 S-3s currently in storage.Lockheed Revives an Old Idea for New Carrier Cargo Plane In 2015, the Navy published a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for using 4 to 12 HV-22s as COD.Whittle, Richard. \"Navy Decides to Buy V-22 Ospreys for Carrier Delivery\" Breaking Defense, 13 January 2015.Navy and Marines Sign MOU for Bell-Boeing Osprey to be Next Carrier Delivery Aircraft - News.USNI.org, 13 January 2015 On 3 February 2016, the future COD version was designated as the CMV-22B. ==List of COD aircraft== Several aircraft types have been specifically designed or modified for COD missions: * Bell Boeing CMV-22B Osprey * Fairey Gannet COD.4 * Grumman/General Motors TBM-3R Avenger * Grumman TF-1/C-1A Trader * Grumman C-2 Greyhound * Lockheed US-3A Viking ==See also== * Military logistics * Seabasing * Sealift * Underway replenishment * Vertical replenishment (VERTREP) ==References== ==External links== * \"Carrier Onboard Delivery\" By Tommy H.
