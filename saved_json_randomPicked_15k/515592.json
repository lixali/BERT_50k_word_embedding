It is the most densely populated municipality in Portugal. ==History== There is significant evidence of Neolithic settlements in the municipality. The Necropolis of Carenque consists of three artificial caves that served as tombs from around 3000 BCE. Originally named Porcalhota, for being a Majorat of the daughter of a man surnamed Porcalho who was called for being a female Porcalhota. The Aqueduto das Águas Livres, which brings water from the Sintra hills to Lisbon, and stretches , was finished in the 1770s and includes the largest masonry arch ever built, located in Campolide — the local coat of arms also displays the aqueduct (like others along its way). At the request of its population, in 1907, a decree issued during King Carlos I reign, merged the communities of Porcalhota, Amadora and Venteira into one town named Amadora. At the present time Amadora does not have any airfield. However, in the 1920s a small airfield (the first in Portugal) was located here. The first flight from Portugal to Brazil left from Amadora. The Captain of the airplane was Adm. Gago Coutinho, a well known Portuguese celebrity. The municipality was formed on 11 September 1979, when it ceased being a parish of the municipality of Oeiras. A few days later, on 17 September, Amadora was granted city status. The former Sorefame railway rolling stock factory was located in Amadora, but was closed in 2004.
