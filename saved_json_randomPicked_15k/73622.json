 "text": "Manatee County is a county in the U.S. state of Florida. As of the 2020 US Census, the population was 399,710. Manatee County is part of the North Port- Sarasota-Bradenton Metropolitan Statistical Area. Its county seat and largest city is Bradenton. The county was created in 1855 and named for the Florida manatee, Florida's official marine mammal. Features of Manatee County include access to the southern part of the Tampa Bay estuary, the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, and the Manatee River. Manatee County ranks 15th among Florida counties in population. ==History== === Prehistoric History === The area now known as Manatee County had been inhabited by Native Americans for thousands of years. Shell middens and other archaeological digs have been conducted throughout the county including at Terra Ceia and at Perico Island. These digs revealed materials belonging to peoples from the Woodland period. === De Soto Expedition === Some historians have suggested that the southern mouth of the Manatee River was the landing site of the De Soto Expedition.Bullen. p. 7 === Settlement === thumb|Map of Manatee County as it existed in 1856, one year after it was created. The area was opened to settlement in 1842. The first two settlers were Joseph Braden and Hector Braden who moved into an area near the Manatee River. The two had lost their land for their plantations in Northern Florida during the Panic of 1837. They were said to have heard that there was abundant land in the area. The brothers moved into a log cabin 5 miles north of the mouth of the Manatee River. Four years later Hector had drowned while trying to cross the Manatee River on his horse during a hurricane. Despite this tragic event, Joseph decided he would still build his sugar plantation, the Braden sugar mill at the mouth of the Manatee River and the Braden River. He later built a dock where Main Street was and fortified the area near his house building a stockade. A few years later in 1851, he would build the Braden Castle, which was made out of tabby and served as his residence. It would later become a popular tourist attraction in the early 1900s with Tin Can Tourists. He would only stay there for the next six years before moving to Tallahassee. Manatee County had the Gamble Plantation, a sugar plantation that was one of the South's finest. When Manatee County was created in 1855, it included all of what are now Charlotte County, DeSoto County, Glades County, Hardee County, Highlands County, Sarasota County and part of Lee County ==Geography== According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (%) is water. ===Adjacent counties=== * Hillsborough County – north * Polk County – northeast * Hardee County – east * DeSoto County – southeast * Sarasota County – south ===State & Nationally protected areas=== * De Soto National Memorial * Passage Key National Wildlife Refuge * Lake Manatee State Park * Terra Ceia Preserve State Park * Myakka River State Park * Madira Bickel Mound State Archaeological Site ===Rivers=== * Manatee River ** Wares Creek ** Braden River *** Gamble Creek === Lakes === * Ward Lake * Lake Parrish * Lake Manatee ==Demographics== In 2020, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that the county's population was 399,710.

Manatee County's first public library was a privately owned rental library created by Julia Fuller at the Mrs. Bass Dry Goods store in 1898. The county's first independent library opened in Bradenton in 1907, followed a Carnegie Library in Palmetto in 1914 and another in Bradenton in 1918. For much of the 20th century, both cities' libraries were free to city residents while county residents had to pay a non-resident fee. In 1964, Bradenton's and Palmetto's library associations merged with the Manatee County government to create the Manatee County Public Library System. This was followed by the establishment of a bookmobile for rural areas in 1964 and a Talking Books program for the blind in 1966.Jasper, C. & McCook, K. (1998). The Florida Library History Project. University of South Florida, Tampa. Retrieved from https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED422005.pdf on 2022-02-19. pp. 180-181. As demands on the bookmobile grew and the library collection outstripped the existing buildings in Bradenton and Palmetto, the first branch of the Manatee County Public Library system was built in Bayshore in 1967, followed by a new branch on East Ninth Street in 1969 and an Island branch in 1971, the last of which later moved into a new building in 1983. A new building for the Palmetto Library was built in 1969, followed by the modern Central Public Library in downtown Bradenton in 1978.Jasper & McCook. p. 182 The 1990s saw a period of rapid growth in Manatee County, and the library system grew accordingly, with the Braden River, Rocky Bluff, and South Manatee branches opening in 1991, 1994, and 1998, respectively. The Braden River branch moved to a new building in 1997. The Rocky Bluff location would be moved to a larger location, featuring a built in café, in 2011. The new location is still physically within Ellenton. The additions as well as investment into various technologies such as modern computers, a 3D Printing Lab, as well as new loanable items, brings Manatee County Libraries to its modern services. Reciprocal borrowing began in 2000 between Manatee and Sarasota County Libraries, which would be followed by statewide reciprocal borrowing programs. Starting in 2017, the Manatee County library system began offering items including musical instruments, tools, telescopes, binoculars, cake pans, hotspots, and museum passes. During the COVID-19 Pandemic, the library system began offering WiFi hotspots to patrons in order to provide internet service remotely to work safely and at home. This began in Spring of 2020. ==Education== ===Primary and secondary education=== * Manatee County School District – Public K-12 School district serving all of Manatee County ===Higher education=== * Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine (LECOM) Bradenton – Private, non-profit graduate school of medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy * State College of Florida, Manatee–Sarasota (SCF) – Public, four- year state college, branch campus of State College of Florida ==Communities== ===Cities=== * Anna Maria * Bradenton * Bradenton Beach * Holmes Beach * Palmetto ===Town=== * Longboat Key ===Census-designated places=== * Bayshore Gardens * Cortez * Ellenton * Lakewood Ranch * Memphis * Samoset * South Bradenton * West Bradenton * West Samoset * Whitfield ===Unincorporated places=== * Cedar Hammock * Duette * Elwood Park * Fort Hamer * Foxleigh * Gillette * Lake Manatee * Manavista * Manhattan * Marsh Island * Memphis Heights * Myakka City * Oak Knoll * Oneco * Palm View * Palma Sola * Parrish * Rattlesnake Key * Rubonia * Rye * Snead Island * Tara * Terra Ceia * Verna * Village of the Arts * Ward Lake * Waterbury * Willow ==Transportation== Manatee County has a county transportation service, MCAT.

The area became a Republican stronghold following World War II and has remained so since: the last Democrat to win Manatee County was Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944. During the peak of the Socialist Party's prominence in the early 20th century, Manatee County would elect the only socialist to the state legislature, Andrew J. Pettigrew to the Florida House of Representatives in 1906 for one term defeating John A. Graham (who was a Democrat) in the general election.Griffin, R. Steven; ‘Workers of the Sunshine State, Unite! The Florida Socialist Party during the Progressive Era, 1900-1920’ (thesis) As a state legislator he would make several proposals that were inline with what the Party reflected at the national level such as making US Senators popularly elected and creating a national income tax. Overall as a state legislator he would make little progress in getting legislation proposed by him passed. Prior to the 1906 race he would run in 1904 for the same position unsuccessfully losing to A.T. Cornwell (also a Democrat) who had served as Bradenton's first mayor and in a variety of positions at the county level. Pettigrew would later go on to run for Governor in 1908 and Secretary of Agriculture in 1912 being unsuccessful in both races. === Law enforcement and justice === ==== Sheriff's Office ==== Unincorporated Manatee County is served by the Manatee County Sheriff's Office. ==== Justice ==== ===== Circuit Court ===== Manatee County is a part of the Twelfth Circuit Court of Florida. ===== Court of Appeals ===== Manatee County is part of the Second District of Appeals. ===Recent presidential election results=== {| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" |+ Manatee County vote by party in presidential elections |- !
