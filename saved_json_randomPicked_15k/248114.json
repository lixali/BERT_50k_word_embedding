 "text": "In mathematics, a cardinal number κ is called superstrong if and only if there exists an elementary embedding j : V -> M from V into a transitive inner model M with critical point κ and V_{j(\\kappa)} ⊆ M. Similarly, a cardinal κ is n-superstrong if and only if there exists an elementary embedding j : V -> M from V into a transitive inner model M with critical point κ and V_{j^n(\\kappa)} ⊆ M. Akihiro Kanamori has shown that the consistency strength of an n+1-superstrong cardinal exceeds that of an n-huge cardinal for each n > 0. == References == * Category:Set theory Category:Large cardinals",
