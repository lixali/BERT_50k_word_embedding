It belongs to the Pasiphae group, irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at distances ranging between 22.8 and 24.1 Gm, and with inclinations ranging between 144.5° and 158.3°. thumb|left|Animation of discovery images taken on 6 February 2003 thumb|left|Recovery images of S/2003 J 23 taken by the CFHT on 24 February 2017 This moon was considered lost until late 2020, when it was recovered by Sheppard and independently by amateur astronomer Kai Ly. The recovery of the moon was announced by the Minor Planet Center on 13 January 2021, while additional recovery observations by Sheppard were later published on 27 January 2021. == References == Category:Pasiphae group Category:Moons of Jupiter Category:Irregular satellites Category:Astronomical objects discovered in 2004",
