It stars Hayley Mills (in a dual role), Maureen O'Hara, and Brian Keith. Based upon the 1949 book Lottie and Lisa (German: ) by Erich Kästner, The Parent Trap follows two teenage twins on a quest to reunite their divorced parents. Produced by Walt Disney Productions, The Parent Trap was released on June 21, 1961 by Buena Vista Distribution, and grossed $25.1 million at the box office. It was nominated for two Academy Awards, was broadcast on television, saw three television sequels, was remade in 1998 with Lindsay Lohan, and has been released on digital stereo LaserDisc format in 1986 as well as VHS and DVD in 2002. The Parent Trap was Hayley Mills's second of six films for Disney. == Plot == Teenagers Sharon McKendrick and Susan Evers (Hayley Mills) meet at Miss Inch's Summer Camp for Girls. Their alike appearance initially causes resentment and a rivalry in which they continually pull pranks on each other, ultimately culminating in a fight that disrupts a dance with a neighboring boys camp. As punishment, they must room together in the isolated \"Serendipity\" cabin and have all meals at the \"Isolation Table\" for the remainder of the camp season. They eventually overcome their mutual dislike, then discover they are identical twin sisters. Their parents, Mitchell \"Mitch\" Evers (Brian Keith) and Margaret \"Maggie\" McKendrick (Maureen O'Hara), divorced shortly after their birth, splitting physical custody between them. Eager to meet the parent they never knew, the twins decide to switch places by having the same haircut and undergoing a crash-course on each other's life. In Boston with her mother and grandparents, Susan poses as Sharon, while Sharon, as Susan, goes to Mitch's California ranch. Sharon learns that Mitch has since become engaged to a beautiful and much younger woman named Vicky Robinson (Joanna Barnes), a gold digger who intends to send Susan to boarding school after the wedding. Sharon secretly calls Susan with the news. Susan tells her to break up the couple, but failing that, they decide to prematurely end the charade and bring their mother to California. The next morning, Susan reveals the truth to Maggie and her grandparents. After a happy reunion, Maggie and Susan fly to California. Mitch, still unaware of the switch, is upset by Maggie's unexpected arrival until he learns the truth and is reunited with both daughters. Vicky, however, is furious that the glamorous Maggie is staying at the ranch. The girls scheme to reunite their parents by recreating Maggie and Mitch's first date. The former spouses are gradually drawn together, then argue over why they divorced. They make up before Maggie and Sharon are to leave the next morning, and Maggie wishes Mitch well with Vicky. To delay the return to Boston, the twins dress alike so their parents are unable to tell them apart. They will reveal their identities only after returning from a family camping trip. Mitch and Maggie reluctantly agree, though Vicky is furious. Maggie then tricks Vicky, who loathes the outdoors, into taking her place, saying Vicky and the twins can become better acquainted. The twins take every opportunity to exploit Vicky's camping ineptitude, pulling one prank after another on her. Exasperated, Vicky finally has a shouting tantrum, ending in her angrily slapping one twin before storming off and fleeing back to the city for good. Mitch finally sees Vicky's true nature. Back at the house, the twins apologize for their actions. Maggie and Sharon prepare to return to Boston the next day, the twins now resigned to only seeing each other during visits and shuttling back-and-forth between parents. Later, Mitch tells Maggie everything he misses about her and their marriage. Both realize they still love each other and do not want to grow into old, lonely people. Susan wakes up during the night and tells Sharon about a beautiful dream she just had where they were bridesmaids at their parents' wedding, a dream destined to come true. == Cast == * Hayley Mills as Sharon McKendrick and Susan Evers, identical twins who were separated shortly after birth when their parents divorced.

WEILER. New York Times 4 Sep 1960: 79. The film was shot mostly at various locales in California. The summer camp scenes were filmed at Bluff Lake Camp (then owned by the Pasadena YMCA, now by Habonim Dror's Camp Gilboa) and the family camping scenes later in the movie at Cedar Lake Camp, both in the San Bernardino Mountains near the city of Big Bear Lake in Southern California. The Monterey scenes were filmed in various California locations, including millionaire Stuyvesant Fish's ranch in Carmel and Monterey's Pebble Beach golf course. The scenes at the Monterey house were shot at the studio's Golden Oak Ranch in Placerita Canyon, where Mitch's ranch was built. It was the design of this set that proved the most popular, and to this day the Walt Disney Archives receives requests for plans of the home's interior design. In fact, there never was such a house; the set was simply various rooms built on a sound stage. Camp Inch was based on a real girls' camp called Camp Crestridge for Girls at the Ridgecrest Baptist Conference Center near Asheville, North Carolina. == Musical numbers == Richard and Robert Sherman provided the songs, which, besides the title song \"The Parent Trap\", includes \"For Now, For Always\", and \"Let's Get Together\". \"Let's Get Together\" (sung by Annette Funicello) is heard playing from a record player at the summer camp; the tune is reprised by the twins when they restage their parents' first date and that version is sung double-tracked by Hayley Mills (Hayley's own single of the song, credited to \"Hayley Mills and Hayley Mills\", reached #8 on the US charts). The film's title song was performed by Tommy Sands and Annette Funicello, who were both on the studio lot shooting Babes in Toyland at the time. == Reception == Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote that \"it should be most appealing to adults, as well as to children, because of the cheerfully persuasive dual performance of Hayley Mills\".Crowther, Bosley (June 22, 1961). \"Hayley Mills Plays 2 Roles in Comedy\".
