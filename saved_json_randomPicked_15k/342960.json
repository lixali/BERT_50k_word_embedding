 "text": "right|thumb|Boulton, Watt and Murdoch right|thumb|Detail of engine plans Boulton, Watt and Murdoch is a gilded bronze statue depicting Matthew Boulton, James Watt, and William Murdoch by William Bloye, assisted by Raymond Forbes Kings. It stands on a plinth of Portland stone, outside the old Register Office on Broad Street in Birmingham, England. It is known locally as The Golden Boys after its colour, or The Carpet Salesmen after the partially rolled-up plan of a steam engine which they are examining. They were most famous for improving and developing the steam engine. Sponsored by an £8,000 bequest from Richard Wheatley in 1939, and £7,500 from the City Council, it was unveiled in 1956, from preliminary designs drawn up in 1938. The statue was restored, re-gilded, and replaced in September 2006. It was moved into storage on 23 August 2017 to permit construction of the West Midlands Metro. ==See also== *St. Mary's Church, Handsworth (memorials inside the church) ==References== ===General=== *Public Sculpture of Birmingham including Sutton Coldfield, George T.
