The most significant one is Thor, a character based on the deity of the same name from Norse mythology. Other deities from Norse myths were adapted for Thor's supporting cast, along with Heracles and other deities from Greco-Roman mythology. Deities from other pantheons are also adapted from time to time and there are also other original deities created by Marvel. ==Deities== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 99%;\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Pantheon !
