 "text": "Saint-Augustin-de-Desmaures is a city in central Quebec, Canada, on the Saint Lawrence River, adjacent to Quebec City. The town was founded in 1691 by three families (Desroches, Racette, Couture). It was merged with Quebec City on January 1, 2002 as part of the 2000–2006 municipal reorganization in Quebec and became part of the Laurentien borough of that city. However, after a 2004 referendum it was re-established as a separate city on January 1, 2006. The local post office was previously named Saint-Augustin-de-Portneuf from 1852, then Saint-Augustin-de-Québec from 1918 until this was renamed to the community's current name in 1986.Saint-Augustin-de-Desmaures at Commission de toponymie Québec ==Demographics== According to the Canada 2021 Census:Statistics Canada 2021 Census - Saint-Augustin-de-Desmaures community profile *Population: 19,907 *% Change (2016-2021): +5.8 *Private dwellings occupied by usual residents: 8,143 (total dwellings: 8,453) *Area (km2): 85.80 km2 *Density (persons per km2): 232 *Mother tongue: ** English as first language: 1.1% ** French as first language: 97.5% ** English and French as first language: 0.2% ** Other as first language: 1.2% Population trend:Statistics Canada: 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011, 2016, 2021 census * Population in 2021: 19,907 (2016 to 2021 population change: 5.8%) * Population in 2016: 18,820 * Population in 2011: 18,141 * Population in 2006: 17,281 * Population in 2001: 15,732 * Population in 1996: 14,771 * Population in 1991: 12,680 In 2006, Saint-Augustin-de-Desmaures was 98.0% White, 0.5% Aboriginal, and 1.5% Visible Minorities. ==See also== * Municipal reorganization in Quebec ==References== ==External links== Category:Cities and towns in Quebec Category:Populated places established in 1691 Category:Incorporated places in Capitale-Nationale Category:1691 establishments in the French colonial empire",
