Owned by Lex Luthor, the company is based in Metropolis and its headquarters is LexCorp Tower. ==History== The establishment of LexCorp by Lex Luthor is a stark departure from earlier portrayals of the company's founder, transitioning the character from a warlord and would-be dictator into a power-mad business magnate. LexCorp was founded primarily to serve as a front to Lex Luthor's criminal enterprise while simultaneously being a symbol of Luthor's victory over Superman, as Luthor values defeating the Superman over financial gain (illustrated by abandoning a hollow victory after plundering Fort Knox).Action Comics #277 Luthor intends to convert LexCorp into a legitimate operation after his retirement from crime, and in the future it is shown being a highly successful non-criminal enterprise, to Superman's pleasure.Superman #416 ===Organization and growth=== LexCorp was originally organized as an aerospace engineering firm started in the top floor offices of the Daily Planet building in Metropolis, and has since become one of the world's largest, most diversified multinational conglomerates. The company grew by acquisition, starting with struggling airlines \"Inter-Continental Airlines\" and \"Atlantic Coast Air Systems\", renaming them to \"LexAir\". When rising profits were threatened by fuel shortages, LexCorp bought out Southwestern Petroleum and renamed it \"LexOil\". This pattern of acquisition continued to include the Daily Planet and several Metropolis businesses before LexCorp sold the unprofitable Daily Planet and its building to TransNational Enterprises, establishing an L-shaped 96-story high-rise as its new headquarters. LexCorp grew rapidly into a diverse international conglomerate with interests in utilities, waste management, industrial manufacturing, computer hardware and software, chemicals, retail, bio-engineering, weapons, pharmaceuticals, oil, communications, airlines, real estate, hotels, restaurants, technology, media, financial services, robotics, security, transportation, satellites, stock brokerage houses, cash businesses, and food. By the timeframe of the Alliance Invasion it was estimated that LexCorp either directly or indirectly employed nearly two-thirds of Metropolis' population of 11 million people, dominating commerce around much of the world. Among those many subsidiaries are such diverse businesses as Advanced Research Laboratories, Secur-Corp Armored Car Service, North American Robotics, Hell's Gate Disposal Services, and the Good Foods Group, owners of Ralli's Family Restaurants and the Koul-Brau Breweries. LexCorp's major subsidiary companies include LexComp, LexChemical, LexEl Investments, LexMart, LexComm, FedLex, LexOil, LexAir, and TelLex. When CEO Lex Luthor was elected President of the United States, he divested from LexCorp to avoid a conflict of interest and Talia al Ghul became the company's CEO. Al Ghul donated a large portion of its profits to the Wayne Foundation during Superman and Batman's year-long absences.Superman #650 Following his dismissal as president he fired her and took back his place, though she secretly kept a portion of stock. Competitors include Wayne Enterprises, Kord Enterprises, Queen Industries and S.T.A.R. Labs. LexCorp provides sponsorship to the superhero team The Conglomerate along with American Steel, Dante Foods, Dupree Chemical, Ferris Aircraft, S.T.A.R. Labs, Ovel Oil, Pax Entertainment, and Stagg Enterprises.Justice League Quarterly #1 (Winter 1990) ===Decline=== Following Luthor's public acquittal from criminal charges Lana Lang became LexCorp's new CEOSuperman #654 and LexCorp began its decline.Superman #663 Lana Lang was dismissed from her post due to a contractual clause in all LexCorp employment charters forbidding aiding Superman in any way, after she attempted to use a LexCorp security unit to aid Superman in a battle against Atlas.Superman #679 A year after the events of Infinite Crisis, Lex Luthor had been stripped of his wealth and assets; LexCorp was dissolved and sold off to several competitors, most notably to Wayne Enterprises. ===Thunder Corporation=== Lex Luthor secretly owns the powerful and legitimate Thunder Corporation which he controls through a false identity, maintaining the illusion of the chairman/principal stockholder \"Lucius D. Tommytown\" through fake magazine articles and actors because he thought himself too honest to be anything but a criminal. The Thunder Corporation headquarters \"Zephrymore Building\" fronts Lex Luthor's criminal operations and penthouse. ==In other media== ===Television=== * LexCorp is depicted in the Ruby-Spears Superman cartoons. * LexCorp appears in the Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman television series. * LexCorp has been shown in episodes of Superman: The Animated Series and Justice League, with it being one of the tallest buildings in Metropolis. * The major conglomerate featured regularly on Smallville is LuthorCorp, an agricultural conglomerate which was founded by Lionel Luthor.
