It was first broadcast on BBC2 from February to March 1971, through the ABC in Australia and broadcast in America on PBS's Masterpiece Theatre. The series has been repeated several times, most recently from 17 February 2021, by BBC Four to celebrate the show's fiftieth anniversary. ==Production== Elizabeth R was filmed at a variety of locations including Penshurst Place which doubled as the queen's castle grounds and Chiddingstone in Kent, though all the interiors were recorded at the BBC Television Centre. The first episode was broadcast on 17 February 1971, beginning on screen with the year 1549 as the setting, with the then Princess Elizabeth's difficult ascent to the throne of England nine years later.History of the BBC at BBC.com The final episode was shown on 24 March 1971, the 368th anniversary of the Queen's death on March 24, 1603. It was repeated almost immediately in response to audience demand. The series followed the successful Six Wives of Henry VIII (1970), with several performers reprising their roles in Elizabeth R (all in the first episode) from the earlier series, notably Bernard Hepton as Cranmer, Basil Dignam as Bishop Gardiner and Rosalie Crutchley as Catherine Parr. In February 1972, Elizabeth R first aired in the United States on Masterpiece Theatre, then hosted by Alistair Cooke on PBS. In the summer of 1972, it was rebroadcast with commercials on the New York local station WOR-TV Channel 9. Glenda Jackson's performance in the title role won her two Emmy Awards - for Best Actress in a Drama Series and Best Actress in a Movie/TV Special (for the episode \"Shadow in the Sun\"). The series itself won the Emmy for the Best Dramatic Series in 1972 (the first British TV series ever to win the American TV award, before Upstairs, Downstairs carried the award two years later). At around the same time, Jackson also played the part of Elizabeth in the film Mary, Queen of Scots (1971).IMDB entry for Mary, Queen of Scots Costume designer Elizabeth Waller won an Emmy for her designs; she recreated many of the historical Elizabeth's actual gowns, adapting them from a number of the Queen's official portraits. They later went on display at Hampton Court Palace. Elizabeth R featured many well-known British actors, including Malcolm McFee, Michael Williams, Margaretta Scott, John Woodvine, James Laurenson, Angela Thorne, Brian Wilde, Robin Ellis, Robert Hardy, and Peter Egan. The series was parodied in Monty Python's Flying Circus in an absurdist sketch where a Japanese film director, disguised unconvincingly as Luchino Visconti, forces his cast to perform as Queen Elizabeth's court while sitting on motor- scooters and speaking Engrish. Therefore, the title was changed to \"Erizabeth L\". Elizabeth R was first released for DVD Region 1 during 2001 by BBC Warner and then re-released by BBC Worldwide in 2011. In DVD Region 2, it was issued by 2 Entertain in 2006. ==Cast== Note: This list is incomplete. * Glenda Jackson as Elizabeth I of England * Robert Hardy as Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester * Ronald Hines as Sir William Cecil, Lord Burghley * Stephen Murray as Sir Francis Walsingham * John Shrapnel as Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex * Bernard Horsfall as Sir Christopher Hatton * Robin Ellis as Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex * Jason Kemp as Edward VI of England * Daphne Slater as Mary I of England * Vivian Pickles as Mary, Queen of Scots * Hamilton Dyce as Amyas Paulet * Rachel Kempson as Kat Ashley * Peter Jeffrey as Philip II of Spain * Margaretta Scott as Catherine de' Medici * Michael Williams as François, Duke of Anjou (and Alençon) * James Laurenson as Jean de Simier * Jill Balcon as Lady Cobham, Lady-in-Waiting * David Collings as Anthony Babington * Bernard Holley as Gilbert Gifford * David Nettheim as Thomas Phelippes * John Graham as William Davison * John Woodvine as Sir Francis Drake * Peter Howell as Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham * John Nettleton as Sir Francis Bacon * Angela Thorne as Lettice Knollys * Hugh Dickson as Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury * Nicholas Selby as Sir Walter Raleigh * Clifford Rose as Thomas Egerton, 1st Viscount Brackley * John Ronane as Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley * Bernard Hepton as Archbishop Cranmer * Basil Dignam as Bishop Gardiner * John Ruddock as Archbishop Whitgift * Rosalie Crutchley as Catherine Parr * Brian Wilde as Richard Topcliffe * David Garfield as John Ballard * Peter Egan as Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton * Hayden Jones as Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy * Patrick O'Connell as Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone * Sonia Fraser as Elizabeth Wriothesley, Countess of Southampton * Shirley Dixon as Penelope Rich, Lady Rich * Judith South as Frances Radclyffe, Countess of Sussex * Raf De La Torre as John Dee * Stanley Lenore as Tyrwhit * Nicolette Bernard as Lady Tyrwhit * Kevin Brennan as Bridges * Julian Holloway as Antoine de Noailles * Brendan Barry as Simon Renard * Robert Garrett as Thomas Wyatt the Younger * Alan Foss as Sir Henry Bedingfield * Philip Brack as John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland * Ian Barritt as Fowler * Blake Butler as Parry * Richard Parry as Guard * Sarah Frampton as Lady Jane Grey * Robert Barry as Lord Guildford Dudley * Michael Culver as John Tregannon ==Episodes== ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1971 British television series debuts Category:1971 British television series endings Category:1970s British drama television series Category:BBC television royalty dramas Category:Cultural depictions of Edward VI of England Category:Cultural depictions of Elizabeth I Category:Cultural depictions of Mary I of England Category:English-language television shows Category:Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series winners Category:Television set in Tudor England",
