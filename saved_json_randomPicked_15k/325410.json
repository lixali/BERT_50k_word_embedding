 "text": "The little gull (Hydrocoloeus minutus or Larus minutus), is a small gull that breeds in northern Europe and across the Palearctic. The genus name Hydrocoloeus is from Ancient Greek , \"water\", and , a sort of web-footed bird. The specific is Latin for \"small\". It also has small colonies in parts of southern Canada. It is migratory, wintering on coasts in western Europe, the Mediterranean and (in small numbers) the northeast United States; in recent years non-breeding birds have summered in western Europe in increasing numbers and in 2016 they successfully nested for the first time in Great Britain at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds reserve at Loch of Strathbeg reserve in Aberdeenshire. As is the case with many gulls, it has traditionally been placed in the genus Larus. It is the only member of the genus Hydrocoloeus, although it has been suggested that Ross's gull also should be included in this genus. This species breeds colonially on freshwater marshes, making a lined nest on the ground amongst vegetation. Normally 2–6 eggs are laid. This is the smallest gull species, with a length of , a wingspan of , and a mass of . It is pale grey in breeding plumage with a black hood, dark underwings and often a pinkish flush on the breast. In winter, the head goes white apart from a darker cap and eye-spot. The bill is thin and black and the legs dark red. The flight on rounded wings is somewhat tern-like. Young birds have black markings on the head and upperparts, and \"W\" pattern across the wings. They take three years to reach maturity. These gulls pick food off the water surface, and will also catch insects in the air like a black tern. ==Gallery== File:Larus minutus MWNH 0340.JPG|Egg, Collection Museum Wiesbaden File:Dvärgmås-Larus minutus - Ystad2013.jpg|Adult in winter plumage File:Bird Yyterin lietteet 4.jpg|Juvenile; Yyteri, Pori, Suomi - Finland File:Hydrocoloeus minutus Russia 10.jpg|Adult Breeding plumage File:Hydrocoloeus minutus Russia 06.jpg|Picking food from the water surface ==References== ==External links== * * * * * * * Category:Gulls gull, little Category:Birds described in 1776 Category:Taxa named by Peter Simon Pallas",
