 "text": "Occitan (; ), also known as lenga d'òc (; ) by its native speakers, is a Romance language (or branch of numerous of these) spoken in Southern France, Monaco, Italy's Occitan Valleys, as well as Spain's Val d'Aran; collectively, these regions are sometimes referred to as Occitania. It is also spoken in Southern Italy (Calabria) in a linguistic enclave of Cosenza area (mostly Guardia Piemontese). Some include Catalan in Occitan, as the distance between this language and some Occitan dialects (such as the Gascon language) is similar to the distance among different Occitan dialects. Catalan was considered a dialect of Occitan until the end of the 19th century and still today remains its closest relative. Occitan is an official language of Catalonia, where a subdialect of Gascon known as Aranese is spoken in the Val d'Aran.As stated in its Statute of Autonomy approved. See Article 6.5 in the Parlament-cat.net , text of the 2006 Statute of Catalonia (PDF) Since September 2010, the Parliament of Catalonia has considered Aranese Occitan to be the officially preferred language for use in the Val d'Aran. Across history, the terms Limousin (Lemosin), Languedocien (Lengadocian), Gascon, and later Provençal (Provençal, Provençau or Prouvençau) have been used as synonyms for the whole of Occitan; nowadays, \"Provençal\" is understood mainly as the Occitan dialect spoken in Provence, in southeast France. Unlike other Romance languages such as French or Spanish, there is no single written standard language called \"Occitan\", and Occitan has no official status in France, home to most of Occitania. Instead, there are competing norms for writing Occitan, some of which attempt to be pan-dialectal, whereas others are based on particular dialects. These efforts are hindered by the rapidly declining use of Occitan as a spoken language in much of southern France, as well as by the significant differences in phonology and vocabulary among different Occitan dialects. According to the UNESCO Red Book of Endangered Languages, four of the six major dialects of Occitan (Provençal, Auvergnat, Limousin and Languedocien) are considered severely endangered, whereas the remaining two (Gascon and Vivaro-Alpine) are considered definitely endangered. ==Name== ===History of the modern term=== thumb|left|Main cities of Occitania, written in the Occitan language The name Occitan comes from the term (\"language of \"), being the Occitan word for yes. While the term would have been in use orally for some time after the decline of Latin, as far as historical records show, the Italian medieval poet Dante was the first to have recorded the term in writing. In his , he wrote in Latin, (\"for some say , others , yet others say \"), thereby highlighting three major Romance literary languages that were well known in Italy, based on each language's word for \"yes\", the language (Occitan), the language (French), and the language (Italian). This was not, of course, the only defining characteristic of each group. The word came from Vulgar Latin (\"this\"), while originated from Latin (\"this [is] it\"). Old Catalan and now the Catalan of Northern Catalonia also have (). Other Romance languages derive their word for \"yes\" from the Latin , \"thus [it is], [it was done], etc.\", such as Spanish , Eastern Lombard , Italian , or Portuguese . In Modern Catalan, as in modern Spanish, is usually used as a response, although the language retains the word , akin to , which is sometimes used at the end of yes–no questions and also in higher register as a positive response., 253.1 French uses to answer \"yes\" in response to questions that are asked in the negative sense: for example, (\"You have no brothers?\" \"But yes, I have seven.\"). The name \"Occitan\" was attested around 1300 as , a crossing of and (Aquitanian). ===Other names for Occitan=== For many centuries, the Occitan dialects (together with Catalan)Lapobladelduc.org , . The name of the language, in Catalan were referred to as Limousin or Provençal, after the names of two regions lying within the modern Occitan- speaking area. After Frédéric Mistral's Félibrige movement in the 19th century, Provençal achieved the greatest literary recognition and so became the most popular term for Occitan. According to Joseph Anglade, a philologist and specialist of medieval literature who helped impose the then archaic term Occitan as the sole correct name,: the word Lemosin was first used to designate the language at the beginning of the 13th century by Catalan troubadour Raimon Vidal de Besalú(n) in his : > The French language is worthier and better suited for romances and > pastourelles; but that (language) from Limousin is of greater value for > writing poems and cançons and sirventés; and across the whole of the lands > where our tongue is spoken, the literature in the Limousin language has more > authority than any other dialect, wherefore I shall use this name in > priority. As for the word Provençal, it should not be taken as strictly meaning the language of Provence, but of Occitania as a whole, for \"in the eleventh, the twelfth, and sometimes also the thirteenth centuries, one would understand under the name of Provence the whole territory of the old Provincia romana Gallia Narbonensis and even Aquitaine\".Camille Chabaneau et al, , 1872, p. 170: The term first came into fashion in Italy.: {{lang|oc|Ce terme fut surtout employé en Italie. Currently, linguists use the terms \"Provençal\" and \"Limousin\" strictly to refer to specific varieties within Occitania, keeping the name \"Occitan\" for the language as a whole. Many non-specialists, however, continue to refer to the language as Provençal, causing some confusion. ==History== One of the oldest written fragments of the language found dates back to 960, in an official text that was mixed with Latin: > Carolingian litanies (c. 780), both written and sung in Latin, were answered > to in Old Occitan by the audience (; ). Other famous pieces include the > Boecis, a 258-line-long poem written entirely in the Limousin dialect of > Occitan between the year 1000 and 1030 and inspired by Boethius's The > Consolation of Philosophy; the Waldensian (dated 1100),: (c. 1054–1076), > the Romance of Flamenca (13th century), the Song of the Albigensian Crusade > (1213–1219?), (12th or 13th century), (11th century) and (9th or 10th > century). Occitan was the vehicle for the influential poetry of the medieval > troubadours () and : At that time, the language was understood and > celebrated throughout most of educated Europe.Charles Knight, Penny > Cyclopaedia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, Vol. XXV, > 1843, p. 308: \"At one time the language and poetry of the troubadours were > in fashion in most of the courts of Europe.\" It was the maternal language of > the English queen Eleanor of Aquitaine and kings Richard I of England (who > wrote troubadour poetry) and John, respectively.

Some authors,Philippe Blanchet, Louis Bayle, Pierre Bonnaud and Jean Lafitte constituting a minority, reject this opinion and even the name Occitan, thinking that there is a family of distinct rather than dialects of a single language. Many Occitan linguists and writers,Kremnitz, Georg (2003) \"Un regard sociolinguistique sur les changements de la situation de l'occitan depuis 1968\" in: Castano R., Guida, S., & Latella, F. (2003) (dir.) Scènes, évolutions, sort de la langue et de la littérature d'oc. Actes du VIIe congrès de l'Association Internationale d'Études Occitanes, Reggio di Calabria/Messina, 7–13 juillet 2002, Rome: Viella particularly those involved with the pan-Occitan movement centered on the Institut d'Estudis Occitans, disagree with the view that Occitan is a family of languages; instead they believe Limousin, Auvergnat, Languedocien, Gascon, Provençal and Vivaro-Alpine are dialects of a single language. Although there are indeed noticeable differences between these varieties, there is a very high degree of mutual intelligibility between them For traditional Romance philology see: :*: (But phonetic, morphological, syntactical and lexical differences are not such that a person quite perfectly fluent in one of our dialects would not be able to have a conversation with another person speaking another dialect with an equally perfect fluency). :*. :For a discussion of the unity of the Occitan diasystem in structural linguistics see . partly because they share a common literary history; furthermore, academic and literary circles have identified them as a collective linguistic entity—the —for centuries. Some Provençal authors continue to support the view that Provençal is a separate language.Philippe Blanchet, Louis Bayle Nevertheless, the vast majority of Provençal authors and associations think that Provençal is a part of Occitan.The most emblematic and productive ones, Frédéric Mistral, Robert Lafont, and their followers (Théodore Aubanel, René Merle , Claude Barsotti, Philippe Gardy, Florian Vernet, Bernard Giély, Pierre Pessemesse...), and also the most important and historic Provençal cultural associations as CREO Provença, Felibrige and Parlaren (Assiso de la Lengo Nostro en Prouvènço, 2003) This debate about the status of Provençal should not be confused with the debate concerning the spelling of Provençal. * The classical orthography is phonemic and diasystemic, and thus more pan-Occitan. It can be used for (and adapted to) all Occitan dialects and regions, including Provençal. Its supporters think that Provençal is a part of Occitan. * The Mistralian orthography of Provençal is more or less phonemic but not diasystemic and is closer to the French spelling and therefore more specific to Provençal; its users are divided between the ones who think that Provençal is a part of Occitan and the ones who think that Provençal is a separate language. For example, the classical system writes Polonha, whereas the Mistralian spelling system has Poulougno, for , 'Poland'. The question of Gascon is similar. Gascon presents a number of significant differences from the rest of the language; but, despite these differences, Gascon and other Occitan dialects have very important common lexical and grammatical features, so authors such as Pierre Bec argue that they could never be considered as different as, for example, Spanish and Italian.: The close ties between Gascon and others Occitan dialects have been demonstrated through a common diasystem. In addition, Gascon's being included in Occitan despite its particular differences can be justified because there is a common elaboration (Ausbau) process between Gascon and the rest of Occitan. The vast majority of the Gascon cultural movement considers itself as a part of the Occitan cultural movement.Perso.orange.fr, Aranaram Au Patac And the official status of Val d'Aran (Catalonia, Spain), adopted in 1990, says that Aranese is a part of Gascon and Occitan. A grammar of Aranese by Aitor Carrera, published in 2007 in Lleida, presents the same view. The exclusion of Catalan from the Occitan sphere, even though Catalan is closely related, is justified because there has been a consciousness of its being different from Occitan since the later Middle Ages and because the elaboration (Ausbau) processes of Catalan and Occitan (including Gascon) have been quite distinct since the 20th century. Nevertheless, other scholars point out that the process that led to the affirmation of Catalan as a distinct language from Occitan started during the period when the pressure to include Catalan-speaking areas in a mainstream Spanish culture was at its greatest.Lluis Fornés, see his thesis. The answer to the question of whether Gascon or Catalan should be considered dialects of Occitan or separate languages has long been a matter of opinion or convention, rather than based on scientific ground. However, two recent studies support Gascon's being considered a distinct language. For the very first time, a quantifiable, statistics-based approach was applied by Stephan Koppelberg in attempt to solve this issue.Stephan Koppelberg, El lèxic hereditari caracteristic de l'occità i del gascó i la seva relació amb el del català (conclusions d'un analisi estadística), Actes del vuitè Col·loqui Internacional de Llengua i Literatura Catalana, Volume 1 (1988). Antoni M. Badia Margarit & Michel Camprubi ed. (in Catalan) Based on the results he obtained, he concludes that Catalan, Occitan, and Gascon should all be considered three distinct languages. More recently, Y. Greub and J.P. Chambon (Sorbonne University, Paris) demonstrated that the formation of Proto-Gascon was already complete at the eve of the 7th century, whereas Proto-Occitan was not yet formed at that time. These results induced linguists to do away with the conventional classification of Gascon, favoring the \"distinct language\" alternative. Both studies supported the early intuition of the late Kurt Baldinger, a specialist of both medieval Occitan and medieval Gascon, who recommended that Occitan and Gascon be classified as separate languages. ==Linguistic characterization== Jules Ronjat has sought to characterize Occitan with 19 principal, generalizable criteria. Of those, 11 are phonetic, five morphologic, one syntactic, and two lexical. For example, close rounded vowels are rare or absent in Occitan. This characteristic often carries through to an Occitan speaker's French, leading to a distinctive méridional accent. Unlike French, it is a pro-drop language, allowing the omission of the subject (: I sing; you sing)—though, at least in Gascon, the verb must be preceded by an \"enunciative\" in place of the pronoun, for questions, for observations, for other occasions: , (I am), (He/she is?), (We are.)Lo gascon lèu e plan, p.14. Among these 19 discriminating criteria, 7 are different from Spanish, 8 from Italian, 12 from Franco-Provençal, and 16 from French. ===Features of Occitan=== Most features of Occitan are shared with either French or Catalan, or both. ====Features of Occitan as a whole==== Examples of pan-Occitan features shared with French, but not Catalan: * Latin [uː] (Vulgar Latin ) changed to , as in French (Lat. > Oc. dur). * Vulgar Latin changed to , first in unstressed syllables, as in Catalan (Lat. > Oc. roman [ruˈma]), then in stressed syllables (Lat. > Oc. flor [fluɾ]). Examples of pan-Occitan features shared with Catalan, but not French: * Stressed Latin was preserved (Lat. > Oc. mar, Fr. mer). * Intervocalic -- was lenited to rather than lost (Lat. > Oc. vida, Fr. vie). Examples of pan-Occitan features not shared with Catalan or French: * Original preserved. * Final becomes (note in Valencian (Catalan), may appear in word-final unstressed position, in a process of vowel harmony). * Low-mid and diphthongized before velars. generally becomes ; originally became or , but has since usually undergone further fronting (e.g. to , etc.). Diphthongization also occurred before palatals, as in French and Catalan. * Various assimilations in consonant clusters (e.g. in Occitan, pronounced in conservative Languedocien). ====Features of some Occitan dialects==== Examples of dialect-specific features of the northerly dialects shared with French, but not Catalan: * Palatalization of to . * Vocalization of syllable-final to . * Loss of final consonants. * Vocalization of syllable- final nasals to nasal vowels. * Uvularization of some or all sounds. Examples of dialect-specific features of the southerly dialects (or some of them) shared with Catalan, but not French: * Latin become . * Betacism: and merge (feature shared with Spanish and some Catalan dialects; except for Balearic, Valencian and Algherese Catalan, where is preserved). * Intervocalic voiced stops (from Latin ) become voiced fricatives . * Loss of word-final single (but not , e.g. an \"year\" < ). Examples of Gascon-specific features not shared with French or Catalan: * Latin initial changed into (Lat. > Gasc. hilh). This also happened in medieval Spanish, although the was eventually lost, or reverted to (before a consonant). The Gascon has retained its aspiration. * Loss of between vowels. This also happened in Portuguese and Galician (and moreover also in Basque). * Change of to , or word-finally (originally the voiceless palatal stop , but now generally either or , depending on the word). This is a unique characteristic of Gascon and of certain Aragonese dialects. Examples of other dialect-specific features not shared with French or Catalan: * Merging of syllable-final nasals to . This appears to represent a transitional stage before nasalization, and occurs especially in the southerly dialects other than Gascon (which still maintains different final nasals, as in Catalan). * Former intervocalic (from Latin ) becomes /z/ (most dialects, but not Gascon). This appears to have happened in primitive Catalan as well, but Catalan later deleted this sound or converted it to . * Palatalization of (from Latin ) to in most dialects or : lach vs lait (Gascon lèit) 'milk', lucha vs luta (Gascon luta) 'fight'. * Weakening of to in the Vivaro-Alpine dialect. ===Comparison with other Romance languages and English=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:80%\" |----- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |+ Common words in Romance languages, with English (a Germanic language) for reference ||Latin (all nouns in the ablative case)|| Occitan (including main regional varieties)|| Catalan|| French || Norman || Ladin (Gherdëina) ||Lombard|| Italian|| Spanish || Portuguese || Sardinian || Romanian || English |----- bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" || ||c(h)antar ||cantar ||chanter ||canter, chanter ||cianté ||cantà ||cantare ||cantar ||cantar ||cantare ||cânta(re) ||'(to) sing' |----- bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" || ||c(h)abra (cabra) ||cabra ||chèvre ||quièvre ||cëura ||cavra ||capra ||cabra ||cabra ||craba ||capră ||'goat' |----- bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" || ||clau ||clau ||clef ||clef ||tle ||ciav ||chiave ||llave ||chave ||crae ||cheie ||'key' |----- bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" ||, ||(e)glèisa ||església ||église ||église ||dlieja ||giesa ||chiesa ||iglesia ||igreja ||gresia/creia ||biserică ||'church' |----- bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" || (Vulgar Latin), ||formatge (fromatge, hormatge) ||formatge ||fromage ||froumage, fourmage ||ciajuel ||furmai/furmagg ||formaggio ||queso ||queijo ||casu ||caș ||'cheese' |----- bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" || ||leng(u)a (linga) ||llengua ||langue ||langue ||lenga, rujeneda ||lengua ||lingua ||lengua ||língua ||limba ||limbă ||'tongue, language' |----- bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" || ||nuèch (nuèit) ||nit ||nuit ||nît ||nuet ||nocc ||notte ||noche ||noite ||nothe ||noapte ||'night' |----- bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" || ||plaça ||plaça ||place ||plache ||plaza ||piassa ||piazza ||plaza ||praça ||pratza ||piațăModern loanword from Italian or Greek (Iordan, Dift., 145) ||'square, plaza' |----- bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" || ||pont (pònt) ||pont ||pont ||pont ||puent ||punt ||ponte ||puente ||ponte ||ponte ||punte (small bridge) ||'bridge' |} ===Lexicon=== A comparison of terms and word counts between languages is not easy, as it is impossible to count the number of words in a language. (See Lexicon, Lexeme, Lexicography for more information.) Some have claimed around 450,000 words exist in the Occitan language,Avner Gerard Levy & Jacques Ajenstat: The Kodaxil Semantic Manifesto (2006), Section 10 – Modified Base64 / Kodaxil word length, representation, p. 9: \"the English language, as claimed by Merriam-Webster, as well as the Occitan language – are estimated to comprise over 450,000 words in their basic form.\" a number comparable to English (the Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged with 1993 addenda reaches 470,000 words, as does the Oxford English Dictionary, Second edition). The Merriam-Webster Web site estimates that the number is somewhere between 250,000 and 1 million words. The magazine Géo (2004, p. 79) claims that American English literature can be more easily translated into Occitan than French, excluding modern technological terms that both languages have integrated. A comparison of the lexical content can find more subtle differences between the languages. For example, Occitan has 128 synonyms related to cultivated land, 62 for wetlands, and 75 for sunshine (Géo). The language went through an eclipse during the Industrial Revolution, as the vocabulary of the countryside became less important. At the same time, it was disparaged as a patois. Nevertheless, Occitan has also incorporated new words into its lexicon to describe the modern world. The Occitan word for web (as in World Wide Web) is , for example. ===Differences between Occitan and Catalan=== The separation of Catalan from Occitan is seen by some as largely politically (rather than linguistically) motivated. However, the variety that has become standard Catalan differs from the one that has become standard Occitan in a number of ways. Here are just a few examples: * Phonology ** Standard Catalan (based on Central Eastern Catalan) is unique in that Latin short e developed into a close vowel (é) and Latin long e developed into an open vowel (è); that is precisely the reverse of the development that took place in Western Catalan dialects and the rest of the Romance languages, including Occitan. Thus Standard Catalan ésser corresponds to Occitan èsser/èstre 'to be;' Catalan corresponds to Occitan carrièra 'street', but it is also carriera , in Provençal. ** The distinctly Occitan development of word-final -a, pronounced in standard Occitan (chifra 'figure' ), did not occur in general Catalan (which has xifra ). However, some Occitan varieties also lack that feature, and some Catalan (Valencian) varieties have the pronunciation, mostly by vowel harmony. ** When in Catalan word stress falls in the antepenultimate syllable, in Occitan the stress is moved to the penultimate syllable: for example, Occitan pagina vs. Catalan pàgina , \"page\". However, there are exceptions. For example, some varieties of Occitan (such as that of Nice) keep the stress on the antepenultimate syllable (pàgina), and some varieties of Catalan (in Northern Catalonia) put the stress on the penultimate syllable (pagina). ** Diphthongization has evolved in different ways: Occitan paire vs. Catalan pare 'father;' Occitan carrièra (carrèra, carrèira) vs. Catalan carrera. ** Although some Occitan dialects lack the voiceless postalveolar fricative phoneme , others such as southwestern Occitan have it: general Occitan caissa vs. Catalan caixa and southwestern Occitan caissa, caisha , 'box.' Nevertheless, some Valencian dialects like Northern Valencian lack that phoneme too and generally substitute : caixa (Standard Valencian) ~ (Northern Valencian). ** Occitan has developed the close front rounded vowel as a phoneme, often (but not always) corresponding to Catalan : Occitan musica vs. Catalan música . ** The distribution of palatal consonants and differs in Catalan and part of Occitan: while Catalan permits them in word-final position, in central Occitan they are neutralized to and (Central Occitan filh vs. Catalan fill , 'son'). Similarly, Algherese Catalan neutralizes palatal consonants in word-final position as well. Non-central varieties of Occitan, however, may have a palatal realization (e.g. filh, hilh ). ** Furthermore, many words that start with in Occitan start with in Catalan: Occitan libre vs. Catalan llibre , 'book.' That feature is perhaps one of the most distinctive characteristics of Catalan amongst the Romance languages, shared only with Asturian, Leonese and Mirandese. However, some transitional varieties of Occitan, near the Catalan area, also have initial . ** While is always clear in Occitan, in Catalan it tends to be velarized (\"dark l\"). In coda position, has tended to be vocalized to in Occitan, while remained dark in Catalan. ** Standard Eastern Catalan has a neutral vowel whenever a or e occur in unstressed position (passar , 'to happen', but passa , 'it happens'), and also whenever o or u occur in unstressed position, e.g. obrir , 'to open', but obre , 'you open'. However, that does not apply to Western Catalan dialects, whose vowel system usually retains the a/e distinction in unstressed position, or to Northern Catalan dialects, whose vowel system does not retain the o/u distinction in stressed position, much like Occitan. * Morphology ** Verb conjugation is slightly different, but there is a great variety amongst dialects. Medieval conjugations were much closer. A characteristic difference is the ending of the second person plural, which is -u in Catalan but -tz in Occitan. ** Occitan tends to add an analogical -a to the feminine forms of adjectives that are invariable in standard Catalan: for example, Occitan legal / legala vs. Catalan legal / legal. ** Catalan has a distinctive past tense formation, known as the 'periphrastic preterite', formed from a variant of the verb 'to go' followed by the infinitive of the verb: donar 'to give,' va donar 'he gave.' That has the same value as the 'normal' preterite shared by most Romance languages, deriving from the Latin perfect tense: Catalan donà 'he gave.' The periphrastic preterite, in Occitan, is an archaic or a very local tense. * Orthography ** The writing systems of the two languages differ slightly. The modern Occitan spelling recommended by the Institut d'Estudis Occitans and the Conselh de la Lenga Occitana is designed to be a pan-Occitan system, and the Catalan system recommended by the Institut d'Estudis Catalans and Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua is specific to Catalan and Valencian. For example, in Catalan, word-final -n is omitted, as it is not pronounced in any dialect of Catalan (Català, Occità); central Occitan also drops word-final -n, but it is retained in the spelling, as some eastern and western dialects of Occitan still have it (Catalan, Occitan). Some digraphs are also written in a different way such as the sound , which is ll in Catalan (similar to Spanish) and lh in Occitan (similar to Portuguese) or the sound written ny in Catalan and nh in Occitan. ===Occitano-Romance linguistic group=== Despite these differences, Occitan and Catalan remain more or less mutually comprehensible, especially when written – more so than either is with Spanish or French, for example, although this is mainly a consequence of using the classical (orthographical) norm of the Occitan, which is precisely focused in showing the similarities between the Occitan dialects with Catalan. Occitan and Catalan form a common diasystem (or a common Abstandsprache), which is called Occitano-Romance, according to the linguist Pierre Bec.Bec, Pierre. (1995). La langue occitane, coll. Que sais-je? nr. 1059. Paris: Presses Universitaires de France [1st ed. 1963] Speakers of both languages share early historical and cultural heritage. The combined Occitano-Romance area is 259,000 km2, with a population of 23 million. However, the regions are not equal in terms of language speakers. According to Bec 1969 (pp. 120–121), in France, no more than a quarter of the population in counted regions could speak Occitan well, though around half understood it; it is thought that the number of Occitan users has decreased dramatically since then. By contrast, in the Catalonia administered by the Government of Catalonia, nearly three-quarters of the population speak Catalan and 95% understand it.Gencat.net ==Preservation== In the modern era, Occitan has become a rare and highly threatened language. Its users are clustered almost exclusively in Southern France, and it is unlikely that any monolingual speakers remain. In the early 1900s, the French government attempted to restrict the use and teaching of many minority languages, including Occitan, in public schools. While the laws have since changed, with bilingual education returning for regions with unique languages in 1993, this movement caused serious decline in the number of Occitan speakers. The majority of living speakers are older adults. ==Occitan quotes== One of the most notable passages of Occitan in Western literature occurs in the 26th canto of Dante's Purgatorio in which the troubadour Arnaut Daniel responds to the narrator: :Tan m'abellís vostre cortés deman, / qu'ieu no me puesc ni voill a vos cobrire. / Ieu sui Arnaut, que plor e vau cantan; / consirós vei la passada folor, / e vei jausen lo joi qu'esper, denan. / Ara vos prec, per aquella valor / que vos guida al som de l'escalina, / sovenha vos a temps de ma dolor. :Modern Occitan: Tan m'abelís vòstra cortesa demanda, / que ieu non-pòdi ni vòli m'amagar de vos. / Ieu soi Arnaut, que plori e vau cantant; / consirós vesi la foliá passada, / e vesi joiós lo jorn qu'espèri, davant. / Ara vos prègui, per aquela valor / que vos guida al som de l'escalièr, / sovenhatz-vos tot còp de ma dolor. The above strophe translates to: :So pleases me your courteous demand, / I cannot and I will not hide me from you. / I am Arnaut, who weep and singing go;/ Contrite I see the folly of the past, / And joyous see the hoped-for day before me. / Therefore do I implore you, by that power/ Which guides you to the summit of the stairs, / Be mindful to assuage my suffering! Another notable Occitan quotation, this time from Arnaut Daniel's own 10th Canto: :\"Ieu sui Arnaut qu'amas l'aura :e chatz le lebre ab lo bou :e nadi contra suberna\" Modern Occitan: :\"Ieu soi Arnaut qu'aimi l'aura :e caci [chaci] la lèbre amb lo buòu :e nadi contra subèrna. Translation: :\"I am Arnaut who loves the wind, :and chases the hare with the ox, :and swims against the torrent.\" French writer Victor Hugo's classic Les Misérables also contains some Occitan. In Part One, First Book, Chapter IV, \"Les œuvres semblables aux paroles\", one can read about Monseigneur Bienvenu: :\"Né provençal, il s'était facilement familiarisé avec tous les patois du midi. Il disait: — E ben, monsur, sètz saget? comme dans le bas Languedoc. — Ont anaratz passar? comme dans les basses Alpes. — Pòrti un bon moton amb un bon formatge gras, comme dans le haut Dauphiné. [...] Parlant toutes les langues, il entrait dans toutes les âmes.\" Translation: :\"Born a Provençal, he easily familiarized himself with the dialect of the south. He would say, E ben, monsur, sètz saget? as in lower Languedoc; Ont anaratz passar? as in the Basses-Alpes; Pòrti un bon moton amb un bon formatge gras as in upper Dauphiné. [...] As he spoke all tongues, he entered into all hearts.\" :E ben, monsur, sètz saget?: So, Mister, everything's fine? :Ont anaratz passar?: Which way will you go? :Pòrti un bon moton amb un bon formatge gras: I brought some fine mutton with a fine fat cheese The Spanish playwright Lope de Rueda included a Gascon servant for comical effect in one of his short pieces, La generosa paliza.Registro de Representantes by Lope de Rueda, in Spanish. Peirutón speaks a mix of Gascon and Catalan. John Barnes's Thousand Cultures science fiction series (A Million Open Doors, 1992; Earth Made of Glass, 1998; The Merchants of Souls, 2001; and The Armies of Memory, 2006), features Occitan. So does the 2005 best-selling novel Labyrinth by English author Kate Mosse. It is set in Carcassonne, where she owns a house and spends half of the year. The French composer Joseph Canteloube created five sets of folk songs entitled Songs of the Auvergne, in which the lyrics are in the Auvergne dialect of Occitan. The orchestration strives to conjure vivid pastoral scenes of yesteryear. Michael Crichton features Occitan in his Timeline novel. ==See also== * Baìo * History of the Basque language * Languages of France * Languages of Italy * Languages of Spain * Occitan cross * Occitan cuisine ==Notes== ===Explanatory footnotes=== ==Bibliography== * * * * * * * * Ursula Reutner: \"‘Minor‘ Gallo-Romance Languages‘“.
