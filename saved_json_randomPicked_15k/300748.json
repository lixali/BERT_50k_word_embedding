 "text": "Corporate accountability is the acknowledgement and assumption of responsibility for the consequences of a company's actions. It can be defined in narrowly financial terms, e.g. for a business to meet certain standards or address the regulatory requirements of its business activities. Corporate accountability may also be applied more broadly, such as expectations for a publicly-traded company to be accountable to its employees and local community rather than focusing exclusively on earning profits in the short-term for the benefit of its shareholders. == See also == * Environmental, social and corporate governance * Corporate social responsibility * Corporate crime == References == Category:Problems in business economics Category:Corporate conduct",
