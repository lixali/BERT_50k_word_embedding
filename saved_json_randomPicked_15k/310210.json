 "text": "Andy Lau Tak-wah (; born 27 September 1961) is a Hong Kong actor, singer- songwriter and film producer. He has been one of Hong Kong's most commercially successful film actors since the mid-1980s, performing in more than 160 films while maintaining a successful singing career at the same time. In the 1990s, Lau was branded by the media as one of the Four Heavenly Kings of Cantopop and was named as \"Fourth Tiger\" among the Five Tiger Generals of TVB during the 1980s. In the Philippines, he was previously given the screen name Ricky Chan. Lau entered into the Guinness World Records for the \"Most Awards Won by a Cantopop Male Artist\". By April 2000, he had already won an unprecedented total of 292 awards. Lau also holds numerous film acting awards, having won the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor three times and the Golden Horse Award for Best Leading Actor twice. In 2005, Lau received the \"No.1 Box office Actor 1985–2005\" award of Hong Kong, yielding a box office total of HK$1,733,275,816 for shooting 108 films in the past 20 years, and in 2007, he received the \"Nielsen Box Office Star of Asia\" award by the Nielsen Company (ACNielsen). On 25 June 2018, Lau was invited to be a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. == Early life == Andy Lau was born in Tai Po, Hong Kong, a son of a fireman Lau Lai (劉禮). He was the fourth child of the family; he has three elder sisters, one younger sister, and a younger brother named Lau Tak- sing. His family was considered to be wealthy as his grandfather was a landowner, but his father left with him to the slums of Diamond Hill when he was six, where the area was full of wooden houses, and was burnt down when he was eleven. As a young boy, Lau had to fetch water for his family up to eight times a day because their house was not equipped with plumbing. He graduated from a Band One secondary school, Ho Lap College in San Po Kong, Kowloon. He was named as Lau Fook-wing (劉福榮) during his academic years. He also practices Chinese calligraphy. Lau converted to Buddhism in the 1980s. He was raised in a nominally Buddhist household and is now a follower of the Lingyan Mountain Temple in Taiwan. == Career == === Actor === In 1981, Lau signed up for the artist training program offered by TVB, which is where his acting career began. The lead role which led to his initial popularity was in the 1982 TVB series The Emissary. In 1983, Lau's role as \"Yang Guo\" in the TVB wuxia series, The Return of the Condor Heroes (神鵰俠侶) further increased his popularity. From then on, he took on many of the lead roles in many TVB series. In September 1983, TVB was looking to increase their ratings in competition with Korea and Japan for the best variety show. The station then created the show TVB All-star challenge (星光熠熠勁爭輝) featuring almost the entire line-up of the most popular actors and singers at the time..\" 第二章 影視新星 無線電視臺的五虎將. Korea referred as Goryeo (高麗). Retrieved on 31 January 2010. Lau, along with Tony Leung, Michael Miu, Felix Wong, and Kent Tong were branded as the \"Five Tiger Generals of TVB\" (無線五虎將) due to their popularity on the show. In the late '80s, Lau left TVB due to contract problems. TVB wanted to bind him to an exclusive five-year contract which Lau refused to sign, so TVB blacklisted him. He then focused on his film career. In 1981, Lau made a guest appearance in one of Susanna Kwan's music videos and caught the eye of the manager Teddy Robin. Teddy Robin then gave Lau a chance to play a small role in the film, Once Upon a Rainbow. This was the first step in Lau's film acting career. He landed a role in Ann Hui's 1982 film, Boat People. Later in 1983 he had his first leading role in the Shaw Brothers-produced action film, On the Wrong Track. One of his early leading roles included the more serious 1988 film, The Truth (法內情). However, Lau is best known in films for his (often) recurring roles as a \"Heroic Gangster\", such as Wong Kar-wai's 1988 film As Tears Go By (旺角卡門) and Benny Chan's 1990 film A Moment of Romance. Although now a respected actor, Lau was initially known more for his handsome features. Some people he has worked with have called him a matinee idol, but he has claimed to be an artist. Lau has proved his acting skills in many of his films. His first major acting prize came with A Fighter's Blues, which was his first Golden Bauhinia Award for Best Actor.Dianying.com. \"Dianying.com.\" 第 6 屆金紫荊獎頒獎. Retrieved on 31 January 2010. He won the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor award that year for Running Out of Time. In 2004, he won the Golden Horse Award for Best Leading Actor for his performance in Infernal Affairs III, the second sequel to the popular Infernal Affairs. In 2005, Lau received the \"No.1 Box office Actor 1985–2005\" award of Hong Kong, yielding a box office total of HKD 1,733,275,816 for shooting 108 films in the past 20 years. The aforementioned figure is as compared to the first runner-up Stephen Chow's (HKD 1,317,452,311) and second runner-up Jackie Chan's (HKD 894,090,962). \"I've never imagined that it would be as much as 1.7 billion!\" he told reporters. For his contributions, a wax figure of Lau was unveiled on 1 June 2005 at the Madame Tussauds Hong Kong. In 2007, Lau also received the \"Nielsen Box Office Star of Asia\" award by the Nielsen Company (ACNielsen). In February 2021, Lau reunited with Tony Leung since the Infernal Affairs series in the big-budget action film Once Upon a Time in Hong Kong, backed by Emperor Motion Pictures and mainland Chinese partners, with a reported budget of around $30.8 million (RMB200 million).

Some of the films Lau has produced include award-winning films, Made in Hong Kong and A Simple Life, his 100th film, A Fighter's Blues, the Chinese digital film Crazy Stone, and big budget action blockbusters, Firestorm and Shock Wave. === Musical career === thumb|250px|Andy Lau in concert 2011 Lau released his first album \"Only Know that I Still Love You\" (只知道此刻愛你) under Capital Artists in 1985.

His singing career reached stellar status in 1990 with the release of the album entitled \"Would It Be Possible\" (可不可以), and his subsequent releases only solidified his status as a marketable singer.

Many of Lau's songs quickly topped the music charts not only in Hong Kong, but also in Taiwan, Mainland China, and in many different parts of Asia. Some of his most notable hits include \"The Days We Spent Together\" (一起走過的日子), \"If You Are My Legend\" (如果你是我的傳說), \"The Tide\" (潮水), \"Forget Love Potion\" (忘情水), \"True Forever\" (真永遠), \"Chinese people\" (中國人), \"Love You Forever\" (愛你一萬年), \"You Are My Woman\" (你是我的女人), and \"Secret Admiration\" (暗裡著迷).

He also sang the theme song \"Flying with the Dream\" with Han Hong during the Paralympics opening ceremony on 6 September 2008. As a songwriter, most of Lau's creative works are as a lyricist.
