After a broken toe ended her dancing career, Glau moved to Los Angeles in 2002 to pursue acting. ==Career== thumb|upright|Glau at CollectorMania 2005 Glau's first television credit was a guest role as a ballerina on a 2002 episode of the television series Angel.

Glau previously auditioned for the role of a Power Ranger (White Wild Force Ranger Alyssa Enrilé) in Power Rangers Wild Force but lost to actress Jessica Rey before meeting Whedon.
