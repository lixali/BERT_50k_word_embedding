They were joined by Martyn Barker on drums in 1983. Their early music was a funk-influenced version of new wave and post-punk, later moving towards art rock and always featuring \"insidiously weird vocals\".https://trouserpress.com/reviews/shriekback/ ==History== Shriekback was originally formed in 1981 by Barry Andrews and Dave Allen, expanding to a trio with the addition of Carl Marsh.Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, They enjoyed some success on the dance chart on their original Y Records label, and had a string of hits on the UK Indie Chart, while their debut album, Care (1983) was picked up by Warner in the United States. They left Y for Arista Records for 1984's Jam Science, also recruiting drummer Martyn Barker. The album reached number 85 on the UK Albums Chart, and \"Hand on my Heart\" was a number 52 UK single. They recorded the 1985 album Oil and Gold on Arista (released by Island Records in the US).Shriekback â€“ Oil And Gold, Discogs.com, retrieved 4 November 2015 Marsh left Shriekback during the recording of Oil and Gold and was replaced on guitar by Mike Cozzi, with Andrews taking over lead vocals. Shriekback also left Arista and signed to Island Records for whom they recorded Big Night Music (1986), after which Allen left to rejoin Gang of Four, and Shriekback remained a collaborative centered on Andrews. Allen would also go on to play in King Swamp and The Elastic Purejoy. Marsh was also in the band Happyhead. After another album in 1988, Go Bang!, the band split up. Andrews continued working on other projects before re-forming Shriekback in 1992, although after the single \"The Bastard Sons of Enoch\" and album Sacred City, there would be no further releases until Naked Apes and Pond Life (2000). Both Allen and Marsh returned to the studio to contribute to the recording of the 2003 release Having a Moment. After Having a Moment, Andrews recorded three albums for Malicious Damage (Killing Joke's original label) under the Shriekback moniker. Shriekback are still actively producing music and released the studio album, Why Anything? Why This?, in May 2018. The same line-up of Andrews, Barker, and Marsh self- released their 15th studio album, Some Kinds of Light, on 6 December 2019. ==Members== Other than those listed above, Shriekback members or contributors have included Luc van Acker, Linda Nevill, Emma Burnham, Brian Nevill, Pedro Ortiz, Clare Hirst, Lu Edmonds, Wendy and Sarah Partridge (from Electric Guitars), Steve Halliwell, Eve Moon, Ivan Julian, Mike Cozzi, and Jessica Palin/Jose Fina Cupido. ==In other media== Film director Michael Mann was a fan of the band, and used several Shriekback songs in his films Manhunter and Band of the Hand and in his television series Miami Vice. Music composed by Shriekback is used as the theme song for the Squaring the Strange podcast hosted by Benjamin Radford and Pascual Romero. The duo selected it because of their fondness for music from the 1980s. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * Tench (EP) (1982) Y (UK Indie No. 9Lazell, Barry (1997) Indie Hits 1980-1989, Cherry Red Books, ) * Care (1983) Y (UK Indie No. 7) * Jam Science (1984) Arista (UK No. 85) * Oil and Gold (1985) Arista * Big Night Music (1986) Island * Go Bang!
