Estimating war-related deaths poses many challenges. Experts distinguish between population-based studies, which extrapolate from random samples of the population, and body counts, which tally reported deaths and likely significantly underestimate casualties. Population-based studies produce estimates of the number of Iraq War casualties ranging from 151,000 violent deaths as of June 2006 (per the Iraq Family Health Survey) to 1,033,000 excess deaths (per the 2007 Opinion Research Business (ORB) survey). Other survey-based studies covering different time-spans find 461,000 total deaths (over 60% of them violent) as of June 2011 (per PLOS Medicine 2013), and 655,000 total deaths (over 90% of them violent) as of June 2006 (per the 2006 Lancet study). Body counts counted at least 110,600 violent deaths as of April 2009 (Associated Press). The Iraq Body Count project documents 185,000–208,000 violent civilian deaths through February 2020 in their table.

The Iraq Body Count (IBC) project records its numbers based on a \"comprehensive survey of commercial media and NGO-based reports, along with official records that have been released into the public sphere. Reports range from specific, incident based accounts to figures from hospitals, morgues, and other documentary data- gathering agencies.\" The IBC was also given access to the WikiLeaks disclosures of the Iraq War Logs. Iraq Body Count project data shows that the type of attack that resulted in the most civilian deaths was execution after abduction or capture. These accounted for 33% of civilian deaths and were overwhelmingly carried out by unknown actors including insurgents, sectarian militias and criminals. 29% of these deaths involved torture. The following most common causes of death were small arms gunfire at 20%, suicide bombs at 14%, vehicle bombs at 9%, roadside bombs at 5%, and air attacks at 5%. The IBC project, reported that by the end of the major combat phase of the invasion period up to April 30, 2003, 7,419 civilians had been killed, primarily by U.S. air-and-ground forces. The IBC project released a report detailing the deaths it recorded between March 2003 and March 2005 in which it recorded 24,865 civilian deaths. The report says the U.S. and its allies were responsible for the largest share (37%) of the 24,865 deaths. The remaining deaths were attributed to anti-occupation forces (9%), crime (36%) and unknown agents (11%). It also lists the primary sources used by the media – mortuaries, medics, Iraqi officials, eyewitnesses, police, relatives, U.S.-coalition, journalists, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), friends/associates and other. According to a 2010 assessment by John Sloboda, director of Iraq Body Count, U.S. and Coalition forces had killed at least 22,668 insurgents as well as 13,807 civilians in the Iraq War, with the rest of the civilians killed by insurgents, militias, or terrorists. The IBC project has been criticized by some, including scholars, who believe it counts only a small percentage of the number of actual deaths because of its reliance on media sources.Staff writer (April 28, 2006). \"Iraq Body Count – Media Lens Responds\" . Newsnight. Retrieved September 3, 2010. The IBC project's director, John Sloboda, has stated, \"We've always said our work is an undercount, you can't possibly expect that a media-based analysis will get all the deaths.\"Fuller, David.

However, the IBC project rejects many of these criticisms as exaggerated or misinformed. According to a 2013 Lancet article, the Iraq Body Count is \"a non-peer-reviewed but innovative online and media-centred approach that passively counted non-combatant civilian deaths as they were recorded in the media and available morgue reports. In passive surveillance no special effort is made to find those deaths that go unreported. The volunteer staff collecting data for the IBC have risked criticism that their data are inherently biased because of scarcity or absence of independent verification, variation in original sources of information, and underestimation of mortality from violence... In research circles, random cross-sectional cluster sampling survey methods are deemed to be a more rigorous epidemiological method in conflict settings.\" === IBC table of violent civilian deaths === Following are the yearly IBC Project violent civilian death totals, broken down by month from the beginning of 2003.

After deployment, 6.2 percent to 19.9 percent suffered from PTSD. For the broad definition of PTSD that represents an increase of 10.5 percent (19.9 percent – 9.4 percent = 10.5 percent).

(The show had not been able to confirm the remaining sixteen names.) Claiming that the broadcast was “motivated by a political agenda designed to undermine the efforts of the United States in Iraq\", the Sinclair Broadcast Group took the action of barring the seven ABC network-affiliated stations it controls from airing the show.

Concern has been expressed by mental health professionals about the effects on the emotional health and development of returning veterans' infants and children, due to the increased rates of interpersonal violence, posttraumatic stress, depression, and substance abuse that have been reported among these veterans. Moreover, the stressful effects of physical casualties and loss pose enormous stress for the primary caregiver that can adversely affect her or his parenting, as well as the couple's children directly. The mental health needs of military families in the aftermath of combat exposure and other war-related trauma have been thought likely to be inadequately addressed by the military health system that separates mental health care of the returning soldier from his or her family's care, the latter of whom is generally covered under a contracted, civilian managed-care system. == Iraqi insurgent casualties == Total insurgent deaths are hard to estimate.Staff writer (July 26, 2005). \"50,000 Iraqi Insurgents Dead, Caught\" .

It estimated 24,000 war-related violent deaths by May 2004 (with a 95 percent confidence interval from 18,000 to 29,000). This study did not attempt to measure what portion of its estimate was made up of civilians or combatants. It would include Iraqi military killed during the invasion, as well as \"insurgents\" or other fighters thereafter. This study has been criticized for various reasons. For more info see the section in Lancet surveys of Iraq War casualties that compares the Lancet and UNDP ILCS studies. === Lancet (2004) === The October 2004 Lancet study done by public health experts from Johns Hopkins University and published on October 29, 2004, in The Lancet medical journal, estimated that 100,000 \"excess\" Iraqi deaths from all causes had occurred since the U.S. invasion began. The study did not attempt to measure how many of these were civilian, but the study's authors have said they believe that the \"vast majority\" were non-combatants, based on 7% of the casualties being women and 46% being children under the age of 15 (including Falluja data). To arrive at these excess death figures, a survey was taken from 988 Iraqi households in 33 clusters throughout Iraq, in which the residents were asked how many people lived there and how many births and deaths there had been since the war began. They then compared the death rate with the average from the 15 months before the war. Iraqis were found to be 1.5 times more likely to die from all causes after the invasion (rising from 0.5% to 0.79% per year) than in the 15 months preceding the war, producing an estimate of 98,000 excess deaths. This figure excluded data from one cluster in Falluja, which was deemed too much of an outlier for inclusion in the national estimate. If it included data from Falluja, which showed a higher rate of violent deaths than the other 32 clusters combined, the increased death rate would be raised from 1.5 to 2.5-fold, violent deaths would be 58 times more likely with most of them due to air-strikes by coalition forces, and an additional 200,000 fatalities would be estimated. === Iraqiyun estimate (2005) === The Iraqi non-governmental organisation, Iraqiyun, estimated 128,000 deaths from the invasion until July 2005. A July 2005 United Press International (UPI) article said the number came from the chairman of the Iraqiyun humanitarian organization in Baghdad, Dr. Hatim al-'Alwani. He said 55 percent of those killed were women, and children aged 12 and under. The UPI article reported: \"Iraqiyun obtained data from relatives and families of the deceased, as well as from Iraqi hospitals in all the country's provinces. The 128,000 figure only includes those whose relatives have been informed of their deaths and does not include those were abducted, assassinated or simply disappeared.\"Iraqi civilian casualties . United Press International. July 12, 2005. Archived here too. A 2010 book by Nicolas Davies reported the Iraqiyun estimate, and that Iraqiyun was affiliated with the political party of Interim President Ghazi Al-Yawer. Davies wrote: \"The report specified that it included only confirmed deaths reported to relatives, omitting significant numbers of people who had simply disappeared without trace amid the violence and chaos.\"Blood on Our Hands: The American Invasion and Destruction of Iraq.

Article is here , too. === Lancet (2006) === The October 2006 Lancet study by Gilbert Burnham (of Johns Hopkins University) and co-authors estimated total excess deaths (civilian and non-civilian) related to the war of 654,965 excess deaths up to July 2006. The 2006 study was based on surveys conducted between May 20 and July 10, 2006. More households were surveyed than during the 2004 study, allowing for a 95% confidence interval of 392,979 to 942,636 excess Iraqi deaths. Those estimates were far higher than other available tallies at the time. The Burnham et al. study has been described as the most controversial study in survey research on armed conflict,Kristine Eck, \"Survey Research in Conflict and Post-conflict Societies\" in Understanding Peace Research: Methods and Challenges (eds. Kristine Hoglund & Magnus Oberg), Routledge: 2011, p. 171. and its findings have been widely disputed in the academic literature. Shortly after publication, the study's estimate and methodology came under criticism from a number of sources, including the United States government, academics, and the Iraq Body Count.Knickmeyer, Ellen (October 19, 2006). \"One-Day Toll in Iraq Combat Is Highest for U.S. in Months – At Least 12 Killed in Fresh Attacks on Iraqi Police Facilities\" . The Washington Post. Retrieved September 3, 2010. At the time, other experts, praised the methodology of the study.Badkhen, Anna (October 12, 2006). \"Critics Say 600,000 Iraqi Dead Doesn't Tally – But Pollsters Defend Methods Used in Johns Hopkins Study\" . San Francisco Chronicle. Retrieved September 3, 2010.Bennett-Jones, Owen (March 26, 2007). \"Iraqi Deaths Survey 'Was Robust'\" . BBC World Service (via BBC News'). Retrieved September 3, 2010. John Tirman, who commissioned and directed the funding for the study defended the study.\"Right-Wingers Can't Cover Up Iraq's Death Toll Catastrophe\" . By John Tirman. January 21, 2008. AlterNet. A 2008 systematic review of casualty estimates in the Iraq War in the journal Conflict and Health concluded that the highest quality studies have used \"population-based methods\" that have \"yielded the highest estimates. A 2016 study described the Lancet study as seen \"widely viewed among peers as the most rigorous investigations of Iraq War–related mortality among Iraqi civilians,\" and argued that part of the criticism \"may have been politically motivated.\" A number of peer-reviewed studies criticized the Lancet study on the basis of its methodology and exaggerated casualty numbers. The authors of the Lancet study were also accused of ethical breaches in terms of how the survey was conducted and in how the authors responded to requests for data and information. In 2009, the lead author of the Lancet study was censured by American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) for refusing to provide \"several basic facts about\" the study. AAPOR had over a 12-year period only formally censured two other individuals. In 2012, Michael Spagat noted that six peer-reviewed studies had identified shortcomings in the Lancet study, and that the Lancet authors had yet to make a substantive response to the critiques. According to Spagat, there is \"ample reason\" to discard Lancet study estimate. Columbia University statistician Andrew Gelman said in 2014 that \"serious flaws have been demonstrated\" in the Lancet study, and in 2015 that his impression was that the Lancet study \"had pretty much been discredited\". Joshua Goldstein, professor emeritus of International Relations at American University, wrote that critics of the study \"have argued convincingly that the sample method was biased.\" According to University of Delaware sociologist Joel Best in his book Stat-Spotting: A Field Guide to Identifying Dubious Data, \"it seems likely that [the Lancet estimate] was too large\". Conflict scholars Nils Petter Gleditsch, Erik Melander and Henrik Urdal said there were \"major biases\" in the study, leading to oversampling of households affected by violence. A 2008 study in the Journal of Peace Research found that the 2006 Lancet study may have considerably overestimated Iraq War casualties, that the study made \"unusual\" methodological choices, and called on the 2006 Lancet study authors to make all of their data available. The 2008 study was awarded \"Article of the Year – 2008\" by the Journal of Peace Research, with the jury of Lars-Erik Cederman (ETH Zürich), Jon Hovi (University of Oslo) and Sara McLaughlin Mitchell (University of Iowa) writing that the \"authors show convincingly that previous studies which are based on a cross-street cluster-sampling algorithm (CSSA) have significantly overestimated the number of casualties in Iraq.\" American University political scientist Thomas Zeitzoff said the Journal of Peace Research study showed the Lancet study to be \"wildly inaccurate\" due to its reliance on information from biased samples. Michael Spagat criticized the 2006 Lancet study in a 2010 article for the journal Defence and Peace Economics. Spagat wrote that he found \"some evidence relating to data fabrication and falsification\" and \"this evidence suggests that this survey cannot be considered a reliable or valid contribution towards knowledge about the extent of mortality in Iraq since 2003\". Spagat also chided the Lancet study for \"ethical violations to the survey's respondents including endangerment, privacy breaches and violations in obtaining informed consent\". In a letter to the journal Science, Spagat said that the Lancet study had failed replication in a study by the WHO (the Iraq Family Health Survey). Spagat noted that the lead author of the 2006 study had been censured by the American Association for Public Opinion Research for \"repeatedly refusing to disclose the corresponding information for his survey\". The Iraq Family Health Survey published by WHO researchers in The New England Journal of Medicine found that the 2006 Lancet study results \"considerably overestimated the number of violent deaths\" and that the results are highly improbable. In comparing the two studies, peace researcher Kristine Eck of Uppsala University notes that the IFHS study which covered the same period as the Lancet survey \"was based on a much larger sample (9,345 households compared to Burnham et al's 1,849) in far more clusters (1,086 clusters compared to Burnham et al's 47).\" In comparing the two studies, Joachim Kreutz of Stockholm University and Nicholas Marsh of PRIO said the IFHS study produced \"a more reliable estimate.\" Oxford University political scientist Adam Roberts wrote that the IFHS study was \"more rigorous.\" Burnham, Edward J. Mills, and Frederick M. Burkle noted that the IFHS's data indicated that Iraqi mortality increased by a factor of 1.9 following the invasion, compared to the factor of 2.4 found by Burnham et al., which translates to some 433,000 excess Iraqi deaths (violent and non-violent). Timothy R. Gulden considered it implausible that fewer than one-third of these excess deaths would have been violent in nature. Francisco J. Luquero and Rebecca F. Grais argued that the IFHS's lengthy survey and use of IBC data as a proxy for particularly dangerous areas likely resulted in an underestimate of violent mortality, while Gulden hypothesized that respondents may have been reluctant to report violent deaths to researchers working with the Iraqi government. In a similar vein, Tirman observed that the Iraqi Health Ministry was affiliated with Shi'ite sectarians at the time, remarking that there was evidence that many violent deaths may have been recategorized as \"non-violent\" to avoid government retribution: \"For example, the number of deaths by auto accidents rose by four times the pre-invasion rate; had this single figure been included in the violent deaths category, the overall estimate would have risen to 196,000.\" Gulden even commented that \"the IFHS results are easily in line with the finding of more than 600,000 violent deaths in the study by Burnham et al.\" However, the authors of the IFHS rejected such claims: \"Because the level of underreporting is almost certainly higher for deaths in earlier time periods, we did not attempt to estimate excess deaths. The excess deaths reported by Burnham et al. included only 8.2% of deaths from nonviolent causes, so inclusion of these deaths will not increase the agreement between the estimates from the IFHS and Burnham et al.\" A graph in the Lancet article purportedly demonstrating that its conclusions are in line with violence trends measured by the IBC and Defense Department used cherry-picked data and had two Y-axes; the authors conceded that the graph was flawed, but the Lancet never retracted it. === Iraq Health Minister estimate (2006) === In early November 2006 Iraq's Health Minister Ali al-Shemari said that he estimated between 100,000 and 150,000 people had been killed since the March 2003 U.S.-led invasion.Todd, Robb S.

The Taipei Times reported on his methodology: \"Al-Shemari said on Thursday [, November 9, 2006,] that he based his figure on an estimate of 100 bodies per day brought to morgues and hospitals – though such a calculation would come out closer to 130,000 in total.\" The Washington Post reported: \"As al-Shemari issued the startling new estimate, the head of the Baghdad central morgue said Thursday he was receiving as many as 60 violent death victims each day at his facility alone.

These results were based on a survey of 1,499 adults in Iraq from August 12–19, 2007. ORB published an update in January 2008 based on additional work carried out in rural areas of Iraq. Some 600 additional interviews were undertaken and as a result of this the death estimate was revised to 1,033,000 with a given range of 946,000 to 1,120,000.\"Update on Iraqi Casualty Data\" by Opinion Research Business. January 2008.\"Revised Casualty Analysis. New Analysis 'Confirms' 1 Million+ Iraq Casualties\" . January 28, 2008. Opinion Research Business. Word Viewer for.doc files. Participants of the ORB survey were asked the following question: \"How many members of your household, if any, have died as a result of the conflict in Iraq since 2003 (ie as a result of violence rather than a natural death such as old age)? Please note that I mean those who were actually living under your roof.\" This ORB estimate has been strongly criticised as exaggerated and ill- founded in peer reviewed literature.\"Conflict Deaths in Iraq: A Methodological Critique of the ORB Survey Estimate\" By Michael Spagat and Josh Dougherty According to Carnegie Mellon University historian Jay D. Aronson, \"Because this was a number that few people could take seriously (given the incredible magnitude of violence that would have had to take place daily for such a number to be even remotely possible), the ORB study has largely been ignored.\" === Iraq Family Health Survey (IFHS, 2008) === The Iraq Family Health Survey published in 2008 in The New England Journal of Medicine surveyed 9,345 households across Iraq and was carried out in 2006 and 2007. It estimated 151,000 deaths due to violence (95% uncertainty range, 104,000 to 223,000) from March 2003 through June 2006. The study was done by the \"Iraq Family Health Survey Study Group\", a collaborative effort of six organizations: the Federal Ministry of Health, Baghdad; Kurdistan Ministry of Planning, Erbil; Kurdistan Ministry of Health, Erbil; Central Organization for Statistics and Information Technology, Baghdad; World Health Organization Iraq office, Amman, Jordan; World Health Organization, Geneva. === The Associated Press and Health Ministry (2009) === In April 2009, the Associated Press reported that Iraq Health Ministry had recorded (via death certificates issued by hospitals and morgues) a total of 87,215 violent deaths of Iraqi citizens between January 1, 2005, and February 28, 2009. The number excludes thousands of missing persons and civilians whose deaths were unrecorded; the government official who provided the data told the AP that if included, the number of dead for that period would be 10 to 20 percent higher. The Associated Press used the Health Ministry tally and other data (including counts of casualties for 2003–2004, and after March 1, 2009, from hospital sources and media reports, in major part the Iraq Body Count) to estimate that more than 110,600 Iraqis were killed from the start of the war to April 2009. Experts interviewed by the AP found this estimate to be credible and an \"important baseline\" although necessarily an estimate because of unrecorded deaths, especially in inaccessible areas. While mass graves discovered over time shed more light on deaths in the Iraq War, the AP noted that \"how many remain will never be known.\" === PLOS Medicine (2013) === A 2013 study by Hagopian et al. in PLOS Medicine estimated that 461,000 Iraqis died as a result of the Iraq War. The study used a similar methodology as the 2006 Lancet study and had the lead author of the 2006 study as one of the 12 authors. According to one of the authors, Amy Hagopian, half of the casualties not resulting from violence were due to inadequate treatment of cardiovascular disease. Upon the study's publication, Michael Spagat, a critic of the 2006 Lancet study, said that the 2013 study seemed \"to fix most of the methodological flaws of the 2006 paper\". Spagat however noted that he found the large confidence interval of the 2013 study disconcerting. Other critics of the 2006 Lancet study mirrored Spagat's views, noting that the 2013 study was an improvement but that the large confidence interval was concerning. A 2017 study by Spagat and Van Weezel replicated the 2013 study by Hagopian et al. and found that the 500,000 casualty estimate by Hagopian et al. was not supported by data. Spagat and Van Weezel said that Hagopian et al. made many methodological errors. Hagopian et al. defended their original study, arguing that Van Weezel and Spagat misunderstood their method. Van Weezel and Spagat answered, saying that the response by Hagopian et al. \"avoids the central points, addresses only secondary issues and makes ad hominem attacks.\" == Undercounting == Some studies estimating the casualties due to the war in Iraq say there are various reasons why the estimates and counts may be low. Morgue workers have alleged that official numbers underestimate the death toll. The bodies of some casualties do not end up in morgue and thus may go unrecorded.Cooney, Daniel (May 23, 2004). \"5,500 Iraqis Killed, Morgue Records Show\" . Associated Press (via The United Jerusalem Foundation). Retrieved September 3, 2010. (Article is here also (via the China Daily). Retrieved September 3, 2010.) In 2006, The Washington Post reported: \"Police and hospitals often give widely conflicting figures of those killed in major bombings. In addition, death figures are reported through multiple channels by government agencies that function with varying efficiency.\" A January 31, 2008 Perspective in the New England Journal of Medicine contains the following discussion of undercounting Iraqi civilian casualties in household surveys: The Washington Post noted in 2008 that > research has shown that household surveys typically miss 30 to 50 percent of > deaths.

The survey tallied violent deaths from May 1, 2003, when President Bush declared an end to major combat operations, through April 30, 2004. From the AP article: > In Baghdad, a city of about 5.6 million, 4,279 people were recorded killed > in the 12 months through April 30, [2004], according to figures provided by > Kais Hassan, director of statistics at Baghdad's Medicolegal Institute, > which administers the city's morgues. \"Before the war, there was a strong > government, strong security.

Also, the bodies of killed fighters from groups like the > al-Mahdi Army are rarely taken to morgues. Accidental trauma deaths from car accidents, falls, etc. are not included in the numbers. The article reports that the numbers translate to 76 killings per 100,000 people in Baghdad, compared to 39 in Bogotá, Colombia, 7.5 in New York City, and 2.4 in neighboring Jordan. The article states that there were 3.0 killings per 100,000 people in Baghdad in 2002 (the year before the war). Morgues surveyed in other parts of Iraq also reported large increases in the number of homicides.
