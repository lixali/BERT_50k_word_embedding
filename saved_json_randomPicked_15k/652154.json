 "text": "The Guildford Flames are an ice hockey team based in Guildford, Surrey and they play their home games in the Guildford Spectrum. They compete in the top- tier of hockey in the United Kingdom, the Elite Ice Hockey League. Founded in October 1992, the Flames originally played in the second tier leagues of British hockey, first the British National League until 2004, and subsequently the English Premier Ice Hockey League until 2017. On 24 February 2017 it was announced that the Flames would become the 12th Elite Ice Hockey League team, joining from the 2017–18 season. The team's head coach is Paul Dixon, who took over after Stan Marple retired in 2007. ==Formation== Barry Dow, an American who sponsored and owned the basketball team Guildford Kings and Bill Hurley established and owned the team as management – the two were new to the sport of ice hockey, and brought in Mike Urquhart as coach and Darrin Zinger as captain. Key players signed for the first season included Canadians Sean Murphy and Dave McGahan due to their high scoring at Solent Vikings. In addition a number of British players including goaltender, Mike Kellond; forward, Danny O'Hanlon and defender, Gary Shearer. The Flames' inaugural season began in October 1992; they began, unseeded, in the English League Division One. With the Guildford Spectrum not yet completed, the team had to train at Slough's facility. The Flames played their home games at Alexandra Palace until their new home ice was ready and played there for the first time on 23 January 1993. When 23 January 1993 finally arrived and the Guildford Spectrum opened, the event was a big one. The area's paid-for newspaper The Surrey Advertiser described the local council's £28 million arena as \"awesome\". Guildford's first game at their new home showed a convincing win with Andy Sparks scoring the first goal at the Spectrum. The team went to the top of the Conference due to that game, a position they held onto for the whole season. ===Elite League=== The Guildford Flames were confirmed as an Elite League expansion team in February 2017, stepping up from the English Premier Ice Hockey League (EPIHL), and began play in the UK's top division at the start of the 2017–18 EIHL season this was a promotion form the lower league. The Flames finished in sixth in their first season (2017–18), followed by a fifth placed finish in 2018–19 - a campaign in which they finished runners-up to the Belfast Giants in the Challenge Cup final. Guildford were again in sixth when the 2019–20 EIHL season's remaining matches were cancelled in March 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The play-offs were cancelled with only the Challenge Cup seeing a winner (the Sheffield Steelers) crowned. Then, the 2020–21 Elite League season - originally scheduled for a revised start date of 5 December - was suspended on 15 September 2020 because of ongoing coronavirus pandemic restrictions. The EIHL board determined that the season was non-viable without supporters being permitted to attend matches and unanimously agreed to a suspension. The season was cancelled completely in February 2021. ==Club honours== *Season 2018/19 **Patton Conference Champions **2018–19 EIHL All-Stars Second Team: Calle Ackered, Jesse Craige *Season 2017/18 **2017–18 EIHL All-Stars First Team: Jesse Craige **2017–18 EIHL All- Stars Second Team: Calle Ackered, John Dunbar *Season 2015/16 **English Premier Cup **English Premier League Playoff Winners *Season 2012/13 **English Premier League Champions **English Premier Cup *Season 2011/12 **English Premier League Champions **English Premier Cup *Season 2010/11 **English Premier League Playoff Winners *Season 2009/10 **English Premier Cup *Season 2007/08 **English Premier League Champions *Season 2006/07 **English Premier Cup *Season 2005/06 **English Premier League Champions *Season 2003/04 ** British National League Play-off Winners *Season 2000/01 ** Christmas Cup Winners ** British National League Champions ** British National League Play- off Winners *Season 1998/99 ** Benson & Hedges Plate Winners *Season 1997/98 ** British National League Southern Conference Winners ** British National League Winners ** British National League Play-off Winners *Season 1996/97 ** Benson & Hedges Plate Winners ==Team logo and jersey== right|The current team jerseys, for both away and home.
