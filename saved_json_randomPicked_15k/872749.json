 "text": "Agoraphobic Nosebleed (abbreviated as ANb) is an American grindcore band formed in 1994 in Springfield, Massachusetts, United States. Its line-up has changed often over the years, with guitarist and drum programmer Scott Hull being the only continuous member. The current line-up includes vocalist Jay Randall, and Richard Johnson of Enemy Soil and Drugs of Faith, along with John Jarvis of Pig Destroyer and Fulgora on bass guitar. Agoraphobic Nosebleed is one of the most well-known drum-machine grindcore bands, and has influenced many drum-machine grindcore bands. ==Biography== The band is known for the brevity of its songs. The album Altered States of America features 100 songs (including one hidden) in just under 22 minutes, with many songs of 5 seconds or less, and the longest song being only 1:45. Agoraphobic Nosebleed is also known for rarely playing live. The band played at the 2003 New England Metal and Hardcore Festival. As the band's appearance was unscheduled, Pig Destroyer cut its set short so Agoraphobic Nosebleed could play two songs and an intro. Twelve years later, the band finally played their first full live set at the 2015 edition of the Maryland Deathfest. Their second full live set was played on November 15, 2015, at the Housecore Horror Festival Part III in San Antonio, TX. In keeping with the band's aesthetic, no live drummer has been used at the performances. In 2006, Hydra Head Records reissued Agoraphobic Nosebleed's 6\" PCP Torpedo as a double disc set entitled PCP Torpedo/ANbRx. The first disc consists of the 10-song, 6-minute original EP. The second disc is over an hour's worth of remixes of songs from PCP Torpedo by breakcore and noise music artists such as Xanopticon, James Plotkin, Merzbow, and Justin Broadrick. In 2009, the band released the album Agorapocalypse on Relapse, available as a CD, LP, and longbox CD. The split 7-inch with Crom was released a month later. In 2010, the band released a split 7-inch with The Endless Blockade for Relapse Records and a split 5\" with A.N.S. for Tankcrimes Records. A split CD/LP with Despise You was released on Relapse in 2011. The December 2011 issue of Decibel Magazine included a flexi disc titled Make a Joyful Noise, and the December 2012 issue included a flexi disc containing the song \"Merry Chrystmeth\". Agoraphobic Nosebleed is recording four EPs, each written in the preferred style of a specific member. Kat Katz's EP, Arc, was released in 2016. Randall is currently working on Drum Machine Gun 2, as well as doing a collaborative 7-inch with Wadge and a collaborative 12-inch with Black Mayonnaise. On October 24, 2018, Kat Katz announced her departure from Agoraphobic Nosebleed due to \"being bullied by dudes\", with the band confirming it on their own Facebook page citing differences in band interactions. ==Personnel== ===Current members=== *Scott Hull (Pig Destroyer, ex-Anal Cunt, ex-Japanese Torture Comedy Hour) – guitar, drum programming *Jay Randall (ex-Isis, Japanese Torture Comedy Hour, Seal Team 666) – vocals, electronics *Richard Johnson (Enemy Soil, Drugs of Faith, Jesus of Nazareth) – vocals, formerly bass guitar *John Jarvis (ex-Pig Destroyer, Scour, Fulgora) – bass guitar ===Former members=== *Joe – vocals (1995–1996) *Dom – vocals (1995–1996) *Aaron Ulcer – vocals (1997) *Sean Wipfli – vocals (1997) *J.R.
