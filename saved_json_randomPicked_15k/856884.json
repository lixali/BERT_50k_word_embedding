The lighthouse at Ardnamurchan Point featured in an episode of the BBC TV series, Top Gear, as the destination of a race, where the drivers had to be first to the lighthouse and fit a new bulb. This was Series 30, episode 3. 'Gazing from Ardnamurchan Point to the Hebrides' is a poem composed by Leslie Wheeldon. It is in memory to his much loved wife Kitty.
