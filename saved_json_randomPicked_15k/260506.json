The population was 816 at the 2010 census. ==History== The name “Wonewoc” is of Indigenous American origin, probably meaning \"howling hills\". However, at the time of colonization, the site and subsequent town were known to the native Hoocąk (Winnebago) people as Wonį́wąk, which derives ultimately from an infinitive meaning, \"to be wicked, bad.\" However, Josephine White Eagle says that wōnį́wąk means more precisely, \"you (sg.) are naughty, foolish, not thinking.\" Apparently, a settler asked a native resident, \"What do you call this place?\" and the man replied, \"You're a knucklehead.\" George and Lucinda Willard first settled the area in 1851. The town was incorporated as a village in 1878, and once the railroad was built village growth exploded. The population of the town was largely settled by Yankee colonists from New England, according to the 1860 census. When the railroad era ended Wonewoc’s growth halted.
