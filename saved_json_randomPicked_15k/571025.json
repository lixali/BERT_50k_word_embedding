It is part of the State University of New York system. It offers 23 bachelor's degrees, 52 associate degrees, and three certificate programs, and is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. == Location == SUNY Morrisville is located in Central New York, southeast of Syracuse in the village of Morrisville, New York. Morrisville is adjacent to the towns of Cazenovia, to the west, and Hamilton, to the east. ==Research== ===Industrial hemp=== SUNY Morrisville was one of the first campuses to hold a license to grow industrial hemp for grain and fiber research applications. This research program is being led by Agronomy professor Dr. Gilbert Jenkins and Morrisville students. While Industrial Hemp is very responsive to nitrogen inputs in terms on increased grain production, at the same time, fiber quality may decrease with high N inputs. We are looking to develop a grain yield response curve for nitrogen fertilization, test a variety of fertilization timing options, and sources of N fertilizer to maximize grain production. Fiber quantity and quality will be measured to determine if it is possible to harvest high quality fiber from a dual purpose crop, or whether nitrogen recommendations are divergent for fiber and grain production purposes. Recently the college announced the creation of a cannabis industry minor. ===Seahorses=== SUNY Morrisville Aquatic Science and Aquaculture Program houses a breeding colony of Hippocampus erectus, the lined seahorse, and is currently working on experiments that address larval seahorse health and the conservation of seahorses. ===Biofuels === The New York State Senate awarded $4 million for the creation of the New York Center for Liquid Biofuels at SUNY Morrisville with a facility based in Cortland County.
