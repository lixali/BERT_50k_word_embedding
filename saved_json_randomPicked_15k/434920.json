 "text": "__NOTOC__ In mathematics the finite Fourier transform may refer to either *another name for discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) of a finite-length series. E.g., F.J.Harris (pp. 52–53) describes the finite Fourier transform as a \"continuous periodic function\" and the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) as \"a set of samples of the finite Fourier transform\". In actual implementation, that is not two separate steps; the DFT replaces the DTFT. So J.Cooley (pp. 77–78) describes the implementation as discrete finite Fourier transform. or * another name for the Fourier series coefficients. or * another name for one snapshot of a short-time Fourier transform. ==See also== * Fourier transform ==Notes== ==References== # * # ==Further reading== *Rabiner, Lawrence R.; Gold, Bernard (1975).
