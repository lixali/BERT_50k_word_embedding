 "text": "This is a list of all closed-circuit television and pay-per-view events held by World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and its predecessor Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP). From 1983–1987, these events aired live on closed-circuit television under the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) banner. Beginning in 1987, the events would air live on pay-per-view television. In November 1988, JCP sold its assets to the Turner Broadcasting System, which rebranded the company as World Championship Wrestling; they would later leave the NWA in 1991. In 1998 and early 1999, PPV events were promoted using the dual WCW/nWo brands. In 2001, the World Wrestling Federation (now known as WWE) purchased the assets of WCW, including the video libraries of all previous NWA and WCW pay-per-views, and the ownership rights of the names of these events. To date WWE has only promoted one pay-per-view event using the name of a former WCW PPV, The Great American Bash, from 2004 until 2009. In 2012, it was rebooted as a live SmackDown special and in 2020, it was used as a two-week show as part of the NXT brand followed in 2021 by a special episode on one night. Also in 2020, the Halloween Havoc event name would be revived, once again as a special episode of NXT. In 2017, WWE revived the Starrcade name for a non- televised house show and then would show a portion of the 2018 and 2019 iterations of the event on the WWE Network. Beginning in 2014, nearly all NWA and WCW pay-per-view events were made available on the WWE Network. ==NWA (Jim Crockett Promotions) closed-circuit television events== ===1983=== {| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\" ! width=8%| Date ! width=14%| Event ! width=14%| Venue ! width=14%| Location ! width=50%| Main event |- |November 24 |Starrcade |Greensboro Coliseum |Greensboro, North Carolina |Harley Race vs. Ric Flair |} ===1984=== {| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\" ! width=8%| Date ! width=14%| Event ! width=14%| Venue ! width=14%| Location ! width=50%| Main event |- |November 22 |Starrcade |Greensboro Coliseum |Greensboro, North Carolina |Ric Flair vs. Dusty Rhodes |} ===1985=== {| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\" ! width=8%| Date ! width=14%| Event ! width=14%| Venue ! width=14%| Location ! width=50%| Main event |- |July 6 |The Great American Bash |American Legion Memorial Stadium |Charlotte, North Carolina |Tully Blanchard vs. Dusty Rhodes |- |November 28 |Starrcade |Greensboro Coliseum The Omni |Greensboro, North Carolina Atlanta |Ric Flair vs. Dusty Rhodes |} ===1986=== {| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\" ! width=8%| Date ! width=14%| Event ! width=14%| Venue ! width=14%| Location ! width=50%| Main event |- |November 27 |Starrcade |Greensboro Coliseum The Omni |Greensboro, North Carolina Atlanta |Ric Flair vs. Nikita Koloff |} ==NWA (Jim Crockett Promotions) pay- per-view events== ===1987=== {| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\" ! width=8%| Date ! width=14%| Event ! width=14%| Venue ! width=14%| Location ! width=50%| Main event |- |November 26 |Starrcade |UIC Pavilion |Chicago |Ron Garvin vs. Ric Flair |} ===1988=== {| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\" ! width=8%| Date ! width=14%| Event ! width=14%| Venue ! width=14%| Location ! width=50%| Main event |- |January 24 |The Bunkhouse Stampede Finals |Nassau Coliseum |Uniondale, New York |Dusty Rhodes vs. Arn Anderson vs. The Barbarian vs. Tully Blanchard vs. Ivan Koloff vs. Lex Luger vs. Road Warrior Animal vs. The Warlord |- |July 10 |The Great American Bash |Baltimore Arena |Baltimore |Ric Flair vs. Lex Luger |} ==NWA (World Championship Wrestling) pay-per-view events== ===1988=== {| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\" ! width=8%| Date ! width=14%| Event ! width=14%| Venue ! width=14%| Location ! width=50%| Main event |- |December 26 |Starrcade |Norfolk Scope |Norfolk, Virginia |Ric Flair vs. Lex Luger |} ===1989=== {| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\" ! width=8%| Date ! width=14%| Event ! width=14%| Venue ! width=14%| Location ! width=50%| Main event |- |February 20 |Chi-Town Rumble |UIC Pavilion |Chicago |Ric Flair vs. Ricky Steamboat |- |May 7 |WrestleWar |Nashville Municipal Auditorium |Nashville, Tennessee |Ricky Steamboat vs. Ric Flair |- |July 23 |The Great American Bash |Baltimore Arena |Baltimore |Ric Flair vs. Terry Funk |- |October 28 |Halloween Havoc |Philadelphia Civic Center |Philadelphia |Ric Flair and Sting vs. The Great Muta and Terry Funk |- |December 13 |Starrcade |The Omni |Atlanta |Ric Flair vs. Sting |} ===1990=== {| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\" ! width=8%| Date ! width=14%| Event ! width=14%| Venue ! width=14%| Location ! width=50%| Main event |- |February 25 |WrestleWar |Greensboro Coliseum |Greensboro, North Carolina |Ric Flair vs. Lex Luger |- |May 19 |Capital Combat |D.C.
