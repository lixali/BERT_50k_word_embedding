 "text": "Laurier—Sainte-Marie is a federal electoral district in Downtown Montreal, Quebec, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1988. Its population in 2016 was 111,835. ==Geography== The district includes Côte Saint-Louis and the eastern parts of The Plateau and Mile End in the Borough of Le Plateau-Mont-Royal and the eastern part of Downtown Montreal and the western part of Centre-Sud (including part of the neighbourhood of Sainte-Marie) in the Borough of Ville-Marie. ==History== In 1987, the district of \"Laurier—Sainte-Marie\" was created from Laurier, Montreal—Sainte-Marie and Saint-Jacques ridings. In 2003, Laurier—Sainte-Marie was abolished when it was redistributed into Laurier and Hochelaga ridings. After the 2004 election, Laurier riding was renamed \"Laurier—Sainte-Marie\" in 2004. The name comes from Laurier Avenue, a street in Plateau Mont-Royal named after Wilfrid Laurier, and Sainte-Marie, a former name for Centre-Sud, which in turn came from a parish church dedicated to Saint Mary. The riding was represented by Gilles Duceppe, leader of the Bloc Québécois, until 2011 when he was defeated by Hélène Laverdière of the New Democratic Party. This riding lost territory to Outremont and Ville-Marie—Le Sud-Ouest—Île-des-Sœurs, and gained territory from Hochelaga, Westmount—Ville-Marie and Outremont during the 2012 electoral redistribution. ===Former boundaries=== Image:Laurier, riding.png|2004 to 2011 election ==Demographics== :According to the Canada 2006 Census Racial groups: 84.9% White, 3.6% Black, 2.9% Latin American, 2.1% Chinese, 1.8% Arab, 1.5% Southeast Asian, 1.4% South Asian Religions (2001): 68.5% Catholic, 2.8% Muslim, 2.8% Protestant, 1.4% Buddhist, 1.1% Christian Orthodox, 1.0% Other Christian, 21.0% No religion Average income: $25,079 :According to the Canada 2016 Census * Twenty most common mother tongue languages (2016) : 70.9% French, 10.4% English, 4.1% Spanish, 2.3% Arabic, 1.4% Mandarin, 1.2% Portuguese, 1.2% Cantonese, 0.9% Bengali, 0.7% Farsi, 0.7% Vietnamese, 0.6% Russian, 0.5% Italian, 0.4% German, 0.4% Romanian, 0.3% Creole languages, 0.3% Polish, 0.2% Greek, 0.2% Korean, 0.2% Japanese, 0.2% Turkish == Riding associations == Riding associations are the local branches of political parties: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" | Party | valign=\"top\" |Association name | valign=\"top\" |CEO | valign=\"top\" |HQ address |Laurier—Sainte-Marie EDA, CPC |Pierre Fontaine |1703 Létourneux |Laurier—Sainte-Marie Conservative Association |Bertrane Royer |4390 Rue de Mentana |Association du Parti Vert du Canada de Laurier—Sainte-Marie |Jamil Azzaoui |Montreal |Laurier—Sainte-Marie Federal Liberal Association |Sendanga Yeba |5323 Avenue de Lorimier |NDP Riding Association of Laurier—Sainte-Marie |Nicholas Trottier |312B-4821 Boulevard Saint-Laurent |} ==Members of Parliament== This riding has elected the following Members of Parliament: ==Election results== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! colspan=\"4\" | 2011 federal election redistributed resultsPundits' Guide to Canadian Elections |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"130px\" colspan=\"2\" | Party ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"50px\" | Vote ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"30px\" | % |- | | | New Democratic ||align=right| 23,749 ||align=right| 46.48 |- | | | Bloc Québécois ||align=right| 17,853 ||align=right| 34.94 |- | | | Liberal ||align=right| 5,451 ||align=right| 10.67 |- | | | Conservative ||align=right| 2,019 ||align=right| 3.95 |- | | | Green ||align=right| 1,348 ||align=right| 2.64 |- | | | Others ||align=right| 677 ||align=right| 1.32 |} ==See also== * List of Canadian federal electoral districts * Past Canadian electoral districts ==References== * ===Notes=== ==External links== Riding history from the Library of Parliament: *Laurier—Sainte-Marie (1987-2003), accessed 5 November 2006 *Laurier (2003-2004), accessed 5 November 2006 *Laurier—Sainte-Marie (2004-present), accessed 5 November 2006 Category:Federal electoral districts of Montreal Category:Ville-Marie, Montreal Category:Centre-Sud Category:Le Plateau-Mont-Royal Category:Quartier Latin, Montreal",
