 "text": "Perpignan (, , ; ; ; ) is the prefecture of the Pyrénées-Orientales department (known as Northern Catalonia) in southern France, in the heart of the plain of Roussillon, at the foot of the Pyrenees a few kilometres from the Mediterranean Sea and the scrublands of the Corbières massif. It is the centre of the Perpignan Méditerranée Métropole metropolitan area.INSEE commune file In 2016 Perpignan had a population of 121,875 (Perpignanais(e) in French, Perpinyanés(a) in Catalan) in the commune proper, and the metropolitan area had a total population of 268,577, making it the last major French city before the Spanish border. Perpignan is also sometimes seen as the \"Entrance\" of the Iberian Peninsula. Perpignan was the capital of the former province and County of Roussillon (Rosselló in Catalan) and continental capital of the Kingdom of Majorca in the 13th and 14th centuries. It has preserved an extensive old centre with its bodegas in the historic centre, coloured houses in a series of picturesque streets and alleys stretching between the banks of the Têt and its tributary, the Basse. The city is also known for its International Photojournalism Festival, its medieval Trobades and its centuries-old garnet industry. ==Geography== ===Location=== Perpignan is located in the center of the Roussillon plain, 13 km west of the Mediterranean coast. It is the southernmost of the cities of metropolitan France. File:Map commune FR insee code 66136.png|Map of Perpignan and its surrounding communes File:Perpignan Pyrenees-Orientales.png|Location within the Pyrénées-Orientales département. ===Hydrography=== Perpignan is crossed by the largest river in Roussillon, the Têt, and by one of its tributaries, the Basse. Floods have occurred, as in 1892 when the rising of the Têt in Perpignan destroyed 39 houses, leaving more than 60 families homeless. ===Climate=== Perpignan has a typical Mediterranean climate (Köppen Csa) similar to much of the Mediterranean coastline of France. One might expect rain to be rare in the city, but in fact the annual precipitation levels are similar to the national average. However, the city is known for its patchy rains, with weeks or even months of rain falling in a matter of hours, followed by weeks and weeks without a drop of water. Perpignan experiences very hot summers and fairly mild winters. For decades, there has been no snow most of the time and temperatures can reach 40 °C (104 °F). Most of the precipitation occurs in the cold season, with extremely dry summers. A fresh north-westerly wind often blows, the Tramontana (French: Tramontane, pronounced [tʁamɔ̃tan), keeping the sky clear much of the time, resulting in high annual sunshine. But the presence of this wind makes winters colder than they should be from the geographical position of the city. ===Transport=== ;Roads The A9 motorway connects Perpignan with Barcelona and Montpellier. ;Trains Perpignan is served by the Gare de Perpignan railway station, which offers connections to Paris, Barcelona, Toulouse, and several regional destinations. Salvador Dalí proclaimed the station to be the \"Cosmic Centre of the Universe\" after experiencing a vision of cosmogonic ecstasy there in 1963. ;Airport The nearest airport is Perpignan–Rivesaltes Airport. ==Toponymy== ;Attested forms The name of Perpignan appears in 927 as Perpinianum, followed in 959 by Villa Perpiniano, Pirpinianum in the 11th century, Perpiniani in 1176. Perpenyà, which appears in the 13th century, is the most common form until the 15th century, and was still used in the 17th century. It probably derives from the Roman name Perpennius. ==History== thumb|Perpignan c. 1780 Though settlement in the area goes back to Roman times, the medieval town of Perpignan seems to have been founded around the beginning of the 10th century. Shortly afterwards, Perpignan became the capital of the counts of Roussillon. Historically, it was part of the region known as Septimania. In 1172 Count Girard II bequeathed his lands to the Counts of Barcelona. Perpignan acquired the institutions of a partly self- governing commune in 1197. French feudal rights over Roussillon were given up by Louis IX in the Treaty of Corbeil. When James I the Conqueror, king of Aragon and count of Barcelona, founded the Kingdom of Majorca in 1276, Perpignan became the capital of the mainland territories of the new state. The succeeding decades are considered the golden age in the history of the city. It prospered as a centre of cloth manufacture, leather work, goldsmiths' work, and other luxury crafts. King Philippe III of France died there in 1285, as he was returning from his unsuccessful crusade against the Aragonese Crown. thumb|Perpignan c. 1905 In 1344 Peter IV of Aragon annexed the Kingdom of Majorca and Perpignan once more became part of the County of Barcelona. A few years later it lost approximately half of its population to the Black Death. It was attacked and occupied by Louis XI of France in 1463; a violent uprising against French rule in 1473 was harshly put down after a long siege, but in 1493 Charles VIII of France, wishing to conciliate Castile in order to free himself to invade Italy, restored it to Ferdinand II of Aragon. Again besieged and captured by the French during the Thirty Years' War in September 1642, Perpignan was formally ceded by Spain 17 years later in the Treaty of the Pyrenees, and thereafter remained a French possession. In June 2020, it was reported that the National Rally's Louis Aliot won the mayor election in Perpignan. it would be the first time that the Marine Le Pen's party has won a city of more than 100,000 people. ==Government and politics== ===Mayors=== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !

They play at the Stade Aimé Giral. A Perpignan-based rugby league club plays in British Super League under the name Catalans Dragons. The Dragons' games in Perpignan against the Northern English-based sides are usually very popular with British rugby fans, with thousands of them descending on the city on the day of the game, including many vacationing rugby fans travelling up from the Spanish Costa Brava joining the ones who came directly from home. The club was founded in 2000 as the merger of XIII Catalan with nearby neighbours AS Saint Estève to form Union Treiziste Catalane. The club is based at Stade Gilbert Brutus. The youth teams reformed as Saint-Estève XIII Mavericks, while a French top league semi-professional club was retained under the name Saint-Estève XIII Catalan; both play at the Stade Municipal in the in Saint-Estève suburb. The local association football team is Canet Roussillon FC, there is also an Australian rules football club Perpignan Tigers and American football club Grizzlys Catalans. The Roussillon Grand Prix was a Grand Prix motor racing event that was held between 1946 and 1949 in the streets of Perpignan. ==Economy== Traditional commerce was in wine, olive oil, corks (the cork oak Quercus suber grows in Perpignan's mild climate), wool, leather, and iron. In May 1907 it was a seat of agitation by southern producers for government enforcement of wine quality following a collapse in prices. JOB rolling papers are currently manufactured in Perpignan. ==Sites of interest== The Cathedral of St. John the Baptist was begun in 1324 and finished in 1509. The 13th century Palace of the Kings of Majorca sits on the high citadel, surrounded by ramparts, reinforced for Louis XI and Charles V, which were updated in the 17th century by Louis XIV's military engineer Vauban. The walls surrounding the town, which had been designed by Vauban, were razed in 1904 to accommodate urban development. The main city door, the Castillet is a small fortress built in the 14th century, which has been preserved. It had also been used as a prison until the end of the 19th century. The Hôtel Pams is a lavishly- decorated mansion designed for Jules Pams that illustrates the artistic taste of the wealthy bourgeois at the turn of the 20th century. Les Halles de Vauban are a new addition to the banks of the city's canal. Opened in November 2017 the indoor markets are privately owned and cost €1.5 million. Split into two locations, vendors offer fresh fruit and vegetables, bread, flowers, cheese, etc. There is a bar and central eating court with a range of tapas, burgers, omelettes and food from around the world. thumb|left|1000px|Place de la République and theatre thumb|left|1000px|Sadi Carnot and Vauban walkways and the river Bassa ==Notable people linked to Perpignan== * Paul Alday (c.1763–1835), violinist, composer, and music publisher * Anna Maria Antigó (1602–1676), abbess * François Arago (1786–1853), physicist, astronomer, and liberal politician * Alexandre Artus (1821–1911), composer and conductor * Amédée Artus (1815–1892), composer and conductor * Frédérick Bousquet (born 1981), freestyle and butterfly swimmer * Robert Brasillach (1909–1945), fascist author and journalist * Eugène Collache (1847–1883), French Navy officer who fought in Japan * Mary Elmes (1908–2002), Irish aid worker * François de Fossa (1775–1849), classical guitarist and composer * Jean-Luc Escayol (born 1972), footballer * Jacques-François Gallay (1795– 1864), French horn player and composer * Philippe Georget (born 1962), novelist * Louise Labé (1524–1566), Lyons poet of the Renaissance * Aristide Maillol (1861–1944), sculptor and painter * André Marty (1886–1956), communist leader * Menachem Meiri (1249–c.1310), Catalan rabbi, Talmudist, and Maimonidean * Isabelle Pasco (born 1966), actress * Hyacinthe Rigaud (1659–1743), painter Following a visit in 1963, the Catalan surrealist artist Salvador Dalí declared the city's railway station the centre of the Universe, saying that he always got his best ideas sitting in its waiting room. Dalí's painting La Gare de Perpignan commemorates his vision of \"cosmogonic ecstasy\" there on 19 September 1963. He followed that up some years later by declaring that the Iberian Peninsula rotated precisely at Perpignan station 132 million years ago – an event the artist invoked in his 1983 painting Topological Abduction of Europe – Homage to René Thom.Elliott King in Dawn Adès (ed.), Dalí, Bompiani Arte, Milan, 2004, p. 448. Above the station is a monument in Dali's honour, and across the surface of one of the main platforms is painted, in big letters, «perpignan centre du monde» (French for \"perpignan centre of the world\"). thumb|Perpignan train station ==Gallery== Perpignan Castillet 1.jpg|Le Castillet Perpignanrivierebasse.jpg|Bridge over river Basse Font sirenes Perpinya.jpg|Mermaids fountain 086 Perpignan Rue.JPG|City centre Le cinéma art nouveau \"le Castillet\" (Perpignan) (8846519405).jpg|Cinéma Le Castillet ChateauRoussillon Tour.jpg|Château Roussillon: tower of the old castle (13th and 14th centuries) ChateauRoussillon ChapelleStPierre 01.jpg|Château Roussillon: Sainte-Marie and Saint-Pierre chapel (11th and 12th centuries) 087 Perpignan La Loge de Mer -1397, agrandi au XVIème-.JPG 088 Perpignan Cathédrale Saint-Jean.JPG|Cathédrale Saint-Jean Perpignan- Cathedrale-02.JPG|Perpignan Cathedral Lycée françois arago.jpeg|François Arago Lyceum Photo panoramique de la cathédrale de perpignan.jpg|Panoramic view of the Perpignan Cathedral Palaisdesrois.jpg|Palace of the King of Mallorca Perpignan bridge.JPG|The bridge ==See also== *Communes of the Pyrénées- Orientales department ==References== ==Bibliography== * *Alícia Marcet, Histoire de Perpignan, la fidelíssima (1995), Perpinyà [Perpignan] : Llibres del Trabucaire, ==External links== *City council website *History of Perpignan *Perpignan Tourist Office *Museum guide *Unofficial guide to Perpignan Airport *Companie Transports – Public Bus System Category:Communes of Pyrénées- Orientales Category:Cities in Occitanie Category:Capitals of former nations Category:Northern Catalonia Category:Prefectures in France Category:Vauban fortifications in France",
