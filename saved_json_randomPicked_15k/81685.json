 "text": "In Greco-Roman mythology, Leuce, also spelled Leuke, (, \"White\", specifically \"White Poplar\") was a nymph and a daughter of the Titan Oceanus. Hades fell in love with her and abducted her to the underworld. She lived out the span of her life in his realm, and when she died, the god turned her into a white poplar which he placed in the Elysian Fields. To celebrate his return from the underworld, the hero Heracles crowned himself with a branch of this tree.Servius, note to Eclogue 7.61: Leuce, Oceani filia, inter nymphas pulcherrima fuit. hanc Pluton adamavit et ad inferos rapuit. quae postquam apud eum completo vitae suae tempore mortua est, Pluton tam in amoris, quam in memoriae solacium in Elysiis piorum campis leucen nasci arborem iussit, ex qua, sicut dictum est, Hercules se, revertens ab inferis, coronavit. ==Mythology of the poplar== thumb|left|The two sides of the white poplar leaf Maurus Servius Honoratus identifies the tree as the white poplar, the leaf of which is distinctively two-sided, one white and one dark. The double color, Servius says, made a wreath that represented the duality of the hero's labors in both the upper and the underworld.Qua corona usus, duplici colore foliorum geminos labores (superorum) inferorumque testatus est. See also Isidore of Seville, Etymologiae 17.4.45: \"The white poplar is named because its leaves are white on one side and green on the other. It is therefore two-colored, having marks as if of day and night, which correspond to the times of the rising and setting of the sun\" (translation by Priscilla Throop). The association of white poplar leaves with Herakles is also attested by archaeological remains, such as the poplar-leaf motif carved on a statue base found in a small sanctuary to Herakles (Roman Hercules) along the Tiber river.Paul Zanker, The Power of Images in the Age of Augustus (University of Michigan Press, 1988, 199), p. 118 It has been suggestedDavid Evans, \"Dodona, Dodola, and Daedala,\" in Myth in Indo-European Antiquity (University of California Press, 1974), p. 116. that behind the vague outlines of this tale lurks an older myth having to do with Herakles' encounter with the river deity Achelous, who had chthonic associations and whose name was the subject of speculative theological etymology among the Greeks, in this case involving acherōïs, another Greek word for \"poplar.\" In a founding myth of the 1st century BC, Herakles is supposed to have established the Arvernian oppidum of Alesia,Diodorus Siculus 4.19; Nico Roymans, Ethnic Identity and Imperial Powers: The Batavians in the Early Roman Empire (Amsterdam University Press, 2004), p. 241. the name of which likely derives from the Gaulish word for poplar.Entry on \"Alder,\" Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture (Taylor & Francis, 1997), p. 11; Xavier Delamarre, Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise (Éditions Errance, 2003). Celebrants of the Bacchic rites wore a wreath of poplar leaves to honor the chthonic aspect of Dionysus.Alberto Bernabé and Ana Isabel Jiménez San Cristóbal, Instructions for the Netherworld: The Orphic Gold Tablets (Brill, 2008), pp. 93 and 125, citing Harpocration. At Elis, white poplar was the only wood used in sacrifices to Zeus, according to Pausanias, because Herakles imported the tree and used it to burn the thigh bones of sacrificial victims at Olympia. The oak is the customary sacred tree of Zeus, and the substitution among the Eleans may simply reflect the more widespread growth habit of the poplar there.Evans, \"Dodona, Dodola, and Daedala,\" p. 114, citing Arthur Bernard Cook, \"Zeus, Jupiter, and the Oak,\" Classical Review 17 (1903), p. 273. The hero was supposed to have discovered the tree growing on the banks of the upperworld Acheron in Thesprotia. Pausanias says this is the reason for the Homeric epithet Acherōïda for the white poplar,Pausanias, Description of Greece 5.14.2; Iliad 13.389, and 16.482. See also Servius, note to Eclogue 7.61, on Acherōïda, where the underworld river seems meant. The English Renaissance poet Edmund Spenser alludes in The Faerie Queene (Book 2, Canto V, stanza 31) to an association of \"Olympick Jove\" and the white poplar instead of his conventional oak. which was also called leukē in Greek.Arthur Calvert, P. Vergili Maronis. Aeneidos Liber V (Cambridge University Press, 1879), p. 48. The white poplar might be worn as a crown at athletic contests in honor of Herakles, a patron of the Olympic games. Its infernal origin made it appropriate for funeral games,Calvert, P. Vergili Maronis. Aeneidos Liber V, p. 48. which played an important role in the development of Greek athletics.Donald G. Kyle, Athletics in Ancient Athens (Brill, 1987, 1993), pp. 10–15. The white poplar was also sacred to Persephone, for whom Leuce seems to be a doublet or epithet, as a goddess of regeneration. Robert Graves used the myth of Leuce in developing his poetic theories of mythology. Graves, for instance, holds that the back of the poplar leaf was turned white by the sweat of Herakles.Robert Graves, (1955). The Greek Myths I (London: Penguin, 1955, revised edition 1960), pp. 121, 124-125, and The Greek Myths II, p. 154. In The White Goddess, he names the white poplar as one of the \"three trees of resurrection\", along with alder and cypress.Robert Graves, The White Goddess: A Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth (New York, 1948, 1975, 1999 printing), p. 171. The basis for Graves' assertion that Herakles bound his head with white poplar after killing Cacus (p. 193) is unclear. == References == Category:Nymphs Category:Metamorphoses in Greek mythology Category:Trees in mythology Category:Metamorphoses into trees in Greek mythology Category:Women of Hades Category:Characters in Greek mythology Category:Oceanids",
