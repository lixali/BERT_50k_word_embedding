During the First Jewish–Roman War, the Roman proconsul of Syria, Cestius Gallus, razed the town on his way to Jerusalem in 66 CE. It was occupied by Emperor Vespasian in 68 CE.Michael Avi-Yonah, s.v. \"Lydda,\" Encyclopaedia Judaica. In the period following the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE, Rabbi Tarfon, who appears in many Tannaitic and Jewish legal discussions, served as a rabbinic authority in Lod. During the Kitos War, 115–117 CE, the Roman army laid siege to Lod, where the rebel Jews had gathered under the leadership of Julian and Pappos. Torah study was outlawed by the Romans and pursued mostly in the underground.Holder, 1986, p. 52 The distress became so great, the patriarch Rabban Gamaliel II, who was shut up there and died soon afterwards, permitted fasting on Ḥanukkah. Other rabbis disagreed with this ruling.Ta'anit ii. 10; Yer. Ta'anit ii. 66a; Yer. Meg. i. 70d; R.

The name Diospolis (\"City of Zeus\") may have been bestowed earlier, possibly by Hadrian.Smallwood, 2001, p. 241 At that point, most of its inhabitants were Christian. The earliest known bishop is Aëtius, a friend of Arius. ===Byzantine period=== In December 415, the Council of Diospolis was held here to try Pelagius; he was acquitted.

An isolated large building with a semicircular colonnaded plaza in front of it might represent the St George shrine. ===Early Muslim period=== thumb|Khan el- Hilu, Lod After the Muslim conquest of Palestine by Amr ibn al-'As in 636 CE,Le Strange, 1890, p. 28 Lod which was referred to as \"al-Ludd\" in Arabic served as the capital of Jund Filastin (\"Military District of Palaestina\") before the seat of power was moved to nearby Ramla during the reign of the Umayyad Caliph Suleiman ibn Abd al-Malik in 715–716. The population of al-Ludd was relocated to Ramla, as well.Le Strange, 1890, p. 303 With the relocation of its inhabitants and the construction of the White Mosque in Ramla, al-Ludd lost its importance and fell into decay.Le Strange, 1890, p. 308 The city was visited by the local Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi in 985, when it was under the Fatimid Caliphate, and was noted for its Great Mosque which served the residents of al-Ludd, Ramla, and the nearby villages. He also wrote of the city's \"wonderful church (of St. George) at the gate of which Christ will slay the Antichrist.\"Le Strange, 1890 p. 493 ===Crusader and Ayyubid period=== The Crusaders occupied the city in 1099 and named it St. Jorge de Lidde. It was briefly conquered by Saladin, but retaken by the Crusaders in 1191. For the English Crusaders, it was a place of great significance as the birthplace of Saint George. The Crusaders made it the seat of a Latin rite diocese, and it remains a titular see.Lydda Catholic-hierarchy.org It owed the service of 10 knights and 20 sergeants, and it had its own burgess court during this era.Pringle, 1998, p. 11 In 1226, Ayyubid Syrian geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi visited al-Ludd and stated it was part of the Jerusalem District during Ayyubid rule.Le Strange, 1890, p. 494 ===Mamluk period=== Sultan Baybars brought Lydda again under Muslim control by 1267–8.Petersen, 2001, p. 203 According to Qalqashandi, Lydda was an administrative centre of a wilaya during the fourteenth and fifteenth century in the Mamluk empire. Mujir al-Din described it as a pleasant village with an active Friday mosque.Moudjir ed- dyn, 1876, Sauvaire (translation), pp. 210-213 During this time, Lydda was a station on the postal route between Cairo and Damascus.al-Ẓāhirī, 1894, pp. 118-119 ===Ottoman period=== thumb|Lod, between 1890 and 1900 right|thumb|Lydda, 1903 In 1517, Lydda was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire as part of the Damascus Eyalet, and in the 1550s, the revenues of Lydda were designated for the new waqf of Hasseki Sultan Imaret in Jerusalem, established by Hasseki Hurrem Sultan (Roxelana), the wife of Suleiman the Magnificent.Singer, 2002, p.49 By 1596 Lydda was a part of the nahiya (\"subdistrict\") of Ramla, which was under the administration of the liwa (\"district\") of Gaza. It had a population of 241 households and 14 bachelors who were all Muslims, and 233 households who were Christians.Petersen, 2005, p. 131 They paid a fixed tax-rate of 33,3 % on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, vineyards, fruit trees, sesame, special product (\"dawalib\" =spinning wheels), goats and beehives, in addition to occasional revenues and market toll, a total of 45,000 Akçe. All of the revenue went to the Waqf.Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 154 The village appeared as Lydda, though misplaced, on the map of Pierre Jacotin compiled in 1799.Karmon, 1960, p. 171 The missionary Dr. William M. Thomson visited Lydda in the mid-19th century, describing it as a \"flourishing village of some 2,000 inhabitants, imbosomed in noble orchards of olive, fig, pomegranate, mulberry, sycamore, and other trees, surrounded every way by a very fertile neighbourhood. The inhabitants are evidently industrious and thriving, and the whole country between this and Ramleh is fast being filled up with their flourishing orchards. Rarely have I beheld a rural scene more delightful than this presented in early harvest ... It must be seen, heard, and enjoyed to be appreciated.\"Thomson, 1859, pp. 292-3 In 1869, the population of Ludd was given as: 55 Catholics, 1,940 \"Greeks\", 5 Protestants and 4,850 Muslims. In 1870, the Church of Saint George was rebuilt. In 1892, the first railway station in the entire region was established in the city.Shahin, 2005, p. 260 In the second half of the 19th century, Jewish merchants migrated to the city, but left after the 1921 Jaffa riots. In 1882, the Palestine Exploration Fund's Survey of Western Palestine described Lod as \"A small town, standing among enclosure of prickly pear, and having fine olive groves around it, especially to the south. The minaret of the mosque is a very conspicuous object over the whole of the plain. The inhabitants are principally Moslim, though the place is the seat of a Greek bishop resident of Jerusalem. The Crusading church has lately been restored, and is used by the Greeks. Wells are found in the gardens....\"Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 252 ===British Mandate=== thumb|Lydda 1920 right|thumb|Lydda, 1932 From 1918, Lydda was under the administration of the British Mandate in Palestine, as per a League of Nations decree that followed the Great War. During the Second World War, the British set up supply posts in and around Lydda and its railway station, also building an airport that was renamed Ben Gurion Airport after the death of Israel's first prime minister in 1973. At the time of the 1922 census of Palestine, Lydda had a population of 8,103 inhabitants; 7,166 Muslims, 11 Jews and 926 Christians,Barron, 1923, Table VII, p. 21 the Christians were 921 Orthodox, 4 Roman Catholics and 1 Melkite.Barron, 1923, Table XIV, p. 46 This had increased by the 1931 census to 11,250; 10,002 Muslims, 28 Jews, 1,210 Christians and 10 Bahai, in a total of 2475 residential houses.Mills, 1932, p. 21 In 1945 Lydda had a population of 16,780; 14,910 Muslims, 1,840 Christians, 20 Jews and 10 classified as \"other\".Department of Statistics, 1945, p. 30 Until 1948, Lydda was an Arab town with a population of around 20,000—18,500 Muslims and 1,500 Christians.\"Lod,\" 2 January 1949, IS archive Gimel/5/297 in Yacobi, 2009, p. 31. In 1947, the United Nations proposed dividing Mandatory Palestine into two states, one Jewish state and one Arab; Lydda was to form part of the proposed Arab state.Sa'di and Abu-Lughod, 2007, pp. 91-92. In the ensuing war, Israel captured Arab towns outside the area the UN had allotted it, including Lydda. ===State of Israel=== ====1948 War==== The Israel Defense Forces entered Lydda on 11 July 1948.For one account, interspersed with interviews with IDF soldiers, see Ari Shavit, My Promised Land: The Triumph and Tragedy of Israel. New York: Spiegel & Grau, 2013, pp. 99–132. The following day, under the impression that it was under attack,Tal, 2004, p. 311. the 3rd Battalion was ordered to shoot anyone \"seen on the streets\". According to Israel, 250 Arabs were killed. Other estimates are higher: Arab historian Aref al Aref estimated 400, and Nimr al Khatib 1,700.Sefer Hapalmah ii (The Book of the Palmah), p. 565; and KMA-PA (Kibbutz Meuhad Archives – Palmah Archive). Quoted in Benny Morris, The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947–1949. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1987.Morris, 2004, p. 205 Morris writes: \"[...] dozens of unarmed detainees in the mosque and church in the centre of the town were shot and killed.\" During 1948, the population rose to 50,000 people as Arab refugees fleeing other areas made their way there.

See also Yitzhak Rabin's diaries, quoted here .Holmes et al., 2001, p. 64. The town was subsequently sacked by the Israeli army.Morris, Benny \"Operation Dani and the Palestinian Exodus from Lydda and Ramle in 1948,\" Middle East Journal 40 (1986) p. 88. A disputed claim, advanced by scholars including Ilan Pappé, characterizes this as ethnic cleansing.For the use of the term \"ethnic cleansing,\" see, for example, Pappé 2006. *On whether what occurred in Lydda and Ramle constituted ethnic cleansing: * Morris 2008, p. 408: \"although an atmosphere of what would later be called ethnic cleansing prevailed during critical months, transfer never became a general or declared Zionist policy. Thus, by war's end, even though much of the country had been 'cleansed' of Arabs, other parts of the country—notably central Galilee—were left with substantial Muslim Arab populations, and towns in the heart of the Jewish coastal strip, Haifa and Jaffa, were left with an Arab minority.\" *Spangler 2015, p. 156: \"During the Nakba, the 1947 [sic] displacement of Palestinians, Rabin had been second in command over Operation Dani, the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian towns of towns of Lydda and Ramle.\" *Schwartzwald 2012, p. 63: \"The facts do not bear out this contention [of ethnic cleansing]. To be sure, some refugees were forced to flee: fifty thousand were expelled from the strategically located towns of Lydda and Ramle ... But these were the exceptions, not the rule, and ethnic cleansing had nothing to do with it.\" *Golani and Manna 2011, p. 107: \"The expulsion of some 50,000 Palestinians from their homes ... was one of the most visible atrocities stemming from Israel's policy of ethnic cleansing.\" The few hundred Arabs who remained in the city were not permitted to live in their own homes. They were soon outnumbered by the influx of Jewish refugees who moved into the town from August 1948 onwards, most of them from Arab countries. as a result of which Lydda became a predominantly Jewish town.Monterescu and Rabinowitz, 2012, pp. 16-17.Yacobi, 2009, p. 29.

New upscale neighbourhoods are expanding the city to the east, among them Ganei Ya'ar and Ahisemah.Ganei Ya'ar in Lod The Jerusalem Post, 7 February 2008 According to the Economist, a three-meter-high wall was erected in 2010 to separate Jewish and Arab neighbourhoods, and limits have been imposed on Arab building, whereas construction in the Jewish areas is promoted. Some municipal services, such as street lighting and rubbish collection, are only provided to Jewish areas. Violent crime in the Arab neighbourhoods of Lod is largely directed at other Arabs and revolves around family feuds over turf and honour crimes.Pulled Apart. The Economist. 2010-10-14.

According to Jacob Fisch, executive director of the Friends of the Israel Antiquities Authority, a worker at the construction site noticed the tail of a tiger and halted work. The mosaic was initially covered over with soil at the conclusion of the excavation for lack of funds to conserve and develop the site. The mosaic is now part of the Lod Mosaic Archaeological Center. The Lod Community Archaeology Program, which operates in ten Lod schools, five Jewish and five Israeli Arab, combines archaeological studies with participation in digs in Lod. ==Sports== The city's major football club, Hapoel Bnei Lod, plays in Liga Leumit (the second division). Its home is at the Lod Municipal Stadium. The club was formed by a merger of Bnei Lod and Rakevet Lod in the 1980s. Two other clubs in the city play in the regional leagues: Hapoel MS Ortodoxim Lod in Liga Bet and Maccabi Lod in Liga Gimel. Hapoel Lod played in the top division during the 1960s and 1980s, and won the State Cup in 1984. The club folded in 2002.
