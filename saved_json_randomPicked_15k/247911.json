 "text": "The Longdendale Trail is an English long-distance rail trail following the former Woodhead railway line, which ran between Manchester and Sheffield and closed east of Hadfield in 1981. It has shallow gradients and a smooth surface that makes it popular with families and cyclists. The trail, which opened in May 1992, forms part of the longer Trans Pennine Trail, NCR 62, that runs from coast to coast across the UK (Liverpool to Hull). This in turn is part of the E8 European long distance path, which runs for from Cork in Ireland to Istanbul in Turkey. ==See also== * Rail trail ==External links== Category:Footpaths in Derbyshire Category:Tourist attractions of the Peak District Category:Rail trails in England Category:Long-distance footpaths in England",
