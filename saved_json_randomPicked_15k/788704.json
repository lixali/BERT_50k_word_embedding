 "text": "In propositional logic, conjunction elimination (also called and elimination, ∧ elimination, Sect.3.1.2.1, p.46 or simplification)Copi and CohenMoore and ParkerHurley is a valid immediate inference, argument form and rule of inference which makes the inference that, if the conjunction A and B is true, then A is true, and B is true. The rule makes it possible to shorten longer proofs by deriving one of the conjuncts of a conjunction on a line by itself. An example in English: :It's raining and it's pouring. :Therefore it's raining. The rule consists of two separate sub-rules, which can be expressed in formal language as: :\\frac{P \\land Q}{\\therefore P} and :\\frac{P \\land Q}{\\therefore Q} The two sub-rules together mean that, whenever an instance of \"P \\land Q\" appears on a line of a proof, either \"P\" or \"Q\" can be placed on a subsequent line by itself. The above example in English is an application of the first sub-rule. == Formal notation == The conjunction elimination sub- rules may be written in sequent notation: : (P \\land Q) \\vdash P and : (P \\land Q) \\vdash Q where \\vdash is a metalogical symbol meaning that P is a syntactic consequence of P \\land Q and Q is also a syntactic consequence of P \\land Q in logical system; and expressed as truth-functional tautologies or theorems of propositional logic: :(P \\land Q) \\to P and :(P \\land Q) \\to Q where P and Q are propositions expressed in some formal system. == References == Category:Rules of inference Category:Theorems in propositional logic sv:Matematiskt uttryck#Förenkling",
