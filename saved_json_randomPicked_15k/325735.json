After Swietopelk's death, his lands were occupied by the Saxon prince Lothar of Supplinburg. In 1155, the lands regained independence under Sobieslaw I, who founded the dynasty of the Samborides, and the Duchy of Pomerelia. ==Duchy of Pomerania== The Duchy resulted from the partition of Świętobor, Duke of Pomerania, in which his son Wartislaw inherited the lands that would become in fact known as Pomerania. ===Partitions of Pomerania=== ====First partition 1155–1264==== In 1155, Pomerania was divided in Pomerania-Stettin and Pomerania-Demmin. In the struggle to shake off Polish and Danish claims to feudal overlordship, Pomerania approached the Holy Roman Empire. In 1181, while staying in the camp outside the walls of Lübeck, Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa recognised Bogislaw I as duke of S(c)lavia, as it was called in the document.Julius Ficker, Vom Reichsfuerstenstande: Forschungen zur Geschichte des Reichsverfassung zunächst im XII. und XIII. Jahrhunderte: 2 vols. in 4 pts., Innsbruck: Verlag der Wagner'schen Buchhandlung, 1861, vol. 1, p. 70. However, three years later in the Battle in the Bay of Greifswald (1184) the Danish Canute VI forced Pomerania to accept him as liege lord.Hartmut Boockmann, „Barbarossa in Lübeck“, in: Zeitschrift des Vereins für Lübeckische Geschichte und Altertumskunde, vol. 61 (1981), pp. 7-18, here p. 18. In 1190 the Land of Słupsk-Sławno separated itself from Stettin. With the defeat of Denmark in the Battle of Bornhöved (1227) Pomerania shook off the Danish liege-lordship.Erich Hoffmann, „Die Bedeutung der Schlacht von Bornhöved für die deutsche und skandinavische Geschichte“, in: Zeitschrift des Vereins für Lübeckische Geschichte und Altertumskunde, vol. 57 (1977), pp. 9-37, here p. 15. In 1231 Emperor Frederick II granted the immediate liege lordship over Pomerania to the Margrave of Brandenburg, who enforced this claim by the Treaties of Kremmen (1236) and of Landin (1250). Thus Pomerania had become a fief of Brandenburg, thus an only mediate (indirect) subfief of the Empire, with Brandenburg itself being an immediate imperial fief. In 1227, Stolp came to Pomerelia, Schlawe to Pomerania. In 1238–1316 both became part of Pomerelia, ruled by an autonomously acting dynasty of castellans, the Swenzones (, entering history in 1257 with Swenzo the Elder). In 1316, the area became part of the Pomerania-Wolgast, first as a pawn from Brandenburg, and definitively in 1347. After Wartislaw III died heirless in 1264, Barnim I became sole duke of the whole duchy. After Barnim's death, the duchy was to be ruled by his sons Barnim II, Otto I and Bogislaw IV. The first years, Bogislaw, being the eldest, ruled in place of his too young brothers. ====Second partition 1295–1368==== In 1295, the Duchy of Pomerania was divided roughly by the Peene and Ina (Ihna) rivers, with the areas north of these rivers ruled by Bogislaw IV became Pomerania-Wolgast, whereas Otto I received Pomerania-Szczecin south of these rivers. ====Third partition 1368–1376==== In 1368, Pomerania-Wolgast was divided into a western part (German: Wolgast diesseits der Swine, including the name-giving residence in Wolgast) and an eastern part (German: Wolgast jenseits der Swine, in literature also called Pomerania-Stolp after the residence in Stolp (Słupsk)). ==== Fourth partition 1376/1377–1478 and Pomeranian immediacy ==== In 1376, the western part of Pomerania-Wolgast (German: Wolgast diesseits der Swine) was subdivided in a smaller western part sometimes named Pomerania-Barth after the residence in Barth, and an eastern part which included the residence in Wolgast. In the following year, the eastern part of Pomerania-Wolgast (German: Wolgast diesseits der Swine or Pomerania-Stolp) was divided into a western part which included Stargard and an eastern part which included the residence in Stolp (Słupsk). In 1459, the eastern partitions of Pomerania-Wolgast around Stargard and Stolp ceased to exist. In 1478, after 200 years of partition, the duchy was reunited for a short period when all her parts were inherited by Bogislaw X. By the Treaty of Pyritz in 1493 Pomerania shook off the Marcher liege lordship and became again an immediate imperial estate, after new disputes finally confirmed by the Treaty of Grimnitz in 1529, both treaties provided Brandenburg succession in case the Pomeranian dukes would become extinct in the male line. ====Fifth and sixth partitions 1531–1625==== In 1531, Pomerania was partitioned into Pomerania-Stettin and Pomerania-Wolgast. This time however, in contrast to the earlier partitions with the same names, Pomerania- Wolgast included the western, and Pomerania-Stettin the eastern parts of the duchy. In 1569, were created the duchies of -Barth (split off from -Wolgast) and -Rügenwalde (Darłowo) (split off from -Stettin). ====Definitive reunification and annexation to Sweden==== In 1625, Bogislaw XIV reunited all Pomerania under his rule. However, in 1637, Sweden hold western parts of Pomerania (Hither Pomerania), originally including Stettin, legalised by the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 (Swedish Pomerania, several times reduced in favour of Brandenburgian Pomerania). Between 1637 and 1657 Lauenburg-Bütow Land came to Poland, thereafter to Brandenburg. In 1648, Brandenburg prevailed in the Peace of Westphalia with its claim only for eastern parts of Pomerania (Farther Pomerania), with the Brandenburg electors officially holding simultaneously the title of dukes of Pomerania until 1806 (end of the Empire and its enfeoffments), but de facto integrating their Pomerania into Brandenburg-Prussia, making it one of the provinces of Prussia in 1815, then including former Swedish Pomerania. ===Dukes of Pomerania: the House of Griffins=== ====Partitions of Pomerania under Griffins rule==== {|align=\"center\" style=\"border-spacing: 0px; border: 1px solid black; text- align: center;\" |+ |- | colspan=12 style=\"background: #fff;\" |Duchy of Pomerania (1121–1156) |- | colspan=4 style=\"background: #ffc;\" |Demmin (1st creation) (1156–1184) | colspan=4 style=\"background: #cef;\" |Stettin (1st creation) (1156–1264) | colspan=4 rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background: #9BBCC7;\" |Schlawe- Stolp (1156–1238) |- | colspan=8 style=\"background: #cef;\" | |- | colspan=4 rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #ffc;\" |Demmin (2nd creation) (1208–1264) | colspan=4 style=\"background: #cef;\" | |- | colspan=8 style=\"background: #cef;\" | |- | colspan=12 style=\"background: #fff;\" |Duchy of Pomerania (1264–1295) |- | colspan=10 style=\"background: #abc;\" |Wolgast (1st creation) (1295–1478) | colspan=2 rowspan=\"9\" style=\"background: #cef;\" |Stettin (2nd creation) (1295–1464) |- | colspan=5 style=\"background: #abc;\" | | colspan=5 style=\"background: #cab;\" |Stolp (1368–1459) |- | colspan=1 style=\"background: #ac9;\" |Barth (1st creation) (1377–1393) | colspan=4 style=\"background: #abc;\" | | colspan=4 style=\"background: #cab;\" | | colspan=1 rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #FFB6B6;\" |Stargard (1377-1395) |- | colspan=5 style=\"background: #abc;\" | | colspan=4 style=\"background: #cab;\" | |- | colspan=5 style=\"background: #abc;\" | | colspan=5 style=\"background: #cab;\" | |- | colspan=1 style=\"background: #ac9;\" |Barth (2nd creation) (1425–1451) | colspan=4 style=\"background: #abc;\" | | colspan=5 style=\"background: #cab;\" | |- | colspan=5 style=\"background: #abc;\" | | colspan=5 style=\"background: #cab;\" | |- | colspan=1 rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background: #ac9;\" |Barth (3rd creation) (1457–1478) | colspan=4 style=\"background: #abc;\" | | colspan=5 style=\"background: #cab;\" | |- | colspan=9 style=\"background: #abc;\" | |- | colspan=11 style=\"background: #abc;\" | |- | colspan=12 style=\"background: #fff;\" |Duchy of Pomerania (1478–1531) |- | colspan=10 style=\"background: #abc;\" |Wolgast (2nd creation) (1531–1625) | colspan=2 style=\"background: #cef;\" |Stettin (3rd creation) (1531–1569) |- | colspan=5 style=\"background: #abc;\" | | colspan=4 rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #ac9;\" |Barth (4th creation) (1569–1603) | colspan=1 style=\"background: #ba7;\" |Rügenwalde (1st creation) (1569–1600) | colspan=2 style=\"background: #cef;\" |(Wolgast line 1569–1600) |- | colspan=5 style=\"background: #abc;\" | | colspan=3 style=\"background: #cef;\" |(Rügenwalde line 1600–1603) |- | colspan=5 style=\"background: #abc;\" | | colspan=6 style=\"background: #cef;\" |(Barth line 1603–1625) | colspan=1 style=\"background: #ba7;\" |Rügenwalde (2nd creation) (1603–1620) |- | colspan=5 style=\"background: #abc;\" | | colspan=7 style=\"background: #cef;\" | |- | colspan=12 style=\"background: #fff;\" |Duchy of Pomerania (1625–1637) |} ====Table of rulers==== (Note: Here the numbering of the dukes is the same for all duchies, as all were titled Dukes of Pomerania, despite the different parts of land or particular numbering of the rulers.
