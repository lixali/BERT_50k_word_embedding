 "text": "The metre per second is an SI derived unit of both speed (scalar quantity) and velocity (vector quantity (which have direction and magnitude)), equal to the speed of a body covering a distance of one metre in a time of one second. The SI unit symbols are m/s, m·s−1, m s−1, or ,SI brochure, Section 5.1 sometimes (unofficially) abbreviated as . ==Conversions== is equivalent to: : = 3.6 km/h (exactly) : ≈ 3.2808 feet per second (approximately) : ≈ 2.2369 miles per hour (approximately) : ≈ 1.9438 knots (approximately) 1 foot per second = (exactly) 1 mile per hour = (exactly) 1 km/h = (exactly) ==Relation to other measures== The benz, named in honour of Karl Benz, has been proposed as a name for one metre per second. Although it has seen some support as a practical unit, primarily from German sources, it was rejected as the SI unit of velocity and has not seen widespread use or acceptance. == Unicode character == The \"metre per second\" symbol is encoded by Unicode at code point . ==See also== * Orders of magnitude (speed) * Metre per second squared * Metre ==References== ==External links== *Official BIPM definition of the metre *Official BIPM definition of the second Category:Units of velocity Category:SI derived units",
