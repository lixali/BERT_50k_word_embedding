 "text": "Pancreatic polypeptide cells (PP cells), or formerly as gamma cells (Î³-cells), or F cells, are cells in the pancreatic islets (Islets of Langerhans) of the pancreas. They produce pancreatic polypeptide, after which they are named. They are very few in number and are polygonal in shape. == Structure == PP cells tend to located in the pancreatic islets, and are one of the rarer pancreatic cell types. Some small clusters may also be found surrounded by exocrine pancreas. They tend to be located in the duodenal part of the pancreas more medially. They are polygonal in shape. PP cells have few granules. They also have very few organelles. == Other animals == In cats and dogs, PP cells have large granules. In rats, PP cells have few granules, similar to humans. In dogs, some PP cells are located in the walls of the antrum of the stomach. == See also == *List of human cell types derived from the germ layers ==References== ==External links== * Category:Sequestering cells Category:Endocrine cells",
