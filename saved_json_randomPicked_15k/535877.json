From 1640 to 1864 Altona was under the administration of the Danish monarchy. Altona was an independent borough until 1937. In 2016 the population was 270,263. == History == Altona was founded in 1535 as a village of fishermen in what was then Holstein-Pinneberg. In 1640, Altona came under Danish rule as part of Holstein-Glückstadt, and in 1664 was granted municipal rights by the Danish King Frederik III, who then ruled in personal union as Duke of Holstein. Altona was one of the Danish monarchy's most important harbor towns. The railroad from Altona to Kiel, the Hamburg-Altona–Kiel railway (), was opened in 1844. Because of severe restrictions on the number of Jews allowed to live in Hamburg until 1864 (with the exception of 1811–1815),Jewish Encyclopedia: Hamburg. \"In 1619 ... it was agreed that, in consideration of a payment made for their protection, the Jews should be tolerated in the town as strangers, though they were not to be allowed to practise their religion publicly\". \"In 1648 the council of aldermen issued an order expelling the German Jews [\"Hochdeutsche Juden\"] from the town. They moved to Altona, and were required to pay a monthly tax\". \"In 1697 the freedom of religious practice which the congregation had obtained was disturbed by hostile edicts of the aldermen, and the Jews were extortionately taxed. On this account many of the rich and important Portuguese Jews left Hamburg, some of them laying the foundation of the Portuguese congregation of Altona.\" (Jewish Encyclopedia) a major Jewish community developed in Altona starting in 1611, when Count Ernest of Schaumburg and Holstein-Pinneberg granted the first permanent residence permits to Ashkenazic Jews. Members did business both in Hamburg and in Altona itself. All that remains after the Nazi Holocaust during World War II are the Jewish cemeteries, but in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, the community was a major center of Jewish life and scholarship. Holstein-Pinneberg and later Danish Holstein had lower taxes and placed fewer civil impositions on their Jewish community than did the government of Hamburg. The wars between Denmark and the German Confederation — the First Schleswig War (1848–1851) and the Second Schleswig War (February – October 1864) — and the Gastein Convention of 1864, led to Denmark's cession of the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein to Prussian administration and Lauenburg to Austrian administration. Along with all of Schleswig-Holstein, Altona became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1867. In 1871 Altona became a part of the German Empire. In the same year the town was hit by cholera, with a minimum of 16 casualties in Altona. During the Weimar era following World War I, the town of Altona was disturbed by major labor strikes and street disorders. Inflation in Germany was a major problem. In 1923 Max Brauer, the mayor of Altona, directed that town personnel should be paid in part with gas meter tokens, as the tokens did not lose value from inflation. The most notable event at that time was the Altona Bloody Sunday (German: Altonaer Blutsonntag) on 17 July 1932, when several people were shot by the police force which was providing security for a demonstration by Nazi groups. After police raids and a special court, on 1 August 1933, Bruno Tesch and others were found guilty and put to death by beheading with a hand-held axe.Stolpersteine in Hamburg |url=http://87.106.6.17/stolpersteine- hamburg.de/en.php?&LANGUAGE;=EN&MAIN;_ID=7&BIO;_ID=234| In the 1990s, the Federal Republic of Germany reversed the convictions of Tesch and the other men who were put to death, clearing their names. In 1938 The Greater Hamburg Act removed Altona from the Free State of Prussia in 1937 and merged it (and several surrounding towns) with the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg. On 1 February 2007 the Ortsämter (district offices) in Hamburg were done away with. In Altona the districts of Blankenese, Lurup and Osdorf had existed and had local offices.
