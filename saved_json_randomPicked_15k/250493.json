 "text": "Paris Orly Airport (), commonly referred to as Orly , is an international airport located partially in Orly and partially in Villeneuve-le-Roi, south of Paris, France. It serves as a secondary hub for domestic and overseas territories flights of Air France and as the homebase for Transavia France. Flights operate to destinations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Caribbean and North America. Prior to the opening of Charles de Gaulle Airport in March 1974, Orly was the main airport of Paris. Even with the shift of most international traffic to Charles de Gaulle Airport, Orly remains the busiest French airport for domestic traffic and the second busiest French airport overall in passenger traffic, with 33,120,685 passengers in 2018. The airport is operated by Groupe ADP under the brand Paris Aéroport. Since February 2018, the CEO of the airport has been Régis Lacote. ==Location== Orly Airport covers of land. The airport area, including terminals and runways, spans over two départements and seven communes: * Essonne département: communes of Paray- Vieille-Poste (West Terminal and half of South Terminal), Wissous,\"Plan de Wissous .\" Wissous.

Management of the airport, however, is solely under the authority of Aéroports de Paris, which also manages Charles de Gaulle Airport, Le Bourget Airport, and several smaller airports in the suburbs of Paris. ==History== ===First years=== Originally known as Villeneuve-Orly Airport, the facility was opened in the southern suburbs of Paris in 1932 as a secondary airport to Le Bourget. Before this two huge airship hangars had been built there by the engineer Eugène Freyssinet from 1923 on. ===World War II=== As a result of the Battle of France in 1940, Orly Airport was used by the occupying German Luftwaffe as a combat airfield, stationing various fighter and bomber units at the airport throughout the occupation. Consequently, Orly was repeatedly attacked by the Royal Air Force and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), destroying much of its infrastructure, and leaving its runways with numerous bomb craters to limit its usefulness to the Germans. After the Battle of Normandy and the retreat of German forces from the Paris area in August 1944, Orly was partially repaired by USAAF combat engineers and was used by Ninth Air Force as tactical airfield A-47. The 50th Fighter Group flew P-47 Thunderbolt fighter-bomber aircraft from the airport until September, then liaison squadrons used the airfield until October 1945.Johnson, David C. (1988), U.S. Army Air Forces Continental Airfields (ETO), D-Day to V-E Day; Research Division, USAF Historical Research Center, Maxwell AFB, Alabama. ===Post-war=== The USAAF diagram from March 1947 shows the 27/207 (degrees magnetic) runway (later 03R) with 81/261 runway (later 08L) crossing it at its north end. The November 1953 Aeradio diagram shows four concrete runways, all wide: 03L , 03R , 08L and 08R . The American United States Army Air Forces 1408th Army Air Force Base Unit was the primary operator at Orly Field until March 1947 when control was returned to the French Government. (The United States Air Force leased a small portion of the Airport to support Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) at Rocquencourt). The Americans left in 1967 as a result of France's withdrawal from NATO's integrated military command, and all non-French NATO forces were asked to leave France.McAuliffe, Jerome J. (2005). US Air Force in France 1950–1967. San Diego, California: Milspec Press, Chapter 14, Paris-USAF Operations. . In May 1958, Pan Am Douglas DC-7Cs flew to Los Angeles in 21 hr 56 min; TWA, Air France and Pan Am flew nonstop to New York in 14 hrs 10–15 min. Air France flew to Tokyo in 31 hr 5 min via Anchorage or 44 hr 45 min on a seven-stop Lockheed Constellation (1049G model) via India. Air France's ten flights a day to London were almost all Vickers Viscounts; the only other London flight was Alitalia's daily Douglas DC-6B (BEA was at Le Bourget). A development project voted in 2012 planned to merge the airport's south and west terminals with the construction of an building to create one great terminal. On 14 April 2016, the Groupe ADP rolled out the Connect 2020 corporate strategy and the commercial brand Paris Aéroport was applied to all Parisian airports, including the Orly airport. On November 7th, 2015, the failure of a two-decade-old Windows 3.1 system which was responsible for communicating visual range information in foggy weather to pilots caused a temporary cease of operations. Whether the failure was hardware- or software- based is not specified, though the highlighting of the operating system suggests a software failure. As part of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on aviation, the airport was closed to all commercial traffic from 1 April 2020 to 25 June 2020. During this period, commercial traffic and flights were relocated to Charles de Gaulle Airport, while Orly was still used for State flights, emergency diversions, and medical evacuations. ==Terminals== thumb|Terminals 1, 2, 3, 4 ===Terminals 1 and 2=== Known as the West Terminal until March 2019, these two terminals consist of two floors and a gate area of four \"fingers\" rather than a brick-style layout. The ground level 0 features the arrivals facilities including eight baggage reclaim belts as well as several service facilities and shops. The departures area is located on level 1 with more stores and restaurants located here. This central departures area is connected to three gate areas split between Orly 1 (A and B gates) and Orly 2 (C gates). 23 stands at this terminal are equipped with jet-bridges, with several of them also able to handle wide-body aircraft.Google Maps ===Terminal 3=== Inaugurated in April 2019, Terminal 3 is a junction building between Terminals 1, 2 and 4. The terminal allows customers to travel between all areas of the airport under one roof. It includes around 5,000 sqm of Duty Free shopping along with several restaurants and lounges. It houses gates D and E, with direct access to Orly 4 departure gates. ===Terminal 4=== Formerly known as the South Terminal this innovative 1961 steel-and-glass terminal building consists of six floors. While the smaller basement level −1 as well as the upper levels 2, 3 and 4 contain only some service facilities, restaurants and office space, level 0 features the arrivals facilities as well as several shops and service counters. The airside area and departure gates are located on the upper level 1. The waiting area, which features several shops as well, houses gates E and F. 15 of the terminal's departure gates are equipped with jet-bridges, some of them are able to handle wide-body aircraft. ==Airlines and destinations== {{Airport-dest-list | Air Algérie | Algiers, Annaba, Batna, Béjaïa, Biskra, Constantine, Oran, Setif, Tlemcen | Air Caraïbes | Cancún (begins 22 October 2022), Cayenne, Fort-de-France, Havana, Pointe-à- Pitre, Port-au-Prince, Punta Cana, Santiago de Cuba, Santo Domingo–Las Americas, Sint Maarten Seasonal: San Salvador (Bahamas) | Air Corsica | Ajaccio, Bastia, Calvi, Figari | Air Europa | Madrid, Palma de Mallorca | Air France | Ajaccio, Algiers, Aurillac, Bastia, Berlin, Brive, Calvi, Castres, Cayenne, Figari, Fort-de-France, Lourdes (ends 31 May 2022), Madrid, Marseille, Munich, New York–JFK, Nice, Pointe-à-Pitre, Saint-Denis de la Réunion, Sint Maarten, Toulouse Seasonal: Bari, Geneva, Ibiza | Air Malta | Malta | Amelia International | Clermont-Ferrand, Rodez | Chalair Aviation | Limoges, Quimper | | Abidjan, Dzaoudzi, Fort-de-France, Mauritius, Montréal–Trudeau, Pointe-à-Pitre, Saint- Denis de la Réunion Seasonal: Punta Cana | easyJet | Berlin, Bristol, Faro, Geneva, Milan–Linate, Montpellier, Naples, Nice, Pisa, Rome–Fiumicino, Toulon, Toulouse, Venice Seasonal: Athens, Brindisi, Cagliari, Dubrovnik, Mykonos, Olbia, Palermo, Rhodes, Split | French Bee | Los Angeles (begins 9 April 2022), Newark, Papeete, Saint-Denis de la Réunion, San Francisco | Iberia | Madrid | ITA Airways | Milan–Linate | La Compagnie | Newark | Lufthansa | Munich | Pegasus Airlines | Istanbul–Sabiha Gökçen | Rossiya Airlines | Moscow–Sheremetyevo | Royal Air Maroc | Agadir, Casablanca, Dakhla, Fes, Marrakech, Oujda, Rabat, Tangier Seasonal: Essaouira, Nador, Ouarzazate | S7 Airlines | Moscow–Domodedovo | TAP Air Portugal | Lisbon, Porto | Transavia | Agadir, Algiers, Alicante, Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona, Bari, Beirut, Béjaïa, Biarritz, Brest, Budapest, Cairo,https://www.transavia.com/en-EU/destinations/ Casablanca, Constantine, Djerba, Dublin, Essaouira, Faro, Gran Canaria, Lisbon, Ljubljana (begins 24 April 2022), Madrid, Málaga, Malta, Marrakesh, Monastir, Montpellier, Naples, Oran, Oujda, Palma de Mallorca, Porto, Prague, Rabat, Reykjavík–Keflavík, Riga, Santiago de Compostela, Setif, Seville, Stockholm–Arlanda, Tel Aviv, Tirana, Tlemcen, Toulon, Tunis, Valencia, Verona, Vienna Seasonal: Amman–Queen Alia, Ancona, Ankara (begins 10 July 2022),https://www.transavia.com/en-EU/book-a-flight/flights/search/ Bilbao (begins 15 April 2022), Boa Vista, Bodrum (begins 5 June 2022),https://www.transavia.com/en-EU/book-a-flight/flights/search/ Cagliari, Chania, Corfu, Dakhla, Dubrovnik, Edinburgh, Eilat, Fes, Fuerteventura, Funchal, Glasgow (begins 1 April 2022), Heraklion, Hurghada, Kalamata, Kefalonia (begins 23 April 2022), Kittilä, Kos, Lamezia Terme (begins 8 July 2022),https://www.transavia.com/en-EU/book-a-flight/flights/search/ Larnaca (begins 9 July 2022),https://www.transavia.com/en-EU/book-a- flight/flights/search/ Mykonos, Olbia, Ouarzazate, Palermo, Pau, Perpignan, Podgorica (begins 23 April 2022), Ponta Delgada (begins 7 July 2022), Preveza, Pula, Sal, Santorini, Sfax, Skiathos (begins 23 April 2022), Split, Tangier, Thessaloniki, Tivat, Yerevan, Zadar | TUI fly Belgium | Seasonal: Agadir, Casablanca, Marrakesh, Oujda, Rabat | Tunisair | Djerba, Monastir, Sfax, Tunis | Twin Jet | Le Puy | Volotea | Lourdes (begins 1 June 2022) | Vueling | A Coruña, Agadir, Alexandria (begins 2 April 2022), Alicante, Asturias, Barcelona, Bari, Bergamo, Bergen, Billund, Birmingham, Bologna, Cardiff, Copenhagen, Cork, Dublin, Edinburgh, Florence, Fuerteventura, Genoa, Glasgow, Gothenburg, Granada, Gran Canaria, Hamburg, Ibiza, Jerez de la Frontera, La Palma, Lanzarote, Leipzig/Halle, Lisbon, London–Gatwick, Málaga, Malta, Milan–Malpensa, Newcastle upon Tyne, Nuremberg, Palma de Mallorca, Porto, Prague, Rome–Fiumicino, Santander, Santiago de Compostela, Seville, Stockholm–Arlanda, Tangier, Tenerife–South, Turin, Valencia, Zaragoza | Wizz Air | Budapest, Warsaw–Chopin }} ==Statistics== ==Other facilities== AOM French Airlines had its head office in Orly Airport Building 363 in Paray- Vieille-Poste.\"World Airline Directory 1999.\" Flight International. 2000. 363.\"Nos coordonnées agences en \"France Métropolitaine \".\" AOM French Airlines.

Three of the four occupants on board died. *On 27 November 1953, a USAF Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar crashed 4 km (2.5 mi) NE of ORY on approach, crashing in flames in the Cholsy-le-Roy neighborhood of Paris. The cause was the rear clam shell doors broke off striking striking the horizontal stabilizer, causing a catastrophic failure of the empennage. All six occupants were killed. *On 24 November 1956, Alitalia - Linee Aerre Italiane S.p.A. Flight 451, a Douglas DC-6 crashed 0.6 km (0.4 mi) W of ORY moments after takeoff, some 10–15 seconds later altitude was lost and the DC-6 struck a house 600 m past the runway end. All 10 crew and 34 of the 35 passengers were killed. Cause unknown. *On 21 January 1957, a SNCASE Armagnac crashed attempting to land at night with instrument landing system monitored by GCA.

The only survivors were two stewardesses seated in the rear of the plane. The charter flight was carrying home Atlanta's civic and cultural leaders of the day. At the time, this was the highest recorded death toll for an incident involving a single aircraft. * On 11 July 1973, Varig Flight 820, a Boeing 707, made a forced landing due to fire in a rear lavatory, incoming from Rio de Janeiro–Galeão. The aircraft landed 5 kilometers short of the runway, in a full-flap and gear down configuration. Due mainly to smoke inhalation, there were 123 deaths whilst 11 people survived (10 crew, one passenger). * On 3 March 1974, Turkish Airlines Flight 981, in an event known as the \"Ermenonville air disaster\", crashed in Ermenonville forest after take-off from Orly on a flight to London's Heathrow Airport when an improperly closed cargo door burst open. The explosive decompression that resulted brought down the McDonnell Douglas DC-10. All 346 people on board were killed, making the accident one of the deadliest in aviation history. ===Non-aircraft related=== * On 13 and 19 January 1975, a series of RPG attacks by Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine caused collateral damage and injured 23. * On 20 May 1978, three terrorists armed with submachine guns opened fire at the El Al boarding gate, killing 5 and injuring 5. * On 15 July 1983, a bombing of a Turkish Airlines check-in counter by ASALA killed 8 people and injured 55. * On 18 March 2017, a man attempted to grab the gun of a soldier who was patrolling the airport as part of Opération Sentinelle.
