It was founded by Peter Jackson, Richard Taylor, and Jamie Selkirk in 1993 to produce the digital special effects for Heavenly Creatures. The company went on to produce some of the highest- grossing films ever made, such as the Lord of the Rings trilogy and Avatar. Considered one of the most influential film companies of the 21st century, Weta Digital has won several Academy Awards and BAFTAs. Wētā FX is run by CEO Prem Akkaraju and is part of a number of Peter Jackson's co-owned companies in Wellington which includes Weta Productions and Park Road Post Production. The company is named after the New Zealand wētā, one of the world's largest insects, which is also featured in the logo. ==History== As of 2017, Wētā FX has won six Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002), The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), King Kong (2005), Avatar (2009), and The Jungle Book (2016). Wētā FX has developed several proprietary software packages to achieve groundbreaking visual effects. The scale of the battles required for The Lord of the Rings film trilogy led to the creation of MASSIVE, a program which can animate huge numbers of agents: independent characters acting according to pre-set rules. To recreate 1933 New York for King Kong, Wētā created CityBot, an application which could \"build\" the city on a shot by shot basis. Kong's fur also required the development of new simulation and modeling software. A set of tools that combined procedural and interactive techniques added wind to the 5 million individual strands of fur and modeled interaction with other surfaces. New shaders were written that accounted for the scattering of light from within each hair that added to the volumetric quality of the fur. Large chunks of fur were ripped out and filled in with scars, blood, and the mud of Skull Island. Each frame of fur took 2 gigabytes of data. For James Cameron's Avatar, Wētā modified MASSIVE to give life to the flora and fauna on Pandora, for which the company did most of the visual effects with the four-time Academy Award winner visual effects expert, Joe Letteri, under a team led by executive and producer Eileen Moran. In 2010, a texture painting application developed by Wētā for Avatar called Mari has been bought by The Foundry Visionmongers. For The Adventures of Tintin and Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Wētā developed a new grooming system called Barbershop where users can interactively manipulate digital hair. This tool received a Sci-tech award in 2015. Recently the company has developed their motion capture technique to be able to leave studio for shooting on location, as utilized on the film Rise of the Planet of the Apes and its sequel Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. On June 19, 2020, Weta Digital announced that it would be producing original animation content under the name Weta Animated, was getting a Multi-year Production Deal with Sony Pictures Animation. The company also announced a new chief executive Prem Akkaraju, who comes from Los Angeles. thumb|Previous logo with a New Zealand Wētā on top of the logo. In December 2020, Weta Digital CEO Prem Akkaraju announced additional board members including Tom Staggs, Jeff Huber and Ken Kamins. They join current board members Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, Sean Parker, Prem Akkaraju and Joe Letteri. On June 17, 2021, Weta Digital announced they have partnered with Autodesk to productize Weta's proprietary tools based in Autodesk Maya for a cloud service called WetaM. It will first be released in Q4 as a private beta. On August 23, 2021, Wētā announced a collaboration with SideFX for a cloud service combining Wētā's proprietary tools within SideFX's Houdini (software) called WetaH. On November 9, 2021, Jackson sold the company's VFX tools development division to video games software company Unity Technologies for US$1.62 billion. == Workplace culture == Beginning in June 2020, an investigative project by Kiwi public TV broadcaster 1 News into Wētā's workplace culture following a social media posting by former Wētā Workshop employee Layna Lazar later resulted in more than 40 current and former Weta Digital employees anonymously sharing accounts of \"sexism, bullying and harassment\" in September 2020. In their testimonies, workers identified the existence of a male-only pornographic mailing list called \"Caveman\", which originated in 2002 following a company-wide tradition known as Porn Friday, and continued to circulate until 2015. Several reports also alleged that the company's IT systems required upgrades in order to accommodate the volume of pornographic content hosted on the company intranet, in addition to numerous allegations of sexual harassment, bullying, intimidation, misogyny and homophobia. In response to these allegations, Wētā owners, including Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and chief executive officer Prem Akkaraju, commissioned an independent review from barrister Miriam Dean, who stated in her report that she received 80 complaints of bullying behavior, 120 complaints of inappropriate conduct and 19 complaints of sexual harassment from amongst the company's 1,500 employees. Dean put forward 17 recommendations for internal reform, including the establishment of a code of conduct, restricting the executive team, expanding the diversity and inclusion program, and reviewing the company's pay structure. Her review also stipulated that the existing management systems were not sufficient to protect workers \"from bullying, sexual harassment, sex discrimination and other inappropriate conduct\". == Film == === 1990s === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Films !Studio(s) and Distributor(s) |- |1994 |Heavenly Creatures\"The Birth of Weta\", 1994, \"The Edge\" TV series, S2E7 |Miramax Films |- |1995 |Forgotten Silver |TBC |- | rowspan=\"2\" |1996 |Tales from the Crypt (You, Murderer) |Warner Bros. |- |The Frighteners |Universal Pictures |- |1997 |Contact |Warner Bros. |} === 2000s === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Films !Studio(s) and Distributor(s) |- |2001 |The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring | rowspan=\"3\" |New Line Cinema |- |2002 |The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers |- |2003 |The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King |- | rowspan=\"2\" |2004 |Van Helsing |Universal Studios |- |I, Robot |20th Century Fox |- |2005 |King Kong |Universal Studios |- | rowspan=\"2\" |2006 |X-Men: The Last Stand | rowspan=\"2\" |20th Century Fox |- |Eragon |- | rowspan=\"5\" |2007 |Bridge to Terabithia |Walt Disney Pictures |- |Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer |20th Century Fox |- |Enchanted |Walt Disney Pictures |- |The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep | rowspan=\"2\" |Columbia Pictures |- |30 Days of Night |- | rowspan=\"3\" |2008 |Jumper |20th Century Fox |- |The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian |Walt Disney Studios |- |The Day the Earth Stood Still |20th Century Fox |- | rowspan=\"3\" |2009 |District 9 |TriStar Pictures |- |The Lovely Bones |Paramount Pictures DreamWorks Pictures |- |Avatar |20th Century Fox |} === 2010s === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Films !Studio(s) and Distributor(s) |- | rowspan=\"4\" |2010 |The A-Team | rowspan=\"6\" |20th Century Fox |- |Knight and Day |- |Predators |- |Gulliver's Travels |- | rowspan=\"3\" |2011 |X-Men: First Class |- |Rise of the Planet of the Apes |- |The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn |Paramount Pictures |- | rowspan=\"4\" |2012 |The Avengers |Walt Disney Studios Paramount Pictures |- |Prometheus | rowspan=\"2\" |20th Century Fox |- |Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter |- |The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey |Warner Bros. |- | rowspan=\"5\" |2013 |Iron Man 3 |Walt Disney Studios Paramount Pictures |- |Man of Steel |Warner Bros. |- |The Wolverine |20th Century Fox |- |The Hunger Games: Catching Fire |Lionsgate |- |The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug | rowspan=\"2\" |Warner Bros. |- | rowspan=\"4\" |2014 |Godzilla |- |Dawn of the Planet of the Apes |20th Century Fox |- |The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies |Warner Bros. |- |What We Do in the Shadows |Paramount Pictures |- | rowspan=\"6\" |2015 |Furious 7 |Universal Studios |- |Fantastic Four | rowspan=\"2\" |20th Century Fox |- |Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials |- |The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 |Lionsgate |- |Krampus |Universal Studios |- |Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip | rowspan=\"2\" |20th Century Fox |- | rowspan=\"8\" |2016 |Deadpool |- |Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice |Warner Bros. |- |The Jungle Book |Walt Disney Studios |- |Central Intelligence |Warner Bros.
