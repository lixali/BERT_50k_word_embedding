 "text": "Many Arabs in Iraq identify strongly with a tribe (العشيرة 'ashira). 30 of the 150 or so identifiable tribes of Iraq are the most influential. Tribes are grouped into federations (qabila). Below the tribe, there are the clan (الفخذ fukhdh), the house (البيت beit) and the extended family (الخمس khams). On its accession to power in the 17 July Revolution of 1968, the Ba'ath Party announced its opposition to tribalism ( القبلية al-qabaliyya), although for pragmatic reasons, especially during the war with Iran, tribalism was sometimes tolerated and even encouraged. == List of major tribes ('ashira) == * Al-Sadr * Shammar * Al-Dulaimi * Al-Jubouri * Al-Aniza * Al-Asadi * Al-Ali * Al-Duraji * Bani Hasan * Al-Khazraj * Banu Lam * Bani Malik * Al-Muntafiq * Al-Bu Nasir * Al-Dhafeer * Al-Musawi * Al-Ubaid * Otaibah * Al-Zubaidi * Mutair * Banu Tamim * Banu Kilab Partial source: Tribes in Iraq, Humanitarian Information Centre for Iraq. 2003. ==See also== *Iraqis *Arabs == References == *Tripp, Charles (2000) A History of Iraq.
