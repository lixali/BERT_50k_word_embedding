 "text": "Abundantia (minor planet designation: 151 Abundantia) is a stony main belt asteroid. It was discovered by Johann Palisa on 1 November 1875, from the Austrian Naval Observatory in Pula. The name was chosen by Edmund Weiss of the Vienna Observatory; although the name refers to Abundantia, a Roman goddess of luck, it was also chosen to celebrate the increasing numbers of asteroids that were being discovered in the 1870s. Information from A. Harris as of March 1, 2001 indicates that 151 Abundantia is an S class (stony) asteroid with a diameter of 45.37 km and H = 9.24 .1728 and albedo of 0.03. The light curve collected over 6 nights from 2/16/2002 to 3/10/2002 confirmed the rotational period to be 19.718h. Data from 2001 shows a diameter of 45.37 km. An occultation by the asteroid was observed on December 10, 2017, showing the asteroid to be highly elongated, with dimensions of roughly 24 x 52 km. ==References== == External links == * Lightcurve Data for 51 Abundantia, Sunflower Observatory () * Lightcurve plot of 151 Abundantia, Palmer Divide Observatory, B.
