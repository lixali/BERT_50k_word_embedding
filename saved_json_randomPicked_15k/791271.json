As of 2022, U.S. News & World Report listed NYIT as a \"selective\" university with an acceptance rate of 75%. ==History== ===Foundation and vision=== In 1955, New York Institute of Technology opened under a provisional charter granted by the New York State Board of Regents to NYIT. Its first campus opened at 500 Pacific Street in the Borough of Brooklyn, New York. The founders of NYIT, and in particular, Alexander Schure, started NYIT with the mission of offering career-oriented professional education, providing all qualified students access to opportunity, and supporting applications-oriented research. Schure later served as NYIT's first president. In the higher education community at the time, a debate arose around the concern that humanities studies would be overshadowed by too much emphasis on science and engineering. NYIT's goal was to create a balance between science/engineering and a liberal arts education, and ever since, it has been focusing on this model to prepare students for current and future careers. By the 1958–1959 academic year, the university had 300 students, and the time had come to expand its physical operations. In April 1958, the college purchased the Pythian Temple at 135–145 W. 70th St. in Manhattan for its main center. The building, adjacent to the planned Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, was an ornate 12-story structure with a columned entranceway. Built in 1929 at a cost of $2 million, it included among its features a 1,200-seat auditorium. In 1958, NYIT sponsored the first National Technology Awards, created by Frederick Pittera, an organizer of international fairs and a member of the NYIT Board of Trustees, to help raise funds for the NYIT science and technology laboratories. The awards, held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, were attended by several hundred guests, with entertainment provided by the U.S. Air Force Band. 36th President of the United States Lyndon Johnson was the keynote speaker. His speech was broadcast nationally by the ABC Radio Network. Among the honorees were Dr. Wernher von Braun and Major General Bernard Schriever, Commanding General of the Ballistic Air Command. Photos, press clippings, and audio tapes of the event are on view at the Lyndon Johnson Library at Austin, Texas. ===Distinction through technology=== thumb|left|NYIT pioneered computers in the classrooms, it was the first to introduce “teaching machines” in the 1950s ====Teaching Machines==== In 1959, NYIT introduced “teaching machines” for student instruction in physics, electronics, and mathematics. NYIT also pioneered the use of mainframes as a teaching tool, having received its first, donated by the CIT Financial Corporation, in 1965. The curriculum was successful enough that NYIT received two grants totaling approximately $3 million from the federal government – one to develop a system of individualized learning through the use of computers; the other to develop a computer-based course in general physics for midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. ====NYIT Computer Graphics Lab==== In 1974, New York Institute of Technology Computer Graphics Lab was established and attracted the likes of: Pixar Animation Studios President Edwin Catmull and co-founder Alvy Ray Smith; Walt Disney Feature Animation Chief Scientist Lance Williams; DreamWorks animator Hank Grebe; and Netscape and Silicon Graphics founder James H. Clark. Researchers at the New York Institute of Technology Computer Graphics Lab created the tools that made entirely 3D CGI films possible. NYIT CG Lab was regarded as the top computer animation research and development group in the world during the late 70s and early 80s.Brief History of the New York Institute of Technology Computer Graphics Lab (retrieved 30 June 2012)A compilation of NYIT images and information can be found on Paul Heckbert's site(retrieved 30 June 2012) ====Clean Air Road Rally==== In 1995, the NYIT School of Engineering took first place in the U.S. Department of Energy's Clean Air Road Rally. The student engineering team spent three years designing and building the high-performance hybrid electric car that beat 43 other vehicles.

NYIT's College of Osteopathic Medicine also uses 3-D motion capture technology to help doctors better identify mobility and stability problems in patients with Parkinson's disease. * In July 2008 NYIT sponsored the first annual International Water Conference at the United Nations in New York City. The event brought together representatives from non- governmental organizations, international corporations, and universities to discuss the need to safeguard the planet's water resources. * In 2009 NYIT sponsored its second U.N. event, the International Energy Conference (Aug. 31-Sept. 1, 2009) to welcome energy secretaries, policy makers, and executives from multinational companies to examine opportunities and innovations in the field of sustainable technology. * NYIT closed its campuses in Jordan and Bahrain in 2013 and 2014 respectively.Bahrain/Jordan Phase out nyit.edu retrieved on 2014-03-10 NYIT had to close its campus in Bahrain because the Higher Education Council of Bahrain decided to come up with a new set of regulations, aiming to standardize all private universities in Bahrain. NYIT could not adapt to the changes like the other local universities in Bahrain, as all NYIT campuses around the world must follow the same American standard programs, otherwise they would be threatened to lose their international license and accreditation. ====Strategic plan==== From 2000 to 2015, NYIT invested in initiatives to enhance the quality of the university, including campus infrastructure, a larger faculty, new endowed chairs and professorships. The money came from federal grants, New York state grants, and National Science Foundation grants, as well as university funding and contributions from alumni, corporations and foundations.NYIT-Worldwide | NYIT .
