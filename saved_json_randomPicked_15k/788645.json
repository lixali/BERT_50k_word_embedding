 "text": "The Houston Press is an online newspaper published in Houston, Texas, United States. It is headquartered in the Midtown area. It was also a weekly print newspaper until November 2017. The publication is supported entirely by advertising revenue and is free to readers. It reports a monthly readership of 1.6 million online users. Prior to the 2017 cessation of the print edition, the Press was found in restaurants, coffee houses, and local retail stores. New weekly editions were distributed on Thursdays. ==History== The alt-weekly Houston Press was founded in 1989 by John Wilburn, Chris Hearne (founder of Austin's Third Coast Magazine) and Kirk Cypel (a Vice President of a Houston- based investment group) conceived of this news and entertainment weekly after rejecting a business plan to relaunch Texas Business Magazine. Hearne and John Wilburn, who previously managed the Sunday magazine of the Dallas Morning News, jointly established the magazine. Hearne was the paper's first publisher and Cypel served as the organization's business advisor. Although the paper faced early challenges, the landscape changed when Hearne and Cypel engineered a buyout of 713 Magazine, a key competitor. Once in control of 713, they stopped its publication and converted advertisers to the Houston Press. Thereafter, the Houston Presss advertising and circulation grew dramatically. Prior to the establishment of the Houston Press, the city did not have a major alternative weekly publication. Its original cover story was about the election of the Mayor of Houston. For the newspaper's first five years, Niel Morgan served as the investor,Tyer, Brad. \"Mama Ninfa and her Comeback Kids.\" Houston Press. Thursday August 6, 1998. 1.

After Wilburn and Morgan found themselves disagreeing over aspects of the paper, Wilburn quit. In the period before 1993 the Houston Press experienced financial difficulties. That year Morgan sold the paper, to New Times Media. Sexually-oriented advertising appeared after the sale. The paper's fortunes improved due to the dot-com bubble of 1997-2001 and the increase in advertising; it was one of the first alternative weeklies in the United States to establish a website. In 1998 Houston Press acquired the assets of an alternative paper, Public News, that was ceasing operations. Employees of Public News' sales department began working for the Houston Press. That year Margaret Downing became the primary editor. There were 23 reporters and editors in 1998. Michael Hardy stated in the Texas Observer that the \"heyday\" of the paper was around 2004. Advertising-related income declined due to the rise of persons reading articles online, as well as the establishment of Craigslist. In 2005, New Times acquired Village Voice Media, and changed its name to Village Voice Media. In September 2012, Village Voice Media executives Scott Tobias, Christine Brennan and Jeff Mars bought Village Voice Media's papers and associated web properties from its founders and formed Voice Media Group. The paper's fortunes declined, as Backpage, which separated from Village Voice Media, had contributed significant funding. On November 3, 2017, Voice Media Group announced that it would cease printing of the Press, moving to online-only publication, and that the paper would only use freelance journalists. Voice Media Group cited Hurricane Harvey as the final factor behind the cessation, and Downing stated that a recession in the oil industry and the decline of revenue from advertising contributed to the decision. The majority of the Press employees, including nine full-time editorial staff members and at least 6 employees on the advertising staff, lost their jobs. Downing and publisher Stuart Folb continued, along with a small advertising staff and marketing manager. The online-only scenario was a compromise reached by Downing and Folb with the owners, who initially wished to completely shut the paper down. ==Content== Hardy stated that the Houston Press, known for its coverage of the culture of Houston, was like a \"court jester\" compared to the Houston Chronicle being the \"king\" of Houston's journalism industry; he added \"Its music and arts listings were more comprehensive and reliable than those of the Chronicle, which often seemed painfully out of touch, and it had the best critics in the city.\" He added that \"The Press established a reputation for punching above its weight\" in regards to investigative journalism, citing how an article lead to the exoneration of Roy Criner. The publication included John Nova Lomax's articles on the cityscape and music as well as Robb Walsh's articles on the cuisine of Houston. ==Headquarters== The headquarters of the Houston Press are located in Midtown Houston on McGowen Street.
