 "text": "Clay County (county code CY) is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 8,117. Its county seat and most populous city is Clay Center. ==History== ===Early history=== For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau. ===19th century=== In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1857, Clay County was established. When the first counties were created by the Kansas legislature in 1855, the territory within the present limits of the county was attached to Riley County for all revenue and judicial purposes. Subsequently, Clay was attached to Geary County. In 1857, Clay was created and named in honor of the famous American statesman Henry Clay, a member of the United States Senate from Kentucky and United States Secretary of State in the 19th century. In 1887, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway built a branch line from Neva (3 miles west of Strong City) to Superior, Nebraska. This branch line connected Strong City, Neva, Rockland, Diamond Springs, Burdick, Lost Springs, Jacobs, Hope, Navarre, Enterprise, Abilene, Talmage, Manchester, Longford, Oak Hill, Miltonvale, Aurora, Huscher, Concordia, Kackley, Courtland, Webber, Superior. At some point, the line from Neva to Lost Springs was pulled but the right of way has not been abandoned. This branch line was originally called \"Strong City and Superior line\" but later the name was shortened to the \"Strong City line\". In 1996, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway merged with Burlington Northern Railroad and renamed to the current BNSF Railway. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the \"Santa Fe\". ===21st century=== In 2010, the Keystone-Cushing Pipeline (Phase II) was constructed north to south through Clay County, with much controversy over tax exemption and environmental concerns (if a leak ever occurs).Keystone Pipeline - Marion County Commission calls out Legislative Leadership on Pipeline Deal; April 18, 2010. Keystone Pipeline - TransCanada inspecting pipeline; December 10, 2010. A pumping station named Riley was built along the pipeline. ==Geography== According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.6%) is water. ===Adjacent counties=== * Washington County (north) * Riley County (east) * Geary County (southeast) * Dickinson County (south) * Ottawa County (southwest) * Cloud County (west) ===Major highways=== Sources: National Atlas,National Atlas U.S. Census Bureau * U.S. Route 24 * Kansas Highway 15 * Kansas Highway 82 ==Demographics== As of the 2000 census, there were 8,822 people, 3,617 households, and 2,517 families residing in the county.

The solitary Democrat to win a majority of Clay County's votes has been William Jennings Bryan in 1896, although Woodrow Wilson in a four-way race in 1912, and Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932 both obtained slim pluralities. Roosevelt in 1936, when he lost to Kansan Alf Landon by eighty- four votes, remains the last Democrat to win forty percent of the county's vote, and Jimmy Carter in 1976 is the last to pass thirty percent. ==Education== ===Unified school districts=== * Clay County USD 379 ==Communities== ===Cities=== * Clay Center * Wakefield * Clifton (partly in Washington County) * Morganville * Green * Longford * Vining (partly in Washington County) * Oak Hill ===Unincorporated communities=== †This populated place is designated a Census-Designated Place (CDP) by the United States Census Bureau. * Idana† * Industry * Ladysmith ===Ghost towns=== * Athelstane * Bateham * Broughton, razed when Milford Lake was built * Browndale * Exeter * Fact * Fancy Creek * Garfield Center * Gatesville * Northern * Republican City ===Townships=== Clay County is divided into eighteen townships.
