As of 2011, she had sold 10 million albums worldwide and has won numerous national and international awards, including four Latin Grammys, seven Brazilian MTV Video Music Awards, nine Multishow de Música Brasileira awards, 5 APCAs, and six Prêmio TIM de Música.

On her father's side, she is descended from the Saboias, one of the oldest Italian families in Brazil. She studied singing, piano, and drums as a child, and began studying opera singing at 14. After failing to break through into 1980s Brazilian pop rock she went into semi-exile in Italy, where she met the famous producer Nelson Motta. Thereafter she became a hybrid of MPB diva and pop rock performer. While most of her music is in the style of modern MPB, she has also recorded traditional samba and folk tunes, largely in collaboration with such musicians and songwriters as Carlinhos Brown, Arnaldo Antunes, and Nando Reis and producer Arto Lindsay. She has also collaborated with the New York pop music vanguard, including Laurie Anderson, David Byrne, Marc Ribot, Bernie Worrell and Philip Glass. ===Career=== Monte owns the rights to all of her songs; it was her chief demand for renewing her contract with EMI Music.Musitec She also released her single \"Não é Proibido\", which was also used in the soundtrack of a video game by EA Sports, 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa. ==Discography== thumb|Marisa Monte|right {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" |- !
