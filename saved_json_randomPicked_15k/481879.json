Barsamian started working in radio in 1978 at KGNU in Boulder, Colorado and then KRZA in Alamosa, Colorado. Articles by (and interviews with) Barsamian have appeared regularly in The Progressive, The Sunand Z Magazine. Barsamian also lectures on U.S. foreign policy, corporate control, the media, and propaganda. As a writer, Barsamian is best known for his series of interviews with Noam Chomsky, which have been published in book form and translated into many languages. ==Deportation from India== On 23 September 2011, Barsamian was deported from India. After arriving on a flight at the Indira Gandhi International Airport he was refused entry and placed on a return flight. Barsamian attributes this to his reportage on human rights abuses in Jammu and Kashmir. ==Bibliography== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year !! Title !! Publisher !! ISBN !!
