 "text": "The title Earl of Newburgh (pronounced \"New-bruh\") was created in the Peerage of Scotland in 1660 for James Livingston, 1st Viscount of Newburgh, along with the subsidiary titles Viscount of Kynnaird and Lord Levingston. The viscountcy of Newburgh and Livingston baronetcy, which devolved upon the 1st Earl, were created with remainder to heirs male and became extinct on the death of the 2nd Earl (2nd Viscount and 3rd Baronet). However, the Earldom and its subsidiary titles, which were created with remainder to heirs whomsoever,Sir James Balfour Paul, The Scots Peerage, vol. vi, p. 453 can be inherited through male and female lines, thus passing by marriage through various different families. The 3rd Countess's second husband was the titular 5th Earl of Derwentwater (a younger brother of the attainted 3rd Earl), and so the 4th and 5th Earls of Newburgh were also titular Earls of Derwentwater, Viscounts Radclyffe and Langley and Barons Tyndale, of Tyndale, Northumberland, in the Jacobite Peerage. On the death of the 5th Earl (also titular 7th Earl of Derwentwater), the title passed to a descendant of the daughter (and only child) of the 3rd Countess by her first husband, namely the 6th Prince Giustiniani. His daughter, the 7th Countess of Newburgh married the 4th Marquis Bandini and was succeeded, upon her death in 1877, by her son (created Prince Bandini-Giustiniani in 1863) as 8th Duke of Mondragone and 8th Earl of Newburgh. In 1941, upon the death of his son the 9th Earl, the title devolved upon the princely Rospigliosi family. The 12th and present Earl of Newburgh is usually known in Italy - he lives in Milan - as Prince Rospigliosi, and holds several other titles of nobility: Duke of Zagarolo, Prince Castiglione, Marquis of Giuliana, Count of Chiusa and Baron of La Miraglia and Valcorrente (Two Sicilies and Italy), Lord of Aldone, Burgio, Contessa and Trappeto (Rome), and Patrician of Venice, Genoa, Pistoia, Ferrara and Ravenna (Venice and Genoa). ==Livingston Baronets, of Kinnaird (1627)== *Sir John Livingston, 1st Baronet (d. 1628) *Sir James Livingston, 2nd Baronet (c. 1622–1670) (created Viscount Newburgh in 1647 and Earl of Newburgh in 1660) ==Earls of Newburgh (1660)== *James Livingston, 1st Earl of Newburgh (c. 1622–1670) *Charles Livingston, 2nd Earl of Newburgh (c. 1664–1694) *Charlotte Maria Radclyffe, 3rd Countess of Newburgh (c. 1694–1755) *James Bartholomew Radclyffe, 4th Earl of Newburgh and titular 6th Earl of Derwentwater (1725–1787) *Anthony James Radclyffe, 5th Earl of Newburgh and titular 7th Earl of Derwentwater (1757–1814) *Vincenzo Giuseppe Filippo Graziliano Giacopo Gasparo Baldassaro Melchior Domenico Giustiniani, 6th Prince Giustiniani and ''de jure'' 6th Earl of Newburgh (1762–1826) *Maria Cecilia Agata Anna Josefa Laurenzia Donata Melchiorra Baldassara Gaspara Bandini, Duchess of Mondragone and 7th Countess of Newburgh (1796–1877) *Sigismondo Niccolo Venanzio Gaetano Francisco Giustiniani-Bandini, 1st Prince Bandini-Giustiniani and 8th Earl of Newburgh (1818–1908) *Carlo Giustiniani-Bandini, 2nd Prince Bandini- Giustiniani and 9th Earl of Newburgh (1862–1941) *Maria Sofia Guiseppina Giustiniani-Bandini, 10th Countess of Newburgh (1889–1977) *Giulio Cesare Taddeo Cosimo Rospigliosi, 10th Prince Rospigliosi and 11th Earl of Newburgh (1907–1986) *Filippo Giambattista Camillo Francesco Aldo Maria Rospigliosi, 11th Prince Rospigliosi and 12th Earl of Newburgh (b. 1942)www.burkespeerage.com The heiress presumptive is the present holder's only daughter Princess Benedetta Francesca Maria Rospigliosi, Mistress of Newburgh (b. 1974) The heir presumptive's heir apparent is her son Carlo Filippo Maria Albertario (b. 2001) ==See also== * Count * House of Lords * Palazzo Rospigliosi * Rospigliosi family ==References== ==External links== * www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk * www.electricscotland.com * www.hereditarypeers.com Category:Earldoms in the Peerage of Scotland Category:Italian nobility Category:Noble titles created in 1660 Category:1660 establishments in Scotland",
