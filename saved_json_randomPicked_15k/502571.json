 "text": "Bercy () is a station of the Paris Métro, serving lines 6 and 14 at the intersection of the Boulevard de Bercy and the Rue de Bercy in the neighbourhood of Bercy and the 12th arrondissement. ==History== The station opened on 1 March 1909 with the opening of the original section of line 6 from Place d'Italie to Nation (although part of line 5—some dating back to 2 October 1900—was incorporated into line 6 on 12 October 1942). The line 14 platforms were opened on 15 October 1998 as part of the original section of the line from Madeleine to Bibliothèque François Mitterrand. It is named after the streets it is situated in and the neighbourhood of Bercy, which is mentioned in a document written in 1134. Over the centuries the Lords of Bercy built a castle there which eventually covered a third of the commune of Bercy, which was absorbed into Paris in 1860. It was the location of the Barrière de Bercy, a gate built for the collection of taxation as part of the Wall of the Farmers-General; the gate was built between 1784 and 1788 and demolished in the nineteenth century. ==Nearby Attractions== * The Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy (or POPB) is a major sports arena, located to the south of Bercy station. * The Ministry of the Eeconomy and Finance (Ministère de l'Économie et des Finances) also known simply as \"Bercy\", is located to the west of Bercy station. * The Gare de Bercy, serving medium-distance domestic services to Avallon via Laroche-Migennes, Sens, and Auxerre. == Station layout == {| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 valign=top|G |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=100 valign=top|Street Level |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=400 valign=top|Exit/Entrance |- |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 valign=top|B1 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=100 valign=top|Mezzanine |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=400 valign=top|to Exits/Entrances |- |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 rowspan=4 valign=top|B2 |style=\"border- top:solid 1px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2| |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=100|Westbound |style=\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=390|← toward Charles de Gaulle – Étoile |- |Eastbound | toward Nation → |- |style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border- right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;text-align:center;\" colspan=2| |- |style=\"border-top:solid 0px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 rowspan=4 valign=top|B3 |style=\"border-top:solid 0px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border- left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2| |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=100|Northbound |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=390|← toward Mairie de Saint-Ouen |- |Southbound | toward Olympiades (Cour Saint-Émilion) |- |style=\"border- top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;text-align:center;\" colspan=2| |} ==Gallery== File:Metro de Paris - Bercy 01.jpg|Street-level entrance at Bercy File:Metro de Paris - Ligne 6 - Bercy 03.jpg|MP 73 rolling stock on Line 6 at Bercy File:Metro de Paris - Ligne 14 - Bercy 01.jpg|Line 14 platforms at Bercy File:Metro de Paris - Ligne 14 - Bercy 02.jpg|Access to Line 14 platforms File:Metro de Paris - Ligne 14 - Bercy 03.jpg|Line 14 platform (view towards Saint-Lazare) File:Metro de Paris - Ligne 14 - Bercy 04.jpg|Line 14 platform (view towards Olympiades) ==Notes== ==References== *Roland, Gérard (2003).
