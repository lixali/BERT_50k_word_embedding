 "text": "The voiced palatal lateral approximant is a type of consonantal sound used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , a rotated lowercase letter (not to be confused with lowercase lambda, ), and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is `L`. Many languages that were previously thought to have a palatal lateral approximant actually have a lateral approximant that is, broadly, alveolo-palatal; that is to say, it is articulated at a place in-between the alveolar ridge and the hard palate (excluded), and it may be variously described as alveolo-palatal, lamino- postalveolar,, citing or postalveolo-prepalatal. None of the 13 languages investigated by , many of them Romance, has a 'true' palatal. That is likely the case for several other languages listed here. Some languages, like Portuguese and Catalan, have a lateral approximant that varies between alveolar and alveolo-palatal. There is no dedicated symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents the alveolo-palatal lateral approximant. If precision is desired, it may be transcribed or ; they are essentially equivalent because the contact includes both the blade and body (but not the tip) of the tongue. There is also a non-IPA letter (\"l\", plus the curl found in the symbols for alveolo-palatal sibilant fricatives ), used especially in Sinological circles. The voiced palatal lateral approximant contrasts phonemically with its voiceless counterpart in the Xumi language spoken in China. == Features == Features of the voiced palatal lateral approximant: == Occurrence == {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"2\" | Language !!
