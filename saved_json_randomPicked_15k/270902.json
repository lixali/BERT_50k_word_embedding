Helmed by a Captain Aitken, it left Geelong bound for Sydney on 23 December 1937, but ran aground in heavy fog. All crew on board were rescued after a distress signal brought assistance from other ships. Remnants from the wreckage are still visible to walkers in the area. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1910 ships Category:Shipwrecks of Victoria (Australia) Category:Iron and steel steamships of Australia Category:Maritime incidents in 1937",
