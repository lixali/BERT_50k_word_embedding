According to the Rabatak inscription, he was the great grandfather of the great Kushan king Kanishka I. He is considered the founder of the Kushan Empire. ==History== The origins of Kujula Kadphises are quite obscure, and he is usually believed to be a descendant of the Kushan ruler Heraios, or possibly identical with him.Cribb, J. (1993), The Heraus coins: their attribution to the Kushan king Kujula Kadphises, c. AD 30-80. Essays in Honour of Robert Carson and Kenneth Jenkins, (edited by M. Price, A. Burnett, and R. Bland), London, 107-134. However, Kujula shares his name (Kushan: Κοζουλου on some of his \"Hermaeus\" coins, or Κοζολα on his \"Augustus\" coins) with some of the last Indo-Scythian rulers, such as Liaka Kusulaka (Greek: Λιακα Κοζουλο), or his son Patika Kusulaka, which might suggest some family connection.Rapson, \"Indian coins of the British Museum\", p.cvi ===Chinese accounts=== In the process of their expansion eastward, Kujula Kadphises and his son Vima Takto (or Vema Tahktu) seem to have displaced the Indo-Parthian kingdom, established in northwestern India by the Parthian Gondophares since around 20 CE: > His son, Yangaozhen [probably Vema Tahktu or, possibly, his brother > Sadaṣkaṇa], became king in his place. He defeated Tianzhu [North-western > India] and installed Generals to supervise and lead it. The Yuezhi then > became extremely rich. All the kingdoms call [their king] the Guishuang > [Kushan] king, but the Han call them by their original name, Da Yuezhi > [Great Yuezhi].Hill (2009), p. 29. The invasion of the Indo-Parthian kingdom led by Kujula Kadphises is thought to have occurred some time after 45 CE, during the reign of Gondophares's successors: Abdagases and Sases. ===Genealogy according to the Rabatak inscription=== thumb|Kujula Kadphises coin.

The connection of Kujula with other Kushan rulers is described in the Rabatak inscription, discovered in Rabatak in what was once Bactria in 1993, which was inscribed by Kanishka. Kanishka states Kujula Kadphises to be his great-grandfather, Vima Taktu to be his grandfather, Vima Kadphises to be his father, and himself Kanishka: > And he [Kanishka] gave orders to make images of the same, (namely) of these > gods who are written herein, and he gave orders to make (them) for these > kings: for King Kujula Kadphises (his) great grandfather, and for King Vima > Taktu (his) grandfather, and for King Vima Kadphises (his) father, and for > himself, King Kanishka.Sims-Williams' \"provisional translation\" quoted in > Hill (2009), p. 592. ==Coinage== The coinage of the Kushan ruler, Kujula Kadphises, shows us the enlargement of the religious horizon of the Kushans. His first issue, which has the debased portrait and name of Hermaeus on the obverse, shows Heracles on the reverse, still following the Greek tradition, even though Heracles may be the Interpretatio graeca of the Iranian god Verethragna, contrary to earlier assumptions, which regarded Kujula Kadphises as Buddhist on the basis of the epithet. thumb|Coin of Kujula Kadphises.
