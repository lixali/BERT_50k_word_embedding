 "text": "The vast majority of Jews in Oceania (estimation 120,000) live in Australia, with a population of about 7,000 in New Zealand (6867, according to the 2013 NZ Census). Most are Ashkenazi Jews, with many being survivors of the Holocaust arriving during and after World War II. More recently, a significant number of Jews have arrived from South Africa, Israel, the United Kingdom and Russia. The official number of people who practised Judaism in the 2001 census was only 121,459 but this number is expected to be much higher, as it did not count those overseas (i.e. dual Australian-Israeli nationals) or many non- practicing Jews who prefer not to disclose religion in the census are more common. Ironically, ever since the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788, Australia's Jewish population has hovered around 0.5% of the total counted. The vast majority of Australia's Jews live in inner suburbs of Melbourne and Sydney with smaller populations, in numerical order, in Perth, Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Adelaide. Currently, there are also recognised communities in Ballarat, Bendigo/Castlemaine, Canberra, Geelong, Gosford, Hobart, Launceston and Newcastle. In Melbourne, the Jewish population centre is Caulfield where there are streets with nearly a 100% Jewish population; the main areas of settlement spread out from Caulfield in two arcs: south through St Kilda, Elwood, Elsternwick, Brighton, Moorabbin and right down to Frankston; east through Toorak, Malvern, Hawthorn, Kew, Balwyn to Doncaster. In Sydney the major areas of Jewish settlement are in the east and on the North Shore, in particular the suburbs of Bondi, Dover Heights, Rose Bay, Vaucluse, St Ives and Hunters Hill. In New Zealand, most Jews live in Auckland and Wellington with smaller populations in Dunedin and Christchurch. Dunedin synagogue has possibly the world's southernmost Jewish congregation.Jews in New Zealand The following is a list of prominent Oceanian Jews, arranged by country of origin. ==Australia== ===Academic figures=== *Roy Clive Abraham, linguistOxford Dictionary of National Biography *Samuel Alexander, philosopher *Phillip Blashki, successful businessman, magistrate, JP *Bernard Boas, marriage guidance counsellor, broadcaster, author of biblical treatises *Neal Ashkanasy, psychologist and emotional intelligence academic *Ron Castan, barrister and rights advocate *Sir Zelman Cowen, Governor-General (1977–1982), lawyer, university lecturer (including past appointments as Provost, Dean and Vice-Chancellor) *Linda Dessau, current Governor of Victoria, and former Family Court Judge *Marcus Einfeld, former Federal Court judge *Alan Finkel, Australia's Chief Scientist *Sir Otto Frankel, geneticistInterviews with Australian scientists *Bryan Gaensler, astronomer and former Young Australian of the Year *Fred Hilmer, academic, lawyer and businessman *David Isaacs, architect and structural engineer, musician and composer *Phillip Isaacs, architect and structural engineer *Joseph Jacobs, historian and folklorist\"Joseph Jacobs\" Northern State University, Aberdeen, S.D. *Justice Stephen Kaye, judge of the Court of Appeal *William Kaye, judge of the Supreme Court 1972–1991 *Kurt Mahler, mathematician *Robert Manne, academic and social critic *Sir Matthew Nathan, British soldier and judge, Governor of Queensland 1920–1925, after also serving as Governor of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast, Hong Kong and Natal; the Brisbane suburbs of Nathan and Nathan Heights are named after him, as is Nathan Street, in the Canberra suburb of Deakin *Bernhard Neumann, mathematician *Robert Richter, barrister and human rights advocate *Hilary L.
