It has been the strongest Democratic county in the state since 1984. This trend predates the recent swing toward the Democrats in counties influenced by college towns. The last Republican to win the county in a presidential election was Richard Nixon in 1960, and the last Republican to even get 40 percent of the county's vote was Ronald Reagan in 1984. As a measure of how strongly Democratic the county has been, Democrats easily carried it even in the national Republican landslides of 1972, 1984 and 1988. Johnson County's Democratic bent is just as pronounced at the state level. It is often the lone county to vote Democratic in statewide Republican landslides, such as Senator Chuck Grassley's re-elections in 2010 and 2016 or Governor Terry Branstad's re-election in 2014. ==Communities== ===Cities=== *Coralville *Hills *Iowa City *Lone Tree *North Liberty *Oxford *Shueyville *Solon *Swisher *Tiffin *University Heights ===Census-designated place=== *Frytown ===Other unincorporated communities=== *Amish *Elmira *Cosgrove *Morse *Oasis *River Junction *Sharon Center *Sutliff *Windham ===Ghost towns=== *Midway ===Townships=== *Big Grove *Cedar *Clear Creek *East Lucas *Fremont *Graham *Hardin *Jefferson *Liberty *Lincoln *Madison *Monroe *Newport *Oxford *Penn *Pleasant Valley *Scott *Sharon *Union *Washington ===Population ranking=== The population ranking of the following table is based on the 2020 census of Johnson County. † county seat {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Rank !City/Town/etc. !Municipal type !Population (2020 Census) |- style=\"background-color:#FFFACD;\" | 1 |† Iowa City | City | 74,828 |- style=\"background-color:#FFFACD;\" | 2 |Coralville | City | 22,318 |- style=\"background-color:#FFFACD;\" | 3 |North Liberty | City | 20,479 |- style=\"background-color:#FFFACD;\" | 4 |Tiffin | City | 4,512 |- style=\"background-color:#FFFACD;\" | 5 |Solon | City | 3,018 |- style=\"background-color:#FFFACD;\" | 6 |West Branch (mostly in Cedar County) | City | 2,509 |- style=\"background-color:#FFFACD;\" | 7 |Lone Tree | City | 1,357 |- style=\"background-color:#FFFACD;\" | 8 |University Heights | City | 1,228 |- style=\"background-color:#FFFACD;\" | 9 |Swisher | City | 914 |- style=\"background-color:#FFFACD;\" | 10 |Hills | City | 863 |- style=\"background-color:#FFFACD;\" | 11 |Shueyville | City | 731 |- style=\"background-color:#FFFACD;\" | 12 |Oxford | City | 722 |- style=\"background-color:#F0FFF0;\" | 13 |Frytown | CDP | 193 |} ==Notable natives== *John T.
