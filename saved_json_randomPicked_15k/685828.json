He has a sister, Jessica, and graduated from Columbia University. ==Career== Galligan's first major and most widely seen role was as Billy Peltzer in the 1984 film Gremlins. Following the first Gremlins film, he starred in Nothing Lasts Forever, which was never released. In 1988, he starred as Mark Loftmore in the horror comedy Waxwork.
