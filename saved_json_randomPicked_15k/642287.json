 "text": "thumb|Ahauru River Bridge The Ahaura River is in the South Island of New Zealand. This river drains the western flanks of the Southern Alps and flows into the Grey River. The Ahaura and its many tributaries rise in the Lake Sumner State Forest park and enters the Grey River at the small settlement of Ahaura approximately 30 km upstream from Greymouth. It drains a huge area of land and in its lower reaches below the Haupiri confluence can have a tea- colour stain for much of the year. The reaches above the junction with the Haupiri tend to have very clear water however for much of the year. ==See also== *List of rivers of New Zealand ==References== Category:Grey District Category:Rivers of the West Coast, New Zealand Category:Rivers of New Zealand",
