 "text": "Sullivan County is a county in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2020 census, the population was 78,624. The county seat is Monticello. The county's name honors Major General John Sullivan, who was labeled at the time as a hero in the American Revolutionary War in part due to his successful campaign of genocide against the Iroquois (see Sullivan Expedition). The county was the site of hundreds of Borscht Belt hotels and resorts, which had their heyday from the 1920s through the 1970s. In 2010, the state's center of population was at the southern edge of Sullivan County. ==History== When the Province of New York established its first twelve counties in 1683, the present Sullivan County was part of Ulster County. In 1809, Sullivan County was split from Ulster County. In the late 19th century, the Industrial Revolution and the advent of factories driven by water power along the streams and rivers led to an increase in population attracted to the jobs. Hamlets enlarged into towns. As industry restructured, many of those jobs left before the middle of the twentieth century. The economy changed again after that, shifting to a more tourist-based variety and benefiting from resorts established by European Jewish immigrants and their descendants in what became called the Borscht Belt of the 20th century. Resort hotels featured a wide variety of entertainers, some nationally known. At the beginning of this period, visitors traveled to the area by train, and later by automobile. The area's natural resources also provided a setting for numerous summer camps frequented by the children of immigrants and their descendants. ==Geography== thumb|right|250px|Swan Lake thumb|250px|right|Hamlet of Grahamsville According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.9%) is water.
