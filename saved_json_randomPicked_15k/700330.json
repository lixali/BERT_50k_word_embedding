A typical method of preparation is to juice limes, and combine the juice with simple syrup or honey syrup, along with some additional water and perhaps more sugar or honey. Vodka or white tequila can be added to make a limeade cocktail. Most major beverage companies now offer their own brand of limeade, such as A.G. Barr of Glasgow and Newman's Own since 2004, with Minute Maid introducing a cherry limeade drink in response to the popularity of limeade. Sonic Drive-In uses Sprite to create its popular cherry limeade. Limeade is popular in tropical countries such as Jamaica where limes are common. It is one of the most popular drinks in India and Pakistan and is known as nimbu paani or limbu pani; lemons can also be used for nimbu paani. Limeade is also widely available in Thailand and other parts of Southeast Asia due to the abundance of limes and relative rarity of lemons, as lemons are not a native species. A Thai-styled limeade tastes salty, and sometimes does not have any sugar. == See also == * Lemonade * Lemon-lime drink * List of juices * List of lemonade topics * List of soft drink flavors == References == == External links == * Mint Limeade recipe * All Recipes' Limeade recipe Category:Cold drinks Category:Limes (fruit) Category:Citrus drinks",
