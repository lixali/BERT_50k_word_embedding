It orbits in the same region of space as the Hygiea asteroid family, though it is actually an unrelated interloper. However, its geometric albedo of is too high, and it is of the wrong spectral class to be part of the dark carbonaceous Hygiea family. It is listed as a member of the Hecuba group of asteroids that orbit near the 2:1 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter. Hekate was the 100th asteroid to be discovered, by Canadian-American astronomer J. C. Watson (his fourth discovery) on July 11, 1868. It is named after Hecate, the goddess of witchcraft in Greek mythology, but its name also commemorates it as the hundredth asteroid, as hekaton is Greek for 'hundred'. A Hekatean occultation of a star was observed on July 14, 2003, from New Zealand. ==See also== *List of minor planets: 1â€“1000 *100000 Astronautica ==References== == External links == * * Category:S-type asteroids (SMASS) Category:S-type asteroids (Tholen) Category:Hygiea asteroids Hekate Hekate Hekate 18680711 Category:Objects observed by stellar occultation",
