Its first public version, Sketch 0.5.0, was released on October 31, 1998. As claimed on its website, \"Skencil is implemented almost completely in Python, a very high- level, object oriented, interpreted language, with the rest written in C for speed.\" Version 0.6.17 of Skencil was released in 2005, and a preview 1.0 alpha was released in 2010 by sK1 project team. It has versions compatible with Linux on the i386, DEC Alpha, m68k, PowerPC and SPARC architectures, with FreeBSD, with Solaris, with IRIX64 6.4, and with AIX. Future plans had included porting the user interface from Tk to GTK+, a multiple document interface, and multi-font, fully integrated multiline text.
