 "text": "\"Bridge over Troubled Water\" is a song by the American folk duo Simon & Garfunkel, released in January 1970 as the second single from their fifth studio album, Bridge over Troubled Water (1970). It was composed by Paul Simon and produced by Simon & Garfunkel and Roy Halee. \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" features lead vocals by Art Garfunkel and a piano accompaniment influenced by gospel music, with a \"Wall of Sound\"-style production. It was the last song recorded for the album, but the first completed. The instrumentation, provided by the Wrecking Crew, was recorded in California, while Simon and Garfunkel's vocals were recorded in New York. Simon felt Garfunkel should sing solo, an invitation Garfunkel initially declined. Session musician Larry Knechtel performs piano, with Joe Osborn playing bass guitar and Hal Blaine on drums. The song won five awards at the 13th Annual Grammy Awards in 1971, including Grammy Award for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. It is Simon & Garfunkel's most successful single, and it is often considered their signature song; it topped the US Billboard Hot 100 chart for six weeks, and also reached number one in the United Kingdom, Canada, France and New Zealand. It reached the top five in eight other countries, eventually selling over six million copies worldwide. It became one of the most performed songs of the 20th century, covered by over 50 artists, including Elvis Presley, Aretha Franklin and Johnny Cash. It is ranked number 66 on Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. ==Background== \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" was composed by Paul Simon in early 1969; the song came to him very quickly, so much so that he asked himself: \"Where did that come from? It doesn't seem like me.\" The title concept was inspired by Claude Jeter's line \"I'll be your bridge over deep water if you trust in my name,\" which Jeter sang with his group, the Swan Silvertones, in the 1959 song \"Mary Don't You Weep.\"Sisario, Ben. \"Claude Jeter, Gospel Singer With Wide Influence, Dies at 94 \", The New York Times, January 10, 2009. Accessed January 11, 2009. According to gospel producer and historian Anthony Heilbut, Simon acknowledged his debt to Jeter in person, and handed Jeter a check. Simon named Johann Sebastian Bach's \"O Sacred Head, Now Wounded\" as inspiration for parts of the melody. Simon wrote the song initially on guitar but transposed it to the piano to reflect the gospel influence and suit Garfunkel's voice. Simon told his partner, Art Garfunkel, that Garfunkel should sing it alone, the \"white choirboy way\", though Simon adds harmony on the final verse. Garfunkel felt it was not right for him; he liked Simon's falsetto on the demo and suggested that Simon sing. At the suggestion of Garfunkel and producer Roy Halee, Simon wrote an extra verse and a \"bigger\" ending, though he felt it was less cohesive with the earlier verses.Kingston, Victoria, Simon and Garfunkel: the Definitive Biography, Sidgwick & Jackson, UK, 1996 p.101-02 The final verse was written about Simon's then-wife Peggy Harper, who had noticed her first gray hairs (\"Sail on, silvergirl\"). It does not refer to a drug abuser's hypodermic needle, as is sometimes claimed. The verse was Garfunkel's idea, but Simon reportedly did not like it. \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" was the final track recorded for the album but the first completed, with an additional two weeks of post- production. Simon initially composed the song in G major, but arranger and composer Jimmie Haskell transposed the song to E-flat major to suit Garfunkel's voice. The song's instrumental parts were recorded in August 1969 in California, to make it easier for Garfunkel to go to Mexico to film Catch-22. Simon wanted a gospel piano sound, and hired session musician Larry Knechtel. Joe Osborn played two separate bass tracks, one high and the other low. A string section entering in the third verse completed the arrangement. The drums were played by Hal Blaine in an echo chamber to achieve a hall effect and Los Angeles session percussionist Gary Coleman played the Vibraphone. The arranger Ernie Freeman labelled his string arrangement as \"Like a Pitcher of Water\". Simon and Garfunkel returned to New York in November 1969 to record the vocals. The vocal style in \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" was inspired by Phil Spector's technique in \"Old Man River\" by The Righteous Brothers. Simon said it sounded like the Beatles' \"Let It Be\", stating in a Rolling Stone interview: \"They are very similar songs, certainly in instrumentation.\" As their relations frayed preceding their 1970 breakup, Simon began to feel jealous that he allowed Garfunkel to sing it solo: ==Personnel== * Art Garfunkel – lead vocals * Paul Simon – backing vocals * Larry Knechtel – piano * Joe Osborn – bass guitar * Hal Blaine – drums and percussion * Gary Coleman – vibraphone * Jimmie Haskell, Ernie Freeman – string arrangements ==Commercial performance== Despite the song's five-minute length, Columbia decided to release \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" for play on pop radio. AM radio had previously played Bob Dylan's \"Like a Rolling Stone\" in 1965, despite its running over the conventional three-minute playtime limit. This figured in Columbia's decision to release the five minute version of \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" as a single. It reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart on February 28, 1970, and stayed at the top of the chart for six weeks. \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" also topped the adult contemporary chart in the US for six weeks.Whitburn, Joel (1996). The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, 6th Edition (Billboard Publications) Billboard ranked it as the No. 1 song for 1970.Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1970 The song was certified Gold for over one million copies in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America, and sold over six million copies worldwide. == Awards == The single won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Contemporary Song, and Best Arrangement, Instrumental and Vocals in the Grammy Awards of 1971, with its album also winning Album of the Year. ==Charts and certifications== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !scope=\"col\"| Chart (1970–71) !scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- !scope=\"row\" |- !scope=\"row\" |- !scope=\"row\" | Canada 100 (RPM) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- !scope=\"row\" | Canada Adult Contemporary (RPM) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- !scope=\"row\" |- !scope=\"row\" |- !scope=\"row\" |- !scope=\"row\" |- !scope=\"row\" |- !scope=\"row\" |- !scope=\"row\" |- !scope=\"row\" |- ! scope=\"row\"|South Africa (Springbok Radio) | style=\"text- align:center;\"|4 |- !scope=\"row\" |- !scope=\"row\" |- !scope=\"row\" |- !scope=\"row\" |- !scope=\"row\" |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1970) ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank |- |Australia | style=\"text-align:center;\"|5 |- |Canada | style=\"text- align:center;\"|1 |- |Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) | style=\"text- align:center;\"|29 |- |Netherlands (Single Top 100) | style=\"text- align:center;\"|30 |- |UK | style=\"text-align:center;\"|5 |- |US Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |} ===All-time charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !

In total, \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" spent seventeen weeks in the UK top 40 (concluding on June 27). ==Covers== \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" has been covered by over 50 artists, including Elvis Presley and Willie Nelson. Merry Clayton recorded a version in gospel style on her 1970 album Gimme Shelter.

The single was certified gold by the RIAA selling two million copies and later won the Grammy Award for Best Female R&B; Vocal Performance in the 1972 awards. The single is 3:18 in length.

Franklin also debuted her version at the 1971 Grammy Awards. ===Elvis Presley=== Elvis Presley recorded it in Nashville on June 5, 1970, and it was released on the 1970 album That's the Way It Is (with a false audience fade-out). He included it in his set list for his next engagement in Las Vegas, which included the filming of the 1970 documentary Elvis: That's the Way It Is, and the song was included in the original theatrical release (included version is from the August 11 dinner show). During that summer season in Vegas, Paul Simon attended one of the shows, and, after seeing Elvis perform the song, he was reported to have said, \"That's it, we might as well all give up now.\" Presley continued to use this song throughout his live performances, including his final live appearance in Indianapolis on June 26, 1977. Another live performance was seen in the Golden Globe-winning documentary Elvis on Tour, filmed at the Greensboro Coliseum in Greensboro, North Carolina, on April 14, 1972. Elvis even sang it at one of his Madison Square Garden Shows back in June 1972. On the studio version, Robert Matthew Watson wrote in his book Heartbreak Hotel: \"Presley's outstanding singing is not disguised. This is a fabulous version, burning with sincerity and power, and finding depths not revealed by the composers.\" ===Linda Clifford=== Linda Clifford, Curtis Mayfield's protegée signed on his Curtom label, released an up-tempo disco version of \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" on her album Let Me Be Your Woman in March 1979. This epic version (10:20 in length) was produced by Gil Askey (jazz trumpet player and musical director for many Motown acts) and mixed by Jimmy Simpson, brother of Valerie Simpson from Ashford and Simpson. The song has two originalities, the first one being a 132 bpm tempo (considered the ideal tempo for disco dancing) when the Simon and Garfunkel original is 82 bpm and Aretha Franklin's cover is 76 bpm. It was the first time that this song was covered with a fast tempo. It also has a highly original \"Brazilian cuica on a disco beat\" break. It became a US disco number 11, pop number 41, R&B; number 49 and UK number 28. ===P.J.B. featuring Hannah and Her Sisters version=== In 1991, P.J.B. featuring Hannah and Her Sisters, a UK group assembled by British songwriter, record producer and author Pete Bellotte and fronted by British singer Hannah Jones, released a dance cover of \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" which reached number 21 on the UK Singles Chart.
