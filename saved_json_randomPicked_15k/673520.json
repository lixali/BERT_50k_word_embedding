 "text": "thumb|right|Departments of Ivory Coast. Colours indicate regions and autonomous districts Departments of Ivory Coast () are currently the third- level administrative subdivision of the country. Each of the 31 second-level regions of Ivory Coast is divided into two or more departments. (The autonomous districts are containing departments, but have a specific status.) Each department is divided into two or more sub-prefectures. Since 2020, there are 109 departments of Ivory Coast. Departments were first created in 1959.Sato (2003).Tice (1974). During their existence, they have been first-, second-, and third-level administrative subdivisions. ==Current departments== 350px|thumb|right There are currently 109 departments of Ivory Coast. The departments are as follows: ==History== ===1961–69=== left|thumb|Departments of Ivory Coast in 1961–63. thumb|Departments of Ivory Coast in 1963–69. Departments were established in 1961 and were the original first-level administrative subdivision of independent Ivory Coast.At independence in 1960, Ivory Coast was informally divided into 19 traditional cercles, but the cercles were not official administrative subdivisions. Initially, there were just four departments: Centre, Nord, Sud-Est, and Sud-Ouest. In 1963, two more departments were created: Est was created by dividing Sud-Est, and Centre- Ouest) was created by dividing Sud-Ouest. As a result of the divisions, Sud- Est was renamed Sud and Sud-Ouest was renamed Ouest. ===1969: 24 new departments=== In 1969, the six departments were abolished and in their place 24 new departments were created. The following table illustrates how the old departments were divided into the new departments: thumb|left|The 24 new departments that were created in 1969 (in background the 6 former departments). These boundaries were consistent until departments began to be divided in 1974. Due to a lack of government resources, the 1969 changes were not fully implemented until 1974. ===Subsequent divisions and relegation to second-level=== From 1974 onward, new departments were occasionally created through division of pre-existing departments. New departments were created in 1974 (2), 1980 (8), 1988 (15), and 1995 (1). In 1997, when there were 50 departments, regions were created, which supplanted departments as the first- level administrative subdivision. As a result, the 50 departments became second-level divisions. More departments were created in 1998 (8), 2005 (12), 2008 (11), and 2009 (9). By the time of the late-2011 reorganisation of the subdivisions of Ivory Coast, there were 90 departments in 19 regions. ===2011 subdivision reorganisation=== In the 2011 reorganisation of the subdivisions of Ivory Coast, five new departments were created, bringing the total to 95. More significantly, however, districts were created as a new first-level division. As a result, regions became second-level subdivisions and the 95 departments became third-level subdivisions. ===Post-2011 changes=== Since the 2011 reorganisation, 14 more departments have been created, bringing the total number to 109. Twelve departments were created in 2012, one in 2013, and one was created in 2020. ==Names and governance== Departments are named after the city or town that serves as the seat of the department. In most cases, this is the most populous settlement in the department. Each department is headed by a prefect, who is appointed by the council of ministers (cabinet) of the national government.Loi n° 2014-451 du 05 août 2014 portant orientation de l'organisation générale de l'Administration Territoriale. For departments that house regional capitals, the prefect of the department is the same individual as the prefect of the region, though the two offices of prefect remain distinct.Ordonnance n° 2011-262 du 28 septembre 2011 portant orientation de l'organisation générale de l'administration territoriale de l'Etat. Each department is divided into two or more sub-prefectures, which serve as fourth- level administrative subdivisions. There are currently 510 sub-prefectures in the country. ==Current departments by district and region== Below are the departments divided by district and region with the establishment year of the departments in parentheses. ===Abidjan Autonomous District=== *Abidjan DepartmentThe boundaries of Abidjan Department and Abidjan Autonomous District are the same.
