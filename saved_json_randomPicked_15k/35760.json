At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Paulus without colleague (or, less frequently, year 1271 Ab urbe condita). The denomination 518 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. == Events == === By place === ==== Byzantine Empire ==== * July 9 - Emperor Anastasius I dies childless at Constantinople, age 88, after a 27-year reign in which he has abolished the sale of offices, reformed taxation, and perfected the empire's monetary system, but antagonized some with his heretical Monophysite religious policies.
