 "text": "Scotts Bluff County is a county on the western border of the U.S. state of Nebraska. As of the 2020 United States Census, the population was 36,084. Its county seat is Gering, and its largest city is Scottsbluff. Scotts Bluff County is included in the Scottsbluff, NE Micropolitan Statistical Area. In the Nebraska license plate system, Scotts Bluff County is represented by the prefix 21, since the county had the twenty-first-largest number of registered vehicles registered when the state's license-plate system was established in 1922. ==History== The county is named for a prominent bluff that served as a landmark for 19th-century pioneers traveling along the Oregon Trail. Scotts Bluff was named for Hiram Scott, a Rocky Mountain Fur Company trapper who died nearby around 1828. Washington Irving claimed that, after being injured and abandoned, Scott had crawled sixty miles only to perish near the bluff that now bears his name. The bluff is now managed by the National Park Service as Scotts Bluff National Monument. The town of Gering was founded at the base of the bluff in 1887, and the city of Scottsbluff was founded across the North Platte River in 1900. Joined by the river, the former transportation highway, the two cities now form Nebraska's 7th-largest urban area. ==Transportation== Scotts Bluff County Airport (BFF) is Nebraska's third-busiest airport in terms of passenger boardings. ==Geography== Scotts Bluff County is on the west side of Nebraska. Its west boundary line abuts the east boundary line of the state of Wyoming. The North Platte River flows east-southeastward through the upper central part of the county. The county's terrain consists of arid rolling hills, about half of which is dedicated to agriculture. The county's lands slope to the east-southeast.Scotts Bluff County NE Google Maps (accessed 26 January 2019)\"Find an Altitude\" Google Maps (accessed 26 January 2019) The county has an area of , of which is land and (0.8%) is water. thumb|upright=1.5|Road map of Scotts Bluff County ===Major highways=== * 20px U.S. Highway 26 * 20px Nebraska Highway 29 * 20px Nebraska Highway 71 * 20px Nebraska Highway 92 ===Adjacent counties=== * Sioux County – north * Box Butte County – northeast * Morrill County – east * Banner County – south * Goshen County, Wyoming – west ===Protected areas=== * Kiowa State Wildlife Management AreaKiowa State Wildlife Management Area, Morrill NE Google Maps (accessed 26 January 2019) * Lake Minatare State Recreation AreaLake Minatare State Recreation Area Google Maps (accessed 26 January 2019) * North Platte National Wildlife Refuge * Scotts Bluff National Monument * Wildcat Hills State Recreation AreaWildcat Hills State Recreation Area Google Maps (accessed 26 January 2019) ==Demographics== As of the 2000 United States Census, there were 36,951 people, 14,887 households, and 10,167 families in the county.
