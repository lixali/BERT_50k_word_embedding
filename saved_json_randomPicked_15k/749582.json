 "text": "Uunijuusto is a Finnish dish made from cow's colostrum, the first milk of a calved cow, by adding a pinch of salt (some 0.5 grams per a litre of milk) and by baking the milk in an oven (30 minutes in 150 degrees Celsius, and for a few moments in 250 degrees to get the color). Sometimes uunijuusto is also made from ordinary milk and eggs. In Sweden, the dish is named kalvdans (calve's dance). The word uunijuusto literally means \"oven cheese\", but uunijuusto is not properly a cheese. Uunijuusto is typically eaten for dessert with berries (often cloudberries) or jam or mehukeitto which is a sort of soup made from fresh berries such as lingonberries or redcurrants. ==See also== * Kalvdans * List of dairy products * List of desserts ==References== Category:Finnish desserts Category:Finnish cheeses Category:Dairy products",
