 "text": "\"Last Christmas\" is a song by British pop duo Wham!, originally released in December 1984 on CBS Records internationally and as a double A-side on Epic Records with \"Everything She Wants\" in the UK. Described as a \"high watermark of mid-80s British synthpop songcraft\", it was written and produced by George Michael, and has been covered by many artists since its original release. Upon its initial release in 1984, \"Last Christmas\" spent five consecutive weeks at number two in the UK Singles Chart—it was held off the top spot at Christmas by Band Aid's \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" (on which Michael also performed). After many chart runs in subsequent years, which included three more weeks at number two, and which saw the recording become part of RCA Records' catalogue, the song finally reached number one in the UK Singles Chart on New Year's Day 2021 (chart week ending date 7 January 2021), more than 36 years after its initial release. In doing so, it became the fifth UK number one single for the duo and surpassed Tony Christie's almost 16 year- long record for the longest time a single has taken to top the UK Singles Chart after its initial release with \"(Is This The Way To) Amarillo?\" in March 2005, which had itself taken 33 years 4 months to top the chart (with Peter Kay, though credited, only actually appearing in the video). Prior to it reaching number one, \"Last Christmas\" had for many years held the record as the highest-selling single never to top the charts by the Official Charts Company (OCC) with 1.9 million copies sold (not including streams). This record is now held by \"Moves like Jagger\" by Maroon 5 featuring Christina Aguilera. The tune reached number one in the UK after it was streamed 9.2 million times in the last week of 2020 and sold 1,555 downloads, resulting in a total of 40,149 combined sales. Outside the United Kingdom, the song topped the charts in Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Slovenia, and Sweden and peaked within the top ten of the charts in several countries including Australia and the United States. Wham! donated all of their royalties to relief efforts for the Ethiopian famine. In a UK-wide poll in December 2012, it was voted eighth on the ITV television special The Nation's Favourite Christmas Song\"The Nation's Favourite Christmas Song\". ITV. 22 December 2012. and was voted most popular song of the 1980s in Channel 5's Christmas 2020 countdown Britain's Favourite 80's Songs. It was the most-played Christmas song of the 21st century in the UK until it was overtaken by \"Fairytale of New York\" in 2015. ==Background and composition== The song has a tempo of 107 beats per minute. It is written in the key of D♭ Major. ==Development== \"Last Christmas\" had its beginnings in 1984, while George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley were visiting Michael's parents. It was written by Michael in his childhood bedroom. Michael played Ridgeley the introduction and chorus melody to \"Last Christmas\", which Ridgeley later called \"a moment of wonder\". ===Recording=== The song was recorded in August 1984, at Advision Studios, London, England. George Michael wrote, performed, produced and played every single instrument on the track. With a LinnDrum drum machine, a Roland Juno-60 synth and sleigh bells, they began recording the song in the summer, Michael having \"plastered [the studio] in Christmas decorations to set the mood\". The only other people in the studio were engineer Chris Porter and two assistants. According to Porter, lyrically \"you've got the happiness of the rhythm track, but against that you've got the sadness of the unrequited love\". == Chart performance == === United Kingdom === thumb|upright=1.00|Back sleeve of 1985 UK release, titled Christmas 85 Wham! already had two number one singles on the UK Singles Chart during 1984, and news that they were planning a Christmas single meant that a battle for the coveted Christmas number one spot in Britain seemed set to be between Wham! and the year's other big act, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, who had achieved a third No. 1 in early December with \"The Power of Love\". However, the Band Aid single written by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, produced the No. 1 single \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\", while Wham!'s offering peaked at No. 2 for much of the period. Wham! donated all \"Last Christmas/Everything She Wants\" royalties to the Ethiopian famine. In subsequent years, the song entered the UK top 40 on 15 occasions, reaching the top 10 no less than 6 times (including a run of 5 consecutive years between 2016 and 2020). In 1985 and 2017 it equalled its best ever chart position of number two, before finally topping the charts on 1 January 2021, 36 years after its original 1984 release. In the process, \"Last Christmas\" achieved the chart record for the longest time taken for a single to peak at the top of the UK Singles Chart after its first release, a feat that had previously been held by \"(Is This The Way To) Amarillo? by Tony Christie, which topped the chart in March 2005, 33 years and 4 months after its initial release in November 1971. Coincidentally with the sudden death of George Michael on December 25, 2016, \"Last Christmas\" reach number 7 on the UK Singles Chart for 5 weeks (8 December 2016 - 5 January 2017). On January 8, 2021, \"Last Christmas\" became the very first record to disappear completely from number one spot, exiting the Official Charts Company Top 100 chart with no placing on the chart (week ending 14 January 2021). As \"Last Christmas\" replaced \"Don't Stop Me Eatin'\" by LadBaby, which had dropped down the singles chart to number 78 on January 1, it was the first time in chart history that two back-to-back number ones had disappeared not only from the BBC Radio 1 Top 40, but the Top 75 as well {|class=\"sort wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%\" |+ UK Singles Chart |- !

The single was originally released in two different formats in Japan with different cover art, a 7-inch and 12-inch vinyl (Long version) both with \"Credit Card Baby\" as their B-side. The former entered the top 20 of the Oricon Singles Chart peaking at No. 15, while the latter reached No. 47.

In the Netherlands, the song never reached No. 1, peaking at No. 2 in January 1985 (behind Band Aid's \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\"). In the Dutch Singles Top 100 (one of three charts in the Netherlands that claims to be the \"official\" chart, but it is the only one that is not broadcast and remains unpublished except on its own official web page), the song has now entered on 16 different occasions, including every year since 2006. Its highest position after 1984 was No. 4 (during the 2016 and 2018 Christmas season).http://dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Wham!&titel;=Last+Christmas&cat;=s In the Dutch Mega Top 50 (which was first published in 1993), the song re- appeared in 1997, 2000, 2007, 2008, and 2013. \"Last Christmas\" was not released commercially as a single in the United States until November 2014, when it was made available on 12\" vinyl as a Record Store Day exclusive. Since then, the song has re-entered the Billboard Holiday Songs Chart on a regular basis, peaking at No. 3 on 7 December 2019.Wham!'s 1984 Classic 'Last Christmas' Hits Billboard Hot 100's Top 40 for First Time - Billboard As of 25 November 2016, total US sales of the digital track stand at 751,000 downloads according to Nielsen SoundScan, placing it 10th on the list of all-time best- selling Christmas/holiday digital singles in US SoundScan history.

In December 2017, 28 December 2018 and December 2019 \"Last Christmas\" reached No. 1 in the Swedish singles chart. ==Music video== The video to \"Last Christmas\" directed by Andrew Morahan, shows Wham! members George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley accompanying girlfriends to see friends at an unspecified ski resort cottage: the cable-car that can be seen in two shots is from Saas-Fee, Switzerland, where the video was filmed. It becomes clear early on that the character of Ridgeley's girlfriend (played by model Kathy Hill) was previously in a relationship with Michael and that the song is aimed at her. She can be spotted throughout the video by the fact that she is usually wearing red, but everyone else is wearing more muted colors. There is a brief flashback to a prior Christmas, showing Michael's character presenting Kathy Hill's character with a jewelled brooch. In the present time, Ridgeley is wearing the brooch, suggesting that Hill gave the same gift (perhaps by regifting it) to her new love after she and Michael parted ways. When Hill wears the brooch after receiving it from Michael's character, it is \"right side up\", and when Ridgeley's character wears it, he wears it \"upside down\". On numerous occasions, Michael presents a thoughtful expression, suggesting his conflicting emotions. As Michael is decorating the Christmas tree some decoration falls to the floor where Michael's ex-girlfriend is sitting and the ex-couple shares a few seconds of a knowing look at each other. Her seeming indifference to Ridgeley's open displays of affection makes the viewer wonder if Ridgeley's heart is the next to be broken. At the end of the video, everyone leaves the cottage and when the group get out of the cable-car, they are all properly \"paired off\" with Michael and his new girlfriend looking happy. The video also featured the duo's erstwhile backing singers Pepsi and Shirlie. It has since been rescanned in 4K definition from the original 35mm film. The music video, originally shot on film, was released on 13 December 2019 in 4K Ultra HD resolution. The music video's original film director Andy Morahan found the original 35mm rushes and worked closely with teams at Cinelab London and VFX artist Russ Shaw at Nice Biscuits post production to recreate the video using the higher-resolution film. ==Charts== === Weekly charts === {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !

In some countries, the longer edit (4:34) of \"Last Christmas\" from 1984 was used on side two of the second 12-inch. The only difference between the 1988 and 1989 reissues is the text (Christmas '88\" and Christmas '89\") on the back of the record. == In other media == The film Last Christmas (2019) prominently features the music of George Michael, including this song and a previously unreleased track. The song is featured in the video game Just Dance 2017 as a duet between two dancers, one of whom is dressed as Santa Claus. ==Plagiarism allegations== On behalf of the writers of the song \"Can't Smile Without You\", made popular by Barry Manilow, publishing company Dick James Music sued Michael for plagiarism in the mid-1980s, claiming that \"Last Christmas\" lifted its melody from the former. The case was dismissed when a musicologist presented 60-odd songs from the past century that had a comparable chord sequence and melody. ==Whigfield version== In the UK, the following single planned after \"Close to You\" was \"Big Time\"; however, it was suggested that Whigfield should record a version of \"Last Christmas\" to go with the release of \"Big Time\", as a double A-side single. The single was also released as a double A-side single in Germany with \"Close to You\". In other countries, \"Last Christmas\" was released on its own with various remixes. The single reached number 21 in the UK, which was Whigfield's final release on Systematic Records. It also features on various Special Edition versions of her debut album Whigfield and also on Whigfield II. The EP was released on 10 November 1995 in Australia. A UK single was released on 3 December 1995. Whigfield's cover of \"Last Christmas\" was a moderate success in Europe. It managed to climb into the Top 10 in both Denmark and Spain, peaking at number 6 and 5. Additionally, it was a Top 20 hit in Finland and a Top 30 hit in Ireland, Scotland and the United Kingdom. In the latter, the single was released as a double single with \"Big Time\". It peaked at number 21 in its first week at the UK Singles Chart, on 10 December 1995. It was also a Top 40 hit in Belgium, as well as on the European Hot 100 Singles, where the song reached number 38. The music video for Whigfield's cover was directed by Italian director Giacomo De Simone. It features Whigfield performing the song in a winter landscape. ===Track listing=== {|style = \"border: 0px;\" |- ! 12\" single, Italy (1995) ! !!

Nolan Feeney of Time echoed those sentiments, noting that \"Last Christmas\" is \"the kind of brokenhearted yet warm and sweet song [Jepsen] excels at\". Jackson McHenry of Vulture applauded Jepsen for her straightforward approach to the song and avoiding the \"vocal gymnastics\" that bog down some Christmas covers. A more critical review came from music blog Popcrush, who deemed the cover overproduced, saying \"The slick production is a disservice to both Carly's vocals and the original's emotional heft.\". {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |+ !
