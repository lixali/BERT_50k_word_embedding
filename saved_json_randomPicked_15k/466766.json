 "text": "The City of Boroondara () is a local government area in Victoria, Australia. It is located in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. It was formed in June 1994 from the amalgamation of the Cities of Kew, Camberwell and Hawthorn. It has an area of . In June 2018 the City had a population of 181,289. Boroondara was rated ninth of 590 Australian local government areas in the BankWest Quality of Life Index 2008, and first in a 2013 Victoria-wide community satisfaction survey. ==History== This area was originally occupied by the Wurundjeri Indigenous Australians of the Kulin nation. In 1837, John Gardiner (after whom Gardiners Creek was named) and his family were the first Europeans to settle in the area. Robert Hoddle surveyed the area in 1837 and declared it the \"Parish of Boroondara\". The area was densely wooded, so he took a word from the Woiwurrung language (as spoken by the Wurundjeri), meaning \"where the ground is thickly shaded\". The first Local Government body was the Boroondara District Road Board, formed on 11 July 1854 and incorporating the areas which were to become the City of Hawthorn, City of Kew and City of Camberwell. Hawthorn and Kew were created as separate municipalities in 1860 and the remaining area of the Road Board became Shire of Boroondara on 17 November 1871, which later became the City of Camberwell. Accessed at State Library of Victoria, La Trobe Reading Room. The three municipalities were amalgamated in June 1994 to create the City of Boroondara. Existing councillors from the three municipalities were replaced initially by three commissioners - David Glanville (chair), David Thomas and Marion Macleod. The commissioners were in turn replaced by ten councillors following elections in 1996. ==Local government== Boroondara City Council is the third tier of government and deals with services such as waste and recycling collection, leisure centres, building and planning permits and approvals, roads, drainage, health services, youth services, children's services, food safety, parks and gardens, library services, pets, street parking permits and the collection of rates and charges. ===Current composition and election method=== Boroondara City Council is composed of eleven councillors, each representing one of eleven wards. On Thursday 9 July 2020, the Minister for Local Government formally announced a change to Boroondaraâ€™s electoral structure. This change follows a review by the Victorian Electoral Commission (VEC), which was completed in June 2019. This change included an increase in ward and councillor numbers from 10 to 11. The new 11th ward is named Riversdale Ward, and is located to the south-west where it shares a boundary with Glenferrie, Junction and Gardiner Wards. This addition resulted in a number of boundary changes across the municipality. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic threatened to disrupt the local elections, with some arguing that the inability to campaign in-person would benefit incumbents with name-recognition, or resource rich candidates who could invest in letter box campaigns with leaflets. A decision was made, on public health grounds, that it was safe to proceed with the elections and voters were only able to return their ballots via postal voting. All councillors are elected for a fixed four-year term of office, with the most recent election being held in October 2020. Councillors-elect were sworn-in at a Special Meeting of Council on Monday 16 November 2020. The current mayor is Cr Garry Thompson. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=\"2\"|Party!!Councillors |- | | | Independent | align=right | 5 |- | | | Liberal | align=right | 5 |- | | | Greens | align=right | 1 |- | colspan=\"2\"|Total | align=right | 11 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Ward!!Suburbs!! colspan=\"2\" | Party!!Councillor!!Elected |- | Bellevue | Balwyn North, Kew East | | | Independent | Jim Parke | 2012 |- | Cotham | Kew, Balwyn, Balwyn North, Deepdene | | | Liberal | Felicity Sinfield | 2016 |- | Gardiner | Glen Iris, Hawthorn East, Hawthorn, Camberwell | | | Independent | Victor Franco | 2020 |- | Glenferrie | Hawthorn, Kew | | | Greens | Wes Gault | 2020 |- | Junction | Camberwell, Hawthorn East, Canterbury | | | Independent | Di Gillies | 2020 |- | Lynden | Camberwell, Glen Iris, Canterbury | | | Liberal | Lisa Hollingsworth | 2016 |- | Maling | Canterbury, Surrey Hills, Balwyn | | | Independent | Jane Addis | 2012 |- | Maranoa | Balwyn, Balwyn North, Mont Albert North | | | Liberal | Cynthia Watson | 2016 |- | Riversdale | Hawthorn, Hawthorn East | | | Independent | Susan Biggar | 2020 |- | Solway | Ashburton, Glen Iris | | | Liberal | Garry Thompson | 2016 |- | Studley | Kew, Hawthorn | | | Liberal | Nick Stavrou | 2020 |- |} === Past councillors === Single member wards, 1996-2019 {| class=\"wikitable\" !colspan=\"25\" |Previous councillors (grey shading indicates election year) |- !Ward !style=\"background-color: silver;\" |96 !97 !98 !style=\"background-color: silver;\" |99 !00 !01 !style=\"background-color: silver;\" |02 !03 !style=\"background-color: silver;\" |04 !05 !06 !07 !style=\"background-color: silver;\" |08 !09 !10 !11 !style=\"background-color: silver;\" |12 !13 !14 !15 !style=\"background-color: silver;\" |16 !17 !18 !19 |- |Bellevue | colspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Eric Risstrom | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1. | colspan=\"4\" style=\"background- color:#dcebff; text-align: center;\" | Luke Tobin | colspan=\"4\" style=\"text- align: center;\" | Brad Miles | colspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Jim Parke |- |Cotham | colspan=\"8\" style=\"background-color:#dcebff; text-align: center;\" | Geoff Hayes | colspan=\"3\" style=\"background-color:#dcebff; text- align: center;\" | Lachlan Williams | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2. | colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color:#dcebff; text-align: center;\" | David Bloom | colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Judith Voce | colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color:#dcebff; text-align: center;\" | Felicity Sinfield |- |Gardiner | colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Will Charlton | colspan=\"18\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Coral Ross |- |Glenferrie | colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Nigel Kirby | colspan=\"9\" style=\"background-color:#dcebff; text-align: center;\" | Meredith Butler | colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Phil Meggs | colspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Steve Hurd |- |Junction | colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Lilian Weinberg | colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Martina Hayes | colspan=\"18\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Jack Wegman |- |Lynden | colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Ian Wallace | colspan=\"14\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Heinz Kreutz | colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Lisa Hollingsworth |- |Maling | colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Loreto Davey | colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | 3. | colspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Dick Menting | colspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Jane Addis |- |Maranoa | colspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Chris Pattas | colspan=\"8\" style=\"background- color:#dcebff; text-align: center;\" | Nicholas Tragas | colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Philip Mallis | colspan=\"4\" style=\"background- color:#dcebff; text-align: center;\" | Cynthia Watson |- |Solway | colspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Keith Walter | colspan=\"4\" style=\"background- color:#ffdcdc; text-align: center;\" | 4. | colspan=\"8\" style=\"background- color:#ffdcdc; text-align: center;\" | Kevin Chow | colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color:#dcebff; text-align: center;\" | Gary Thompson |- |Studley | colspan=\"3\" style=\"background-color:#dcebff; text-align: center;\" | Paula Davey | colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Judith Voce | colspan=\"16\" style=\"background-color:#dcebff; text-align: center;\" | Phillip Healey |} Liberal Labor 1\\.
