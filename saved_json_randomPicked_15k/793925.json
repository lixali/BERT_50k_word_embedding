He was raised in Elgin and graduated from Elgin High School. As an adult, he was a concert violinist in Chicago before he gave up music to become a vice president at Sears Roebuck & Co. after marrying into the family that controlled the company. His wife was Sophie Rosenwald, the sister of Julius Rosenwald, who founded Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry. He retired in 1928 to become a philanthropist and was key to the creation of the first planetarium in the Western Hemisphere, the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, which bears his name. In 1914, he had a 12,000 square foot mansion built as his house. ==References== * Category:1866 births Category:1952 deaths Category:People from Elgin, Illinois Category:American people of German-Jewish descent Category:Jews and Judaism in Chicago Category:Museum founders Category:Businesspeople from Chicago",
