 "text": "Makki ki roti is a flat unleavened bread made from corn meal (maize flour), primarily eaten in the Punjab region of India and Pakistan; and in Jammu, Himachal, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand in North India. Like most rotis in the Indian subcontinent, it is baked on a tava. Makki di roti is a signifier of Punjabi cuisine. While maize, a New World crop, was introduced to the subcontinent in the 16th century by the Portuguese, it remained a novelty of little importance until the nineteenth century, when the British introduced the American crop to the Punjab after annexing it, and farmers started planting in extensively. As the crop remains abundant in the fields of Punjab, the popularity of makki di roti then spread to other regions. Literally, makki ki roti means 'bread of maize'. Makki ki roti is yellow in color when ready, and has much less cohesive strength, which makes it difficult to handle. Makki di roti is generally made during winter and is often accompanied with saag (especially sarson da saag i.e. cooked mustard green leaves). In Himachal it is also eaten with Maah (Urad) daal. Among Dogras there are folk songs talking of Makki di roti like: \"मक्के दी रोटी मोइये , सरेआं दा साग हो , पिप्पल मरोड़ी मरोड़ी करी खाना हो ।\" Maize food items are also popular in Rajasthan and one of that is maize roti. In fact, maize is one of the staple diet of Bishnois of Rajasthan and Haryana. In Uttar Pradesh, maize roti is also eaten with ghee, butter, jaggery and pickles. In Gujarat, this dish is also known as \"Makai No Rotlo\". ==See also== * List of breads * Corn tortilla * Talo (food) ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * Category:Indian breads Category:Indian cuisine Category:Pakistani breads Category:Flatbreads Category:Unleavened breads Category:Maize dishes Category:Roti Category:Punjabi cuisine",
