It was conceived in the early 1960s as a low-risk program based on enlarging the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21F, a version of which the PRC was producing as the Chengdu J-7. The original J-8 experienced protracted development due to disruption from the Cultural Revolution; the prototypes first flew in 1969 but the design was not finalized until 1979 with the aircraft entering service in 1980. The J-8II/J-8B (NATO reporting name: Finback-B) was a major development of the J-8 and was essentially a new aircraft. The J-8II replaced the nose air intake and its shock cone with a ogival radome and lateral air intakes to create room for a modern fire-control radar, and used more powerful engines. The aircraft started development in 1982, and was cleared for production and service in 1988. The J-8II was the basis for all later major additions to the J-8 family. == Design and development == thumb|upright|Shenyang J-8I and J-8II === J-8 === By 1964, the Chengdu J-7 was inadequate to perform long-range, high-altitude interceptions. The Chinese Aeronautical Establishment held a conference on 25 October to discuss future fighters. The 601 Institute had two proposals; a twin-engined \"scaled-up\" J-7 which became the J-8, and a higher-performing single-engined option that became the Chengdu J-9. Both options were pursued. The J-8 offered lower technical risk and received higher priority and political support; the J-9 was later cancelled in 1980. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) approved the operational requirements on 17 May 1965. Huang Zhiqian and Gu Songfen became chief and vice chief designers. The programme suffered a series of disruptions through the 1970s. Huang Zhiqian, was killed in an air crash in May 1965 and replaced by Wang Nanshou. Design work was completed in September and a full-size mock-up completed and reviewed by December. The Shenyang Aircraft Factory was expected to complete a prototype by the end of 1966, but Gao Fangqi - its chief engineer - died and his successor, Liu Hongzhi, was dismissed in November 1966 during the Cultural Revolution. Development was transferred to the \"Joint J-8 Development Command\" led by Wang Xin. The construction of two prototypes was slow due to being done \"almost clandestinely\"; the first, \"001 Red\" was built from August 1967 to June 1968. 001 Red was damaged during high-speed taxiing tests on 19 December 1968, and made its first successful flight on 5 July 1969 piloted by Yin Yuhuan. Shortly afterward, the programme stalled due to the disbanding of Flight Test Command and the Shenyang's Chief Design Office The Chief Design Office was only reformed in 1979 with Gu Songfen being promoted to chief designer. From 1969 to 1979, 001 Red and 002 Red logged a total of only 1025 flights and 663 flight hours. Flight and static testing revealed several problems, including severe buffeting at transonic and supersonic speeds, overheating of the rear fuselage at supersonic speeds, engine unreliability, and airframe weaknesses. All were eventually resolved, and the design was finalized on 31 December 1979. The J-8 was already recognized as obsolescent when it formally entered service on 2 March 1980. Development of the improved J-8 I began at Shenyang in February 1978, with changes including using the SR-4 (or Type 204) radar - the first developed in the PRC - and the PL-4 air-to-air missile (AAM), both of which were still in development; the changes were approved by the State Certification Commission on 2 March 1980. Ultimately, the PL-4 failed and the PL-2B and PL-5 were used instead. The first prototype was completed on in May 1980 and destroyed on 25 June during its first engine run when a burst hydraulic line caused a fire in the engine bay; the J-8's hydraulic system was subsequently reworked. The second prototype first flew on 24 April 1981. Testing was completed in November 1984, and the aircraft was cleared for production on 27 June 1985. The J-8 I also fell short of contemporary requirements and only about 100 were built before production ended in 1987. === J-8II === thumb|A Shenyang J-8II parked on an airfield It was hoped to equip the production J-8B with an American AN/APG-66(V) radar (to be dubbed the J-8C), but this proved politically impossible after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 so the indigenous Type 208A monopulse radar fire-control radar was used initially. Although the Type 208A was an improvement over the original J-8I radar, the Type 208A did not have true beyond visual range capabilities (The detection range of the Type 208 was ) nor look-down/shoot- down ground attack capabilities, thereby falling short of the PLAAFs requirements and the redesign of the airframe. The J-8B was the early production batch of the new J-8II series. In addition to receiving a new radar, new engine and redesigned noses, cockpit and intake, the J-8B also benefited from a new head-up display, integrated inertial navigation system/Global positioning satellite system and TACAN technology. Later J-8Bs were equipped with the more robust KLJ-1 pulse-Doppler radar fire-control radar and radar warning receiver, giving the later batch BVR capabilities. The J-8B is the second Chinese aircraft with a data link, the first being the Chengdu J-7III, and it uses the Type 483 which was developed from the J-7III's Type 481 data link, to enable ground-controlled interception centres to feed directions directly to the J-8Bs autopilot for \"hands off\" interceptions. At least 30 J-8Bs have been converted by the PLA Navy to J-8D standard, with an aerial refuelling probe for use with Xian H-6DU tankers in addition to newly built J-8Ds. The most significant difference between the J-8B and J-8D is the use of the new Type-02 airframe that was heavier than the J-8B and featured uneven length wing fences. The heavier 'Type 02' airframe is able to carry a larger payload and can tolerate higher G-loadings. The new airframe also has a stiffer radome. A few minor differences between the later J-8B batches and the J-8D are the J-8Ds slightly improved avionics. The use of the KLJ-1 pulse- Doppler radar was used through the J-8Ds entire production run. Although the Type 208A was theoretically capable of using semi-active radar homing missiles and the KLJ-1 was certainly capable; PL-11(Domestic version of Italian Aspide) is only compatible with KLJ-1 as the engineers had difficulties reconciling the missile with the early Type 208A systems. An early attempt to remedy these technological shortcomings still present after the redesign of the J-8 to the J-8II was the J-8C. The project began shortly after failure to obtain American cooperation for the J-8B, so Shenyang turned to Israel and Russia instead. The J-8C was considered a 'radical' upgrade of the original J-8II with a new radar based on the Israeli Elta EL/M 2035 multi-mode pulse Doppler radar, digital fire-control system, a new 'glass' cockpit, in-flight refuelling probe and equipped with a new WP-14 Kunlun engine. These upgrades were said to 'bring the fighter into the same league as modern Russian and Western fighters such as Mikoyan MiG-29 and Dassault Mirage 2000'. The project was cancelled in the late 1990s after two prototypes were built in favour of further development of the Shenyang J-11 fighter (which is based on the Sukhoi Su-27). The J-8IIM, first flown in 1996, is a further improved version. One major improvement over the J-8II is the capable Russian-made Zhuk-8II coherent pulse-Doppler radar, 100 of which have been delivered in the 1990s. Additionally, the J-8IIM carried new multifunction displays, integrated INS/GPS navigation system, new fire-control systems, new alternators and a new electronic countermeasures suite. The J-8IIM possessed true BVR capabilities with the use of the R-27 (air-to-air missile) semi-active infrared seeker medium-ranged missile. New WP-13B turbojet engines were adopted as well. The J-8IIM has had no new orders from China or the export market, where it is offered as the F-8IIM. It was heavily marketed to Iran but ultimately was not exported anywhere. However the experience and technological achievements gained from the J-8C and F-8IIM projects were later applied by Shenyang Aircraft Company to the later J-8H/F variants. It was also during this time that the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology certified the PL-11 in 2001 after successfully test firing five missiles from the J-8II. The J-8H is equipped with IFR probe, INS/GPS, HOTAS, and an integrated ECM suite, with twin wing fences on each side of the wings that greatly increased handling ability. The J-8Ds heavier airframe is used but with modified wing fences. Production of the J-8H and the J-8D it had superseded has now ceased in favor of upgrading earlier J-8D aircraft to J-8H standards. It is uncertain if the older J-8B will be upgraded to J-8H standards given the difference in airframe. The J-8F is the most modern and capable J-8 variant currently in service and started production from 2003. The J-8H/F has inherited many of the improvements of the earlier J-8C and F-8IIM, and in some cases, has improved on them. The J-8F features a glass cockpit, a more powerful WP-13BII turbojet engine and enhanced Type 1492 radar for enhanced air-to-air capabilities with the PL-12/SD-10 MRAAM, which employs an Active radar homing (ARH) seeker, full air-to-ground and air-to-sea capabilities using the AS-17 'Krypton' anti-radar missile, and a variety of Chinese designed precision guided laser and satellite guided bombs, making it the first true Multirole combat aircraft variant of the J-8 series. The J-8F also possesses all the avionic and electronic upgrades the J-8H received. The earlier J-8B/Ds can be distinguished from later J-8H/Fs by their dark green radomes, compared to the latter's black radomes. Introduction of the more powerful WP-14 Kunlun turbojet engine for the J-8 series is planned to go under way in the coming years. The J-8F also serves in the People's Liberation Army Naval Air Force as well. A notable variant of the J-8F is the JZ-8F which has been introduced into the PLAAF in the tactical reconnaissance role. Little information has been released on the JZ-8F, other than the use of an internal camera compartment which replaces the twin 23 mm cannon, rather than a camera pod as used by the older JZ-8. In 1988, one J-8II airframe was converted into the J-8ACT an experimental fly-by-wire testbed for the J-10 programme. The J-8ACT had a shorter fuselage and a pair of canards were fixed to the side of each intake, and replaced older FBW technological demonstrators based on the older Shenyang J-6 and J-8I airframes. To date, no plans for a twin-seat J-8 design have been announced. == Operational history == There are currently over 300 J-8s of all types serving in the People's Liberation Army Air Force and People's Liberation Army Naval Air Force. The J-8 is expected to be superseded by modern Chengdu J-10 and J-11 variants in the coming years. === April 2001 incident === On 1 April 2001, a US EP-3 reconnaissance aircraft collided with a Chinese J-8D fighter jet flying near Chinese airspace about south of China. The EP-3 crew was forced to make an emergency landing on China's Hainan Island; according to Chinese officials, the pilot of the J-8D, Wang Wei, ejected, but he was never found and is presumed dead. American reconnaissance crews had been intercepted many times before, in some instances the interceptors flying as close as ten metres from the American surveillance aircraft. The crew of 24 Americans was eventually allowed to return home on 11 April. The American aircraft was not returned for another 3 months. == Variants == Data from Jane's All the World's Aircraft 2011-2012 thumb|Shenyang J-8I *J-8I (Finback-A): First flew on 24 April 1981. Improved (all-weather) version of J-8. Same powerplant, but fitted with Sichuan SR-4 fire-control radar in intake centerbody; single twin-barrelled Gsh-23L cannon on each side of lower front fuselage. 54 in service in mid-2001, by which time apparently redesignated J-8A. thumb|Shenyang J-8B at Datang Shan aviation museum *J-8B (Finback-B): Originally J-8II. All weather version, some 70% redesigned compared with J-8 I and became baseline airframe for new and upgraded variants. Design certified December 1995. Main configuration change is to \"solid\" nose and twin lateral air intakes, providing more nose space for fire- control radar and other avionics, plus increased airflow for the more powerful WP-13A II turbojets. Manufactured in small economic batches rather than continuous production. *J-8B (Finback-B) Block 02 : Late-production J-8Bs have an upgraded (KLJ-1) fire-control radar with a lookdown/shootdown mode compatible with PL-8 (Python-3) IR guided and PL-11 (domestic licensed version of Italian Aspide) semi-active radar-guided AAMs, plus a new KJ-8602 RWR antenna on the fintip. New avionics, some possibly of Israeli design or origin, including HK-13E HUD, Type 563B INS/GPS, JD-II Tacan and an RKL-800A integrated ECM suite. In service with PLA Air Force and Navy. *J-8C (Originally J-8 III): Development apparently began around 1990, but existence not noted until 2001. FIrst prototype(c/n 8301, serial 510) reportedly flew 1992 but powered by WP-13B engines instead of intended WP-14 Kunlun. Elta EL/M-2034 fire control radar initially, Chinese Type 1471 Later; integrated with the new(Type 1785A ?) stores management system; IR guided PL-8 or radar- guided PL-11 missiles. Airframe changed included fixed (but detachable) in flight refuelling probe and additional fence on each wing. Reported digital flight by wire controls and redesigned cockpit with HUD and two MFDs. At least one other prototype completed (serial 511) but, although certified in June 1994, development delays with WP-14 turbojet caused production plans to be abandoned. However, some upgrade technology graduated into later variants. *J-8D (Finback-B Mod) (originally J-8 IV): First flew on 21 November 1990, Designation of J-8Bs built or modified for in-flight refueling; non- retractable (but removable) probe on starboard side of cockpit; combat radius increased to 648 nm(1,200kml 745miles). Avionics upgrades include Type 208B fire control radar, Type 563 INS, JD-3II Tacan, KJ-8602 radar warning receiver, RKL-800A ECM and HK-13E HUD; can carry up to 4 PL-8 AAMs. IN service with PLA AIr Force and Navy from 1996. Some or all now being upgraded to J-8H, possibly including more powerful SARI Kunlun turbojet. *J-8H: Further development of J-8D (preceding J-8F). Programme reportedly began 1995 and variant approved 1999. Retains twin pairs of wing fences and removable refuelling probe. WP-13B engines(said to be replaced by WP-14 Kunlun II in 2008); KLJ-1(Type 1471 KLJ-1) radar; PL-11 AAMs; possibly also YJ-91 anti- radiation ASMs. Flying control and avionics include HOTAS, INS/GPS and integrated ECM. Limited PLAAF service from 2002 including 21st division; maybe earmarked for upgrade to J-8F standards. Production completed, but being augmented by upgrading earlier J-8Ds and/or J-8Bs, there being redesignated J-8DH and J-8BH. *JZ-8 (J-8R): Reconnaissance version. Also Reported as J-8E, J-8R, and J-8V. believe to be converted from J-8A; at least 6 knowns. Retains gun armament; undernose sensor similar to package to that of Su-17/20/22 variants; centerline pod similar in appearance to that carried by Mig-21R, incorporating large rectangular camera window or SLAR antenna, in service with PLA Air Force. thumb|A Shenyang J-8F *JZ-8F: A reconnaissance version of the J-8F. existence confirmed in 2007; based on J-8F and replacing JZ-8/J-8R in PLAAF. Internal guns replaced by customised internal camera compartment with one small and one large window, indicating likelihood of separate optical and low-light or IR cameras for all weather day and night photography. Large (comms?) antenna just forward of tailfin; possibly WP-14 powerplant. *F-8IIM: Unveiled in Zhuhai Air Show 1996, export version of J-8B with Russian Phazotron Zhuk-8II PD radar (75 km range, and able to track up to ten airborne targets and attack two of them simultaneously), R-27R1 (AA-10) AAM and Kh-31P anti-radiation missile. The F-8IIM was to be powered by two, more powerful WP-13B turbojet engines. This aircraft is often mistakenly referred to as the \"J-8IIM\" with Kh-31A anti-ship missile (ASM) capability, but its radar lacked sea search mode for anti-shipping role. Additional proposed upgrade including No. 607 Institute Blue Sky Low-altitude navigation pod; Southwest China Electronic Equipment Research Institute KG-300G airborne self-protection jammer pod; No 613 Institute FLIR/Laser targeting pod; and a triple redundant flight by wire flight control system. The F-8IIM failed to attract any export customers and no domestic orders.China Air Force J8 – J8IIM Conversion from older airframe was reportedly much fewer than the 100 units of Zhuk-8II radar delivered, and the conversion might have only been an experimental programme with none entering service. : The F-8IIM fighter will probably be equipped with Russia's or China's helmet sight and advanced PL-9 and P-73 missiles. Phazotron, a Russian firm, has signed contracts with China to provide 150–200 improved Zhuk radars mainly in support of China's new F-8II fighter. *J-8IIG: Modified J-8II with tail hook and other improvements for developmental work on shipborne aircraft for carrier operations, such as in April 1987, evaluating & testing the Chinese reverse-engineered steam catapult from that of HMAS Melbourne (R21), which was finally confirmed 27 years later in April 2014 by CCTV-13. Both the take-off and landing were conducted on land with the reverse engineered steam catapult installed on the beach, and the test pilot was PLANAF pilot Li Guoqiang (李国强). Experience gained was applied to Shenyang J-15. *J-8IIM (2006): At Zhuhai Air Show 2006, a new variant \"J-8IIM\" was put on display with upgraded systems similar to the J-8H.Kanwa Daily News == Operators == ===People's Republic of China=== * People's Liberation Army Air Force: 24 J-8, 42 J-8A, 64 J-8B, 36 J-8D, 12 J-8E, 24 J-8F, 48 J-8H, 8 JZ-8, 24 JZ-8F in service in 2010 * People's Liberation Army Navy Air Force: 48 J-8I/J-8F/J-8B/J-8D in service in 2010 As of early 2011, there are about 300 Chinese J-8s in service.环球网. 中国空军做出艰难决定 开始退役歼8战机. 2011 == Specifications (F-8 IIM) == == See also == ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * * J-08, Shenyang Category:Shenyang aircraft Category:Twinjets Category:Mid-wing aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1969",
