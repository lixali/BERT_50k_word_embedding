Its capital was first Pyatigorsk, and later Vladikavkaz. After July 1918, it was part of the North Caucasian Soviet Republic. In contrast to other Soviet republics, the Republic was a coalition government.Alex Marshall: \"The Terek people's republic, 1918: coalition government in the Russian revolution\", Revolutionary Russia, 22:2, 2009, p. 203–221.
