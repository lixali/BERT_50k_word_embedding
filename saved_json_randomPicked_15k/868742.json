Having distinguished himself in helping to put down the rebellion which took place in Ulster in 1641, Chichester was admitted to the Privy Council of Ireland in 1643. It was on the advice of James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, that in 1647 he was created Earl of Donegall in the Peerage of Ireland. The earldom was created with a special remainder to the male heirs of his father, whom he succeeded a year later as 2nd Viscount Chichester and Governor of Carrickfergus for life. He took his seat in the Irish House of Lords in 1661. In 1668 he endowed a mathematical lectureship at Trinity College Dublin with an annuity of 30 livre (pounds), which lectureship survives as an annual public lecture at the School of Mathematics in Trinity College.Alumni Dublinenses : a register of the students, graduates, professors and provosts of Trinity College in the University of Dublin (1593–1860) Burtchaell, G.D./Sadlier, T.U. p149: Dublin, Alex Thom and Co, 1935 ==Marriages and children== He married three times: *Firstly to Dorcas Hill (1607–1630), a daughter of John Hill of Honiley, Warwickshire, (whose arms are shown on her monument in Eggesford Church: Sable, six talbot hounds argent, 3,2,1) by whom he had one daughter:Per inscription on her monument in Eggesford Church **Mary Chichester, wife of John St Leger and mother of Arthur St Leger, 1st Viscount Doneraile (died 1727). *Secondly to Lady Mary Digby (d. 1648), daughter of John Digby, 1st Earl of Bristol, (whose arms are shown on her monument in Eggesford Church: Azure, a fleur de lys argent) by whom he had eight children all of whom died young. *Thirdly in 1651 he married Letitia Hicks, daughter of Sir William Hicks, 1st Baronet, by whom he had surviving children one son and one daughter, four other daughters having died young: **William Chichester **Anne Chichester (died 1697) who married firstly John Butler, 1st Earl of Gowran and secondly Francis Aungier, 1st Earl of Longford. ==Death and burial== Lord Donegall died after a short illness in Belfast in 1675 and was buried in St Nicholas's Church, Carrickfergus. ==Succession== As all his sons had died young, the earldom passed under the remainder to his nephew Arthur Chichester. ==References== * Category:1606 births Category:1675 deaths Category:Members of the Privy Council of Ireland Chichester, Arthur Chichester, Arthur Category:People associated with Trinity College Dublin Arthur Category:People from County Antrim Category:Irish soldiers Category:Members of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Antrim constituencies 1 Category:Peers of Ireland created by Charles I",
