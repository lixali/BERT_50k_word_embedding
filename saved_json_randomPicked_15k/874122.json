 "text": "A condemned prisoner's last meal is a customary ritual preceding execution. In many countries, the prisoner may, within reason, select what the last meal will be. ==Contemporary restrictions in the United States== In the United States, most states give the meal a day or two before execution and use the euphemism \"special meal\". Alcohol or tobacco are usually, but not always, denied. Unorthodox or unavailable requests are replaced with similar substitutes. Some states place tight restrictions. In Florida, the food for the last meal must be purchased locally and the cost is limited to $40. In Oklahoma, cost is limited to $15. In Louisiana, the prison warden traditionally joins the condemned prisoner for the last meal. On one occasion, the warden paid for an inmate's lobster dinner. Sometimes, a prisoner asks to share the last meal with another inmate (as Francis Crowley did with John Resko) or has the meal distributed among other inmates (as requested by Raymond Fernandez). In September 2011, the state of Texas abolished all special last meal requests after condemned prisoner and white supremacist Lawrence Russell Brewer requested a large and expensive last meal, but did not eat any of it, stating that he was not hungry. The tradition of customized last meals is thought to have been established around 1924 in Texas. ==Documented last meal requests== This represents the items reported requested but does not, in all cases, represent what the prisoner actually received. ===Europe=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 100%\" !
