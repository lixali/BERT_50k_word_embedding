 "text": "Irish euro coins all share the same design by Jarlath Hayes, that of the harp, a traditional symbol for Ireland since the Middle Ages, based on that of the Brian Boru harp, housed in Trinity College Dublin. The same harp is used as on the official seals of the Taoiseach, and government ministers and the Seal of the President of Ireland. The coins' design also features the 12 stars of the EU, the year of issue and the Irish name for Ireland, \"Éire\", in a traditional Gaelic script. ==Irish euro design== All Irish euro coins bear the same design on their obverse side: a Celtic harp based on the Trinity College Harp, flanked to the left and right by the word \"ÉIRE\" (Irish for Ireland) and the year the coin was struck, written in Gaelic type. These in turn are surrounded by the 12 stars of the flag of Europe. On the one-euro coin the stars appear on the gold coloured surround with the harp and words in the silver coloured centre. The colours are in the reverse for the two euro coin. {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | width=150px | National Identifier | width=200px | \"ÉIRE\" (in Gaelic type) |- | Mint Mark | None |- | Engravers Initials | None |- | €2 Edge inscription | 200px |- |} ==Circulating mintage quantities== The following table shows the mintage quantity for all Irish euro coins, per denomination, per year. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;text-align:right\" !

The cost of producing a 1 cent coin is 1.65c and the cost of producing a 2 cent coin is 1.94c. Beginning on Wednesday 28 October 2015 Ireland followed The Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Hungary and, in introducing so-called Swedish rounding. While individual prices are still shown and summed up with 1-cent precision, the total sum is then rounded to the nearest 5 cents when paying with cash. Sums ending in 1, 2, 6 and 7 cents are rounded down; sums ending in 3, 4, 8 and 9 cents are rounded up. The 1 cent and 2 cent coins remain legal tender, and rounding is voluntary for both the customer and retailer, the Central Bank of Ireland advises \"for Rounding to happen, both the retailer and the customer must accept it; both will have the right to use exact change\". Rounding applies only to cash payments and does not apply to bills paid electronically - by debit card, credit card or by store card. ==See also== * Coins of the Republic of Ireland * Identifying marks on euro coins ==References== ==External links== * The Euro Information Website – Ireland * euroHOBBY Ireland Category:Euro coins by issuing country euro coins Category:Currencies of the Republic of Ireland euro coins Euro",
