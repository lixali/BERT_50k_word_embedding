Grossman, James R., Keating, Ann Durkin, and Reiff, Janice L., 2004 The Encyclopedia of Chicago. The University of Chicago Press, Founded by David Shepherd and Paul Sills, it is considered to be the first improvisational theater in the United States. ==History== ===Shepherd and Sills=== The Compass Players, founded by David Shepherd and Paul Sills, was the first Improvisational Theatre in America. It began July 8, 1955 as a storefront theater at 1152 E. 55th near the University of Chicago campus. They presented improvised plays. Shepherd, in Mark Siska's documentary Compass Cabaret ’55, about the birth of modern improvisation, stated his reasons for founding the Compass Players, “Theater in New York was very effete and based on three-act plays and based on verbiage and there was not much action,” he said. “I wanted to create a theater that would drag people off the street and seat them not in rows but at tables and give them something to drink, which was unheard of in [American] theater.” Previously, Shepherd founded and Sills Playwrights Theatre Club, along with Eugene Troobnick, and employed improvisational theater forms, named Theater Games, originally created and developed by Sills' mother, Viola Spolin. These same games were employed to develop material for the Compass Players. ===Evolution of Improvisation=== Initially, scenes were presented only once, but some of the players grew interested in polishing material into finished pieces. For example, Mike Nichols and Elaine May created many of their signature scenes in this manner. Shelley Berman also found that he could create solo routines by showing one half of telephone conversations.See Stephen Kercher's book \"Rebel With A Cause: Liberal Satire in Postwar America\", University of Chicago Press, 2006.

Flicker, Nichols and May, along with Del Close, codified a further set of principles to guide improvisational players. ==Legacy== Sills would co-found The Second City and Shepherd would return to New York City to create and produce a variety of improv forms including his Improvisation Olympics (ImprovOlympic). Nichols and May went on to New York, performing material largely derived from their Compass days. Close was featured in Flickers' Broadway musical comedy The Nervous Set, and afterwards developed his long-form improvisation the Harold. ==Notable alumni== *Alan Alda *Jane Alexander *Rose Arrick *Ed Asner *Sandy Baron *Shelley Berman *Roger Bowen *Del Close *Bob Coughlan *Severn Darden *Bob Dishy *Andrew Duncan *Theodore J.
