 "text": "Searchlight Pictures, Inc. is an American film studio that is a division of 20th Century Studios, a subsidiary of Walt Disney Studios, which is part of The Walt Disney Company. Founded in 1994 as Fox Searchlight Pictures, Inc. for 20th Century Studios (previously 20th Century Fox), the studio focuses primarily on producing, distributing and acquiring specialty films. Searchlight is best known for distributing the films Slumdog Millionaire, 12 Years a Slave, Birdman, The Shape of Water and Nomadland, all of which won an Academy Award for Best Picture. Other Best Picture nominations include The Full Monty, Sideways, Little Miss Sunshine, Juno, Black Swan, 127 Hours, The Tree of Life, The Descendants, Beasts of the Southern Wild, The Grand Budapest Hotel, Brooklyn, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, The Favourite, Jojo Rabbit, and Nightmare Alley. The studio has grossed over $5.3 billion worldwide and amassed 26 Golden Globe Awards, 48 BAFTA awards, and 44 Academy Awards. Slumdog Millionaire is the studio's largest commercial success, with over $377 million (US) of box office receipts, against a production budget of only $15 million. Searchlight Pictures was one of the 21st Century Fox film production companies that was acquired by Disney on March 20, 2019. The studio's current name was adopted on January 17, 2020. == History == thumb|200px|1997 logo used as Fox Searchlight Pictures. Prior to the creation of Searchlight, Twentieth Century Fox was active in the specialty film market, releasing independent and specialty films under the banner of 20th Century-Fox International Classics, later renamed 20th Century-Fox Specialized Film Division, then TLC Films. The most notable of the releases under these banners include Suspiria, Bill Cosby: Himself, Eating Raoul, The Gods Must Be Crazy, Reuben, Reuben, and Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. In the early 1990s, Twentieth Century Fox executives decided to emulate the commercial success of Disney's newly acquired Miramax studio. In 1994 Twentieth announced the formation of a subsidiary that would drive their entry into the specialty film market, and in July that year, they brought in Thomas Rothman, then president of production at The Samuel Goldwyn Company, to head up the new subsidiary. It was soon given the name Fox Searchlight Pictures, with Rothman as its founding president. The new company inherited the familiar branding elements associated with Twentieth Century Fox; Fox Searchlight films opened with a production logo consisting of the Fox Searchlight name presented as a large monolith, illuminated by the eponymous searchlights and accompanied by the Twentieth Century fanfare composed by Alfred Newman. From its first release, The Brothers McMullen (1995), Fox Searchlight went to distribute a series of independent films such as Girl 6, Stealing Beauty, and She's the One (all 1996). While critically well received, these early releases were not commercially very successful; Fox Searchlight's first real commercial breakthrough came with The Full Monty (1997), garnering the studio's first awards. In 2006, a companion label, Fox Atomic, was created to produce and/or distribute genre films. Fox Atomic closed down in 2009. The acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney took place on March 20, 2019, including Fox Searchlight. As of November 2019, FX and Fox Searchlight were assigned to supply Hulu with content. On January 17, 2020, it was announced that the \"Fox\" name would be dropped from several of the Fox assets that were acquired by Disney, shortening the company's name to \"Searchlight Pictures\", in order to avoid brand confusion with the Fox Corporation. More recently, Nancy Utley has officially left Searchlight Pictures after six months, to launch Lake Ellyn Entertainment, and struck a first look deal with Chernin Entertainment. == Film library == == Awards == Since 1994, Searchlight Pictures has accumulated 164 Academy Award nominations with 44 wins (including five Best Picture winners since 2009), 117 Golden Globe nominations with 26 wins, 173 BAFTA nominations with 48 wins, 66 Screen Actors Guild Award nominations with 12 wins, 215 Critics Choice Award nominations with 55 wins, and 137 Independent Spirit Awards nominations with 54 wins. == Searchlight Television == In April 2018, the studio launched Searchlight Television, broadening the variety of projects produced under the Searchlight banner. It is headed by David Greenbaum and Matthew Greenfield. Both original material and adaptations of Searchlight's existing film library will be produced for cable, streaming and broadcast television, in the form of documentaries, scripted series, limited series and more. In April 2019, the Hulu streaming service ordered The Dropout, starring Amanda Seyfried from Searchlight Television and 20th Television. The studio is also developing an adaptation of the City of Ghosts novel with ABC Signature and an adaptation of N. K. Jemisin's Inheritance Trilogy with Westbrook Studios. In October 2021, Hulu ordered a sequel series to the Mel Brooks film History of the World, Part I from Searchlight Television and 20th Television. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Title ! Genre !

The first two films to be acquired by the studio for this collection were Shelly Lauman's Birdie and Guy Nattiv's Skin, the latter of which won the 2018 Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film. Other acquisitions for the collection included A.V. Rockwell's Feathers, Matthew Puccini's Lavender, Freddy Macdonald's Sew Torn, Savanah Leaf and Taylor Russell's The Heart Still Hums and Julia Baylis and Sam Guest's Wiggle Room. == See also == * 20th Century Studios * Fox World (television production company) == References == Citations Sources * == External links == * Category:American companies established in 1994 Category:Film distributors of the United States Category:Film production companies of the United States Category:Entertainment companies based in California Category:Companies based in Los Angeles Category:Mass media companies established in 1994 Category:Entertainment companies established in 1994 Category:1994 establishments in California Category:American independent film studios Category:20th Century Studios Category:The Walt Disney Studios Category:Disney acquisitions Category:Disney production studios Category:Former News Corporation subsidiaries",
