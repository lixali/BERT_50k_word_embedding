At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Isodorus and Senator (or, less frequently, year 1189 Ab urbe condita). The denomination 436 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. == Events == === By place === ==== Europe ==== * Flavius Aetius, Roman general (magister militum), attempts to put an end to Burgundian raids in Gaul.
