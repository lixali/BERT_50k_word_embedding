 "text": "The X-Men are a team of superheroes appearing in American comic books published by the Marvel Comics. The X-Men first appeared in the self-titled X-Men comic, cover dated September 1963. Due to the X-Men's immense popularity, Marvel has launched dozens of spin-off series, called \"X-Legs\" throughout the years. Like Uncanny X-Men, most X-books feature mutants, humans born with extraordinary powers due to a genetic mutation. Some X-Books feature mutant superhero teams while others feature solo adventures of characters who became popular in Uncanny X-Men or another X-Book. Occasionally, X-Books use mutants as a metaphor for racial, religious and other minorities oppressed by society. For the purpose of this list, \"X-Men Comics\" will be defined by the following criteria: * The series was meant to continue indefinitely, was not a limited series. For limited series, see List of X-Men limited series. * The series featured mostly characters associated with and/or concepts originating in Uncanny X-Men or another X-Book, thus The Defenders and The Champions, which featured both X-Men-related and non-X-Men related characters will not be counted and neither will series which occasionally featured the X-Men characters, such as Marvel Comics Presents, Marvel Team-Up and What If?. __NOTOC__ ==A== *A+X (2012–2014), #1–18 *Adventures of the X-Men (1996–1997), #1–12 (all-new stories continuing the continuity of the Fox Network's X-Men
