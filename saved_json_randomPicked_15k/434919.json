Meale's website lists his previous occupations as author, editor, development officer, trade union official, researcher, political adviser and journalist. ==Parliamentary career== Meale entered Parliament on 11 June 1987 and made his maiden speech on 3 July 1987 in the Tourism debate where he commented on the poverty, lack of provision, opportunity and services in the Mansfield community. Meale was a whip from 1992 to 1994 when he became Parliamentary Private Secretary to John Prescott in Prescott's different portfolios until 1998. Meale served as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions under John Prescott from January 1998 to January 1999. He became a government whip Council of Europe Delegation in 2007 and acting Leader of the UK Delegation in 2010. He has been the chair of the British Section of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Cyprus Group since 2007. In 1998, Michael Ancram accused Meale of \"cronyism\" following allegations in The Sunday Times that he had lobbied on behalf of Anthony Kleanthous, the millionaire Greek-Cypriot chairman of Barnet football club. Kleanthous wanted to build a £14 million stadium on green belt land, 140 miles from Meale's constituency. The Sunday Times article said that Britain's Greek-Cypriot lobbying groups had paid for Meale and his wife to go to Cyprus and donated thousands of pounds to Labour. Meale denied cronyism, whilst Kleanthos insisted he had not donated to the Labour party and said it was \"a bit racist\" to link his business interests to Greek-Cypriot political lobbying efforts based on his ethnicity. Meale was Vice Chair of the APPG for Cyprus, and was regarded by Greek Cypriot groups as one of their \"oldest and closest friends in Parliament\". According to Meale, he first became interested in the political situation in Cyprus back in 1987 when Tony Benn advised him to \"pick a political issue and stick with it\". In the run-up to the UK referendum on membership of the European Union, Meale campaigned to remain in the EU. ===Expenses=== Meale was mentioned in the Parliamentary expenses scandal having claimed £13,000 over 4 years for gardening.
