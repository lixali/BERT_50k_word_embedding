 "text": "The grey shrikethrush or grey shrike-thrush (Colluricincla harmonica), formerly commonly known as grey thrush, is a songbird of Australasia. It is moderately common to common in most parts of Australia, but absent from the driest of the inland deserts. It is also found in New Guinea. ==Taxonomy and systematics== The grey shrikethrush was originally described in the genus Turdus. Alternate names include the brown shrike-thrush, buff-bellied shrike- thrush, grey shrike-flycatcher, northern shrike-thrush and south-western shrike-thrush. ===Subspecies=== Five subspecies are recognized: * C. h. brunnea - Gould, 1841: Originally described as a separate species. Found in northern Australia and Melville Island * C. h. superciliosa - Masters, 1876: Originally described as a separate species. Found in eastern New Guinea, islands in the Torres Strait and north-eastern Australia * C. h. harmonica - (Latham, 1801): Found in eastern Australia * C. h. strigata - Swainson, 1838: Originally described as a separate species. Found in Tasmania and the islands in the Bass Strait (Australia) * Western shrikethrush (C. h. rufiventris) - Gould, 1841: Originally described as a separate species. Found in western, southern and central Australia ==Description== Of medium size (about long) and lacking bright colours, the grey shrikethrush--usually just thrush in casual conversation--has an extraordinary gift for ringing melody, unmatched by any other Australasian species save perhaps the two lyrebirds and its northern relative, the sandstone shrikethrush. ==Status== The grey shrikethrush is evaluated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. ==Gallery== CSIRO ScienceImage 3102 Grey Shrikethrush.jpg|In Victoria Colluricincla harmonica -Tasmania-8.jpg|In Tasmania Grey Shrike-thrush.ogg|In Queensland Grey Shrike-thrush juvenile (Colluricincla harmonica) (15949091963).jpg|Juvenile Colluricincla harmonica Dorrigo NSW.jpg|Dorrigo, NSW, Australia == References == == External links == * BirdLife Species Factsheet grey shrikethrush Category:Birds of Australia Category:Birds of New Guinea grey shrikethrush Category:Articles containing video clips",
