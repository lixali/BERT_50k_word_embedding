 "text": "Northern Arizona University (NAU) is a public research university based in Flagstaff, Arizona. It was founded in 1899 as the final public university established in the Arizona Territory, 13 years before Arizona was admitted as the 48th state. It is a Hispanic-Serving Institution. A member of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, NAU is one of the three universities governed by the Arizona Board of Regents and accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. As of fall 2021, 28,718 students were enrolled at NAU with 21,248 at the Flagstaff campus. The university is divided into eight colleges offering about 130 undergraduate degrees, 100 graduate programs, and various academic certificates. Students can take classes and conduct research in Flagstaff, online, and at more than 20 statewide locations, including the Phoenix Biomedical Campus. The university is classified among \"R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity\" and ranked No. 191 in the National Science Foundation (NSF) national research rankings for fiscal year 2019. It is ranked No. 57 nationally among the most innovative schools in the 2021 U.S. News Best Colleges Ranking. NAU's astronomy faculty co-discovered several astronomical bodies, such as Eris, Sedna, and are major participants in the search for the hypothetical Planet Nine, with the university being a primary institution of the Lowell Observatory. The NAU Lumberjacks compete in the NCAA Division I, primarily as part of the Big Sky Conference, and have won several national championships, notably in cross country running. At an elevation of above sea level, the school's athletic facilities are used by Olympic and professional athletes worldwide for prestige high altitude training. ==History== Initially named the Northern Arizona Normal School, the institution opened on September 11, 1899, with 23 students, two faculty members—one, Almon Nicholas Taylor, who was also the school president—and \"two copies of Webster's International Dictionary bound in sheepskin\" as teaching resources.\"About NAU.\" History. Northern Arizona University, December 22, 2016. The first graduating class, in 1901, consisted of four women who received credentials to teach in the Arizona Territory. In 1925, the Arizona State Legislature allowed the school, which was then called the Northern Arizona State Teachers College (ASTC), to grant bachelor of education degrees. In 1929, the school became Arizona State Teachers College at Flagstaff.thumb|250px|The Teacher Training School (now Blome Building) in 1922Also in 1929, the Great Depression struck the nation, and the ASTC found new meaning in community outreach. Rather than collapsing, the school endured through the depression. In fact, Grady Gammage, the school president at the time, described higher education as \"a 'depression industry' that fared well in hard times.\" Despite financial difficulties, enrollment increased from 321 students to 535 students between 1930 and 1940, and graduate work was introduced in 1937.Underhill, Karen J. \"I REMEMBER Depression-Era Students at Arizona State Teacher's College.\" I Remember. Arizona Board of Regents, 1996. Web. May 16, 2016. ASTC provided an education during economically trying times, often creating jobs to help students afford their education; they worked in the school-owned dairy farm, in the campus kitchen and dining hall, and as newspaper deliverers. The self-sufficiency of the college helped conserve monetary resources, and it was a major contributor to the local economy of the surrounding Flagstaff community, injecting almost a half- million dollars in 1938.NAU – History. Arizona Board of Regents, May 16, 2016. ASTC was known for its diverse student body and ethnic tolerance. In fact, the first Hopi to receive a college degree was Ida Mae Fredericks in 1939. Students came from rural farms, mining families, the East Coast, and points between. During the depression, fraternities and clubs sprang up, reflecting the diversity of backgrounds and interests. Enrollment dropped sharply at the beginning of World War II, dropping to 161 in 1945.\"About NAU.\" History. Northern Arizona University, 2016. Web. May 16, 2016. During this time, ASTC became a Navy V-12 program training site. However, the end of World War II brought increased enrollment as returning veterans continued their education. The end of the war also expanded programs beyond teaching degrees, especially in the fields of art and science. To reflect this growth, the school changed its name to Arizona State College at Flagstaff in 1945 and, in 1958, became Arizona State College. Also in 1958, the world-renowned forestry program was started. With further growth over the next two decades, the Arizona Board of Regents granted Arizona State College university status as Northern Arizona University in 1966. thumb|The Old Main on the south campus ==Campuses== ===Flagstaff campus=== Set across 829 forested acres, the Flagstaff campus houses academic, administrative, and residential buildings. thumb|250x250px|A bird's-eye view of the NAU Science and Health building At above sea level, NAU is one of the highest-elevation four-year college campuses in the country. The main campus is surrounded by the largest contiguous ponderosa pine forest in the world and enjoys a four-season climate, with an average annual snowfall of 260 inches. Winter skiing is accessible at Arizona Snowbowl, an alpine ski resort located on the San Francisco Peaks, northwest of town, and the Grand Canyon and Sedona are short drives away. Flagstaff is regularly ranked among the best college towns in the United States. For many years, the university has prioritized sustainability initiatives, and campus-wide programs and resources encourage the entire university community to get involved with sustainability efforts. There are more than a dozen LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design)-certified buildings on campus and all new construction must meet strict LEED standards. Dining services and facilities contribute to a composting initiative, collecting more than 300,000 pounds of material each year, which prevents 250 metric tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. Much of the campus uses renewable wind and solar technologies and the university is investigating opportunities to utilize the vast ponderosa pine forests around campus for biomass electricity or heat production. ===Statewide campuses and NAU Online=== In addition to the more than 21,000 students who study on the Flagstaff campus, NAU currently serves another 8,000 students online and statewide. In order to provide access and affordability to all Arizona residents, NAU offers more than 130 accredited degree programs at more than 20 statewide locations. NAU also has partnerships with community colleges and NAU–Yavapai, a collaboration with Yavapai College in Prescott Valley, Arizona. The university's oldest branch campus, and the largest, is NAU–Yuma.
