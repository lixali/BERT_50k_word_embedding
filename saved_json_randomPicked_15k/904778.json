The Rasmus Midgett House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. ==Boundaries== The northern border of Waves is generally considered to be the ditch that runs under Highway 12 just south of Resort Rodanthe Drive. The southern border, separating Waves and Salvo, is more ambiguous. Long-time residents indicate various \"official lines\" separating the two. Formerly Rodanthe, Waves and Salvo were each served by their own post office. Today a single post office, located in Waves, serves the entire community and the former lines that separated the communities have become blurred. thumb|right|The beach at Waves ==Economy== The Waves area is dominated by campgrounds both large and small as well as numerous rental houses. ==Climate== According to the Trewartha climate classification system, Waves, North Carolina has a humid subtropical climate with hot and humid summers, cool winters and year-around precipitation (Cfak).
