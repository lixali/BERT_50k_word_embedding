 "text": "The Iberian grey shrike (Lanius meridionalis) is a member of the shrike family. It is closely related to the great grey shrike, Lanius excubitor, and its plumage is generally similar to the great grey shrike apart from the differences noted below. The Iberian was previously considered conspecific with the great grey; where they co-occur, they do not interbreed and are separated by choice of habitat.Sangster, George; Knox, Alan G.; Helbig, Andreas J. & Parkin, David T. (2002): Taxonomic recommendations for European birds. Ibis 144(1): 153–159. PDF fulltext ==Taxonomy and systematics== The genus name, Lanius, is derived from the Latin word for \"butcher\", and some shrikes are also known as \"butcher birds\" because of their feeding habits. The specific meridionalis is Latin for \"southern\". The common English name \"shrike\" is from Old English scríc, \"shriek\", referring to the shrill call. It is resident in southern Europe. It is slightly smaller and darker than the great grey shrike, and prefers dry open country. ==Behaviour and ecology== This medium-sized passerine bird eats large insects, small birds and rodents. Like other shrikes it hunts from prominent perches, and impales corpses on thorns or barbed wire as a \"larder\". ==References== ==Bibliography== ===Identification=== * Jorma Tenovuo & Juha Varrela (1998) Identification of the Great Grey Shrike complex in Europe Alula 4(1): 4 - 11 *Clement, Peter, and Tim Worfolk (1995) Southern and eastern Great Grey Shrikes in northwest Europe Birding World 8(8) 300-309 ==External links== *Ageing and sexing (PDF; 4.7 MB) by Javier Blasco-Zumeta & Gerd-Michael Heinze * * Iberian grey shrike Category:Birds of Southern Europe Iberian grey shrike",
