One of the great characters of eighteenth-century Cambridge, he built a \"water-work\" in his garden and paddled round it on a water-cycle. He also constructed a \"zodiack\", now considered to be the first planetarium, a hollow sphere that could hold thirty people showing the movements of the planets and constellations which remained in the grounds of Pembroke until 1871. ==References== Category:1680 births Category:1770 deaths Category:People from Breckland District Category:18th-century British astronomers Category:People educated at Norwich School Category:Alumni of Pembroke College, Cambridge Category:Masters of Pembroke College, Cambridge Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Lowndean Professors of Astronomy and Geometry Category:Vice-Chancellors of the University of Cambridge",
