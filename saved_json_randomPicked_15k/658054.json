 "text": "Saugatuck Dunes State Park is a public recreation area covering on the shore of Lake Michigan between Saugatuck and Holland in Allegan County, Michigan. ==History== The site was once part of the estate of inventor Dorr E. Felt, whose summer home, the Felt Mansion, is an in-holding within the state park that is undergoing restoration. Built by the inventor of the comptometer in 1928, the Felt's summer home was sold to the St. Augustine Seminary in 1949 and used as housing for young students, and later on, for cloistered nuns. In the 1970s, the building was purchased by the state of Michigan and used as a state police post, with nearby buildings serving as a prison. The state completed purchasing the site for state park purposes in 1978. ==Activities and amenities== The largely undeveloped state park features of hiking trails, sand dunes covered with trees and grass, and of beachfront located two-thirds of a mile from the picnic parking area. ==References== ==External links== *Saugatuck Dunes State Park Michigan Department of Natural Resources *Saugatuck Dunes State Park Map Michigan Department of Natural Resources Category:State parks of Michigan Category:Protected areas of Allegan County, Michigan Category:Protected areas established in 1977 Category:1977 establishments in Michigan Category:Beaches of Michigan Category:Dunes of Michigan Category:Landforms of Allegan County, Michigan Category:IUCN Category III",
