 "text": "Left Turn was a bimonthly activist news magazine that focused on international social justice movements. Based in New York City and produced by an all volunteer editorial collective, the magazine promoted anti-imperialism and anti-authoritarianism. Left Turn had its roots in the anti-capitalist wing of the Global Justice Movement and was founded in the wake of the anti-WTO protests in Seattle in 1999 by a small group of socialists. The magazine's tagline, \"Notes from the Global Intifada\", was inspired by the then ongoing Palestinian intifada. The magazine supported grassroots activists with the Palestine Solidarity Movement. The magazine ceased print publication after the August 2011 issue, but continues to operate a website. . ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Anti-capitalism Category:Anti- imperialism in North America Category:Bimonthly magazines published in the United States Category:Criticism of neoconservatism Category:Defunct political magazines published in the United States Category:Magazines established in 1999 Category:Magazines disestablished in 2011 Category:Magazines published in New York City Category:News magazines published in the United States Category:1999 establishments in New York City",
