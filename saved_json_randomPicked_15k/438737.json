 "text": "The United States Constitution names the president of the United States the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. Many presidents, however, also served in the military before taking office; all but 13 of the 45 persons to become president have served. Of the 32 presidents with military service, 31 have been commissioned officers, of whom five began their careers as regular officers (Jimmy Carter transferred to the Naval Reserve after five years in the Navy). There have been 13 presidents who held general officer rank (four regular officers, six militia officers, three volunteers). __TOC__ ==Table of United States presidents by military rank== ===General of the Armies=== {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\" |-style=\"vertical- align:middle;\" ! width=\"4%\" | Rank order ! width=\"13%\" | Highest rank ! width=\"12%\" | Branch ! width=\"18%\" | President ! width=\"20%\" | Combat experience ! width=\"31%\" | Service notes |- ! 1 | General of the Armies of the United States | center|50pxContinental Army/United States Army Virginia militia | center|125pxGeorge Washington wikisource:Public Law 94-479wikisource:Order 31-3 Department of the Army Order Number 31-3 of 13 March 1978 | French and Indian War (1754-1758) Revolutionary War (1775-1783) Whiskey Rebellion (1791-1794) |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Served in the Virginia militia (1752–1758), attaining the rank of colonel; served as commander in chief of the Continental Army (1775–1783) during the Revolutionary War, with the rank of \"General and Commander in Chief.\" Washington was a lieutenant general in the United States Army at his death. In 1976, as part of the Bicentennial, then-president Gerald R. Ford posthumously appointed Washington as General of the Armies of the United States and specified that he would forever rank above all officers of the Army, past, present and future. The rank of General of the Armies is considered senior to General of the Army, and has been bestowed on only two officers in history, John J. Pershing, in 1919 for his services in World War I, and George Washington for his service as the first Commanding General of the United States Army. (An equivalent rank, Admiral of the Navy, was given to George Dewey.) |} ===General of the Army=== {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\" |-style=\"vertical-align:middle;\" ! width=\"4%\" | Rank order ! width=\"13%\" | Highest rank ! width=\"12%\" | Branch ! width=\"18%\" | President ! width=\"20%\" | Combat experience ! width=\"31%\" | Service notes |- ! 2 | center|100px General of the Army | center|50pxUnited States Army (Regular army) | center|125pxDwight D.
