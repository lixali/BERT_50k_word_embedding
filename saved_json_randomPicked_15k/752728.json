 "text": "Document is the fifth studio album by American rock band R.E.M., released on August 31, 1987, by I.R.S. Records. It was the first album by the band to be produced by Scott Litt. ==Composition== Document was R.E.M.'s first album to be co-produced both by the band and Scott Litt; this was a collaboration that continued through the productions of Green, Out of Time, Automatic for the People, Monster, and New Adventures in Hi-Fi. The album's clear production and muscular rock riffs both helped to move the band toward mainstream success and built on the work done by Don Gehman, who had produced their previous album Lifes Rich Pageant. This release not only launched \"The One I Love\" — R.E.M.'s first Top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 9 — but also gave them their first platinum album. The opening track \"Finest Worksong\" is powered by a one-string strum from Peter Buck throughout the song and talks about reform and revolutionary action. \"Exhuming McCarthy\" makes an explicit parallel between the red-baiting of Joe McCarthy's time and the strengthening of the sense of American exceptionalism during the Reagan era, especially the Iran- Contra affair. Starting with the click-clack of a typewriter, it also includes a sound clip of Joseph Welch's rebuke of McCarthy from the Army-McCarthy Hearings: \"Let us not assassinate this lad further, Senator ... You've done enough. Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?\" \"Strange\" was originally recorded by post-punk band Wire on their debut album Pink Flag. R.E.M.'s version of this song has slightly- altered lyrics—where the line \"Joey's nervous\" was changed to \"Michael's nervous\" in the first verse—and has a considerably faster tempo. R.E.M. expanded their instrumentation somewhat on the album, adding a dulcimer to \"King of Birds\" and a saxophone to \"Fireplace\". Steve Berlin was brought in to add his saxophone skills because of a prior relationship with producer Scott Litt. This experimentation would lead to their adoption of the mandolin, which featured prominently on their subsequent albums Green and Out of Time; furthermore, the band's musicians began swapping instruments both in concert and the studio with an effort to create new sounds and avoid stagnation. ==Packaging== The original sleeve for the album featured the message \"File under Fire\", a reference to what Michael Stipe considered to be the central lyrical theme of the album, and also references the chorus to \"The One I Love\". A similar message (\"File under water\") could be found on the cover of the band's second album, Reckoning, as well as on the compilation album Eponymous (\"File under grain\") referring to the idea behind \"Talk About the Passion\", which was about hunger. Two rejected suggestions for the title of the album—R.E.M. No. 5 and Table of Content—also appear on the sleeve artwork.R.E.M. in Time: The Story Behind Every Song, Craig Rosen, 1997 Other possible album titles included Mr. Evil Breakfast, Skin Up with R.E.M., and Last Train to Disneyland (the last one having been suggested by Peter Buck, who felt that America under the presidency of Ronald Reagan was beginning to feel a lot like the famed amusement park).Reveal: The Story of R.E.M., Johnny Black, 2004 ==Critical reception== In a contemporary review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau said the band had moved on from their past work's escapism and that \"their discovery of the outside world has sharpened their sense of humor along with everything else\", citing \"It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)\" as an \"inspirational title\". Rolling Stone reviewer David Fricke felt that the album was R.E.M.'s \"finest to date\", and said that \"Document is the sound of R.E.M. on the move\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that \"where Lifes Rich Pageant sounded a bit like a party record, Document is a fiery statement, and its memorable melodies and riffs are made all the more indelible by its righteous anger.\" Rolling Stone went on to include the album in their list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s (in 41st place), and then ranked it number 462 on 2012 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2012, Slant Magazine listed the album at number 17 on its list of \"Best Albums of the 1980s\". ==Reissue== In 1999, the album was remastered by Bob Ludwig and re-released on Compact Disc by I.R.S. Records in the United States. This version came in a replica of the record sleeve made of cardboard. In 2005, Capitol Records (whose then parent company EMI at that time owned I.R.S. Records' catalog) issued an expanded DualDisc edition of Document which includes a digitally remastered version of the album on the CD side, a DVD-Audio, DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1-channel surround sound mix of the album done by Elliot Scheiner on the DVD side, and the original CD booklet. ==Track listing== All songs were written by Bill Berry, Peter Buck, Mike Mills and Michael Stipe, except where noted.
