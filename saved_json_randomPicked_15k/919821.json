 "text": "The 1963 NHL Amateur Draft was the first NHL Entry Draft. It was a draft to assign unaffilated amateur junior-age players to NHL teams. It was held on June 5 at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, Quebec. It was the first amateur draft, which consisted of 16-year-old players. The amateur draft was instituted by NHL President Clarence Campbell as a means of phasing out the sponsorship of amateur teams by the league's member clubs. The NHL wanted to create what Campbell called \"a uniform opportunity for each team to acquire a star player\". Prior to the creation of the draft NHL teams would sponsor amateur teams and players, pre-empting other NHL clubs from acquiring new, young talent, and limiting amateur players' prospects in the NHL to the team which sponsored them. Eligibility in this draft was limited to all amateur players who would reach 17 years of age between August 1, 1963, and July 31, 1964. Under the league rules, teams were not allowed to talk to the drafted players about turning professional until they turned 18. At that point, the teams had 72 hours to get the players signed or placed on their negotiation list. Players already on sponsorship lists were ineligible. The draft order was determined by giving the teams choice of their place in the six-team order based on a reverse order of the standings, for example, as the Boston Bruins finished last in the 1962–63 season they were given first choice of pick in the order. The final draft order was chosen to be Montreal Canadiens, Detroit Red Wings, Boston Bruins, New York Rangers, Chicago Black Hawks and Toronto Maple Leafs. The order would rotate in the next draft such that each team moved up one spot in the order, and the first pick Canadiens would move to sixth. This first draft consisted of four rounds, however few top prospects were available to the draft in the early years as most of hockey's top junior players had already been assigned to NHL clubs through sponsored junior teams. In the 1963 draft only 21 players, out of a possible 24 picks, were chosen. This is because teams were allowed to defer their pick to the next team in the draft order. The Red Wings chose not to exercise their third and fourth round picks, and the Black Hawks elected not to exercise their fourth round pick. Of the players selected five eventually played in the NHL, and only one won the Stanley Cup (Peter Mahovlich). None of the players selected have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. ==Selections by round== Below are listed the selections in the 1963 NHL amateur draft. {| |- |style=\"background- color:#FFCC00; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:2em;\"| |= NHL All-StarPlayers are identified as an All-Star if they were selected for the All-Star game at any time in their career.|| |style=\"background-color:#CCFFCC; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:2em;\"| |= Hall of famers |} ===Round one=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 100%\" |- !style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" width=5%|Pick # !! style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" width=20%|Player !! style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" width=10%|Position!! style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" width=15%|Nationality !! style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" width=21%|NHL team !! style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" width=29%|College/junior/club team |- |align=center| 1 || Garry Monahan || Centre || || Montreal Canadiens || St. Michael's Buzzers (MetJHL) |- |align=center| 2 || bgcolor=\"#FFCC00\"| Peter Mahovlich || Right wing || || Detroit Red Wings|| St. Michael's Buzzers (MetJHL) |- |align=center| 3 || Orest Romashyna || Left wing || || Boston Bruins || New Hamburg Firebirds (CJCHL) |- |align=center| 4 || Al Osborne || Right wing || || New York Rangers || Weston Dodgers (MetJHL) |- |align=center| 5 || Art Hampson || Defence || || Chicago Black Hawks || Trenton Midgets (OAAAMHL) |- |align=center| 6 || Walt McKechnie || Centre || || Toronto Maple Leafs || London Nationals (WJBHL) |- |align=center colspan=\"6\" bgcolor=\"#efefef\"| |} ===Round two=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 100%\" |- !style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" width=5%|Pick # !! style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" width=20%|Player !! style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" width=10%|Position!! style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" width=15%|Nationality !! style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" width=21%|NHL team !! style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" width=29%|College/junior/club team |- |align=center| 7 || Rodney Presswood || Defence || || Montreal Canadiens || Georgetown Midgets (OAAAMHL) |- |align=center| 8 || Bill Cosburn || Centre || || Detroit Red Wings || Bick's Pickles Midgets (OAAAMHL) |- |align=center| 9 || Terrance Lane || Centre || || Boston Bruins || Georgetown Midgets (OAAAMHL) |- |align=center| 10 || Terry Jones || Centre || || New York Rangers || Weston Midgets (OAAAMHL) |- |align=center| 11 || Wayne Davison || Defence || || Chicago Black Hawks || Georgetown Midgets (OAAAMHL) |- |align=center| 12 || Neil Clairmont || Left wing|| || Toronto Maple Leafs || Parry Sound Midgets (OAAAMHL) |- |align=center colspan=\"6\" bgcolor=\"#efefef\"| |} ===Round three=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 100%\" |- !style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" width=5%|Pick # !! style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" width=20%|Player !! style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" width=10%|Position!! style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" width=15%|Nationality !! style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" width=21%|NHL team !! style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" width=29%|College/junior/club team |- |align=center| 13 || Roy Pugh || Centre || || Montreal Canadiens || Aurora Bears (SOJCHL) |- |align=center| 14 || Roger Bamburak || Right wing || || Boston Bruins || Isaac Brock Secondary School (HS-Manitoba) |- |align=center| 15 || Mike Cummings || Forward || || New York Rangers || Georgetown Midgets (OAAAMHL) |- |align=center| 16 || Bill Carson || Defence || || Chicago Black Hawks || Brampton Midgets (OAAAMHL) |- |align=center| 17 || bgcolor=\"#FFCC00\"| Jim McKenny || Defence || || Toronto Maple Leafs || Toronto Neil McNeil Maroons (MetJHL) |- |align=center colspan=\"6\" bgcolor=\"#efefef\"| |} ===Round four=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 100%\" |- !style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" width=5%|Pick # !! style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" width=20%|Player !! style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" width=10%|Position!! style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" width=15%|Nationality !! style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" width=21%|NHL team !! style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" width=29%|College/junior/club team |- |align=center| 18 || Glen Shirton || Defence || || Montreal Canadiens || Port Colborne Midgets (OAAAMHL) |- |align=center| 19 || Jim Blair || Forward || || Boston Bruins || Georgetown Midgets (OAAAMHL) |- |align=center| 20 || Cam Allison || Defence || || New York Rangers || Portage la Prairie Terriers (CMJHL) |- |align=center| 21 || Gerry Meehan || Centre || || Toronto Maple Leafs || Toronto Neil McNeil Maroons (MetJHL) |- |align=center colspan=\"6\" bgcolor=\"#efefef\"| |} {| |- |style=\"background-color:#FFCC00; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:2em;\"| |= NHL All-Star || |style=\"background-color:#CCFFCC; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:2em;\"| |= Hall of famers |} ==See also== * 1963–64 NHL season * List of NHL players ==References== * ==External links== * Facts about the 1963 draft on hockeydraftcentral.com * 1963 NHL Amateur Draft player stats at The Internet Hockey Database Draft Category:National Hockey League Entry Draft",
