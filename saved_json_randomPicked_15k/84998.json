The bridge had a double span, wooden, double Burr arch trusses design. It was painted red on the outside, the traditional color of Lancaster County covered bridges. Both approaches to the bridge were painted in the traditional white color. The bridge's WGCB Number is 38-36-21. In 1980 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places as structure number 80003537. It was located at (40.00983, -76.16217), in Paradise Township on Ronks Road 0.4 km (0.25 mi) south of U.S. Route 30 to the east of Lancaster city. == History == Herr's Mill Covered Bridge was built in 1844 by Joseph Elliot and Robert Russell at a cost of $1787. It has a double-span, double- arch Burr arch truss construction. In 1875, the bridge was rebuilt by James C. Carpenter at a cost of $1860. The bridge was later bypassed by a new concrete bridge and is now on the private property of the Mill Bridge Village Camping Resort. Owner Brian Kopan was quoted as saying \"The bridge is in fine condition. Weâ€™re hoping to keep it as it is.\" In October 2018, the bridge was dismantled and was being moved to Elizabethtown, before it fell into the creek. == Dimensions == *Length: 178 feet (54.3 m) total lengthNote: Two independent sources disagree on this length. In other covered bridges, the McCain source agreed more closely with official government sources while the Bickel source seemed incorrect or perhaps just measuring a different length. In this case, the Bickel source states that the bridge length is 113 feet (34.4 m). *Width: 15 feet (4.6 m) total width == Gallery == Image:Herr's Mill Covered Bridge Wide View 3000px.jpg|The side of the bridge showing part of the main road to the left and Herr's Mill to the right Image:Herr's Mill Covered Bridge Side View 2696px.jpg|Another picture of the same side Image:Herr's Mill Covered Bridge Back Side View 3000px.jpg|The other side of the bridge Image:Herr's Mill Covered Bridge Alternate Front and Side 3008px.jpg Image:Herr's Mill Covered Bridge Side and Front 3264px.jpg Image:Herr's Mill Covered Bridge and Buggy 2600px.jpg|A horse and buggy going past the bridge ==See also== *Burr arch truss *List of Lancaster County covered bridges == References == Category:Covered bridges in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania Category:Covered bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania Category:Bridges completed in 1844 Category:Road bridges in Pennsylvania Category:National Register of Historic Places in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania Category:Road bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania Category:Wooden bridges in Pennsylvania Category:Burr Truss bridges in the United States",
