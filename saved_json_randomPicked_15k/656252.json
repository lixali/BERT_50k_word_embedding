First called \"Mud Lake\", because of its location on the shores of what is now known as Jewell Lake, a post office named Mud Lake was established on March 10, 1887, with George W. LaChapelle as postmaster. In 1912, two surveyors staying at the home of resident Frank Barton, laid out a town around the lake, sold lots, and named the town for Barton. The name of the post office was changed to Barton City on April 1, 1912. Barton City hosts an annual Labor Day Baseball Tournament every year, bringing in teams from all over the state of Michigan. The tournament helps raise money for MDA.

The city also puts on a fireworks show on the evening of July 4 every year. == References == == External links == * Clarke Historical Library, Central Michigan University, Bibliography on Alcona County Category:Unincorporated communities in Alcona County, Michigan Category:Populated places established in 1887 Category:Unincorporated communities in Michigan",
