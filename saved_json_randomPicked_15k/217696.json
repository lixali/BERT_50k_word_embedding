He earned the Distinguished Flying Medal for his role in the Battle of Heligoland Bight and was a director of London United Investments.

Driver was also considered to play Rose DeWitt Butaker in the 1997 film Titanic, but director James Cameron felt she was too old so Kate Winslet was cast instead. In 1998, Driver starred in Sandra Goldbacher's film The Governess. That year, she co-starred opposite Christian Slater and Morgan Freeman in the action thriller Hard Rain. Driver has also worked on several animated features, voicing Jane in Disney's 1999 version of Tarzan and Lady Eboshi in the 1999 English-dubbed release of the Japanese film Princess Mononoke.
