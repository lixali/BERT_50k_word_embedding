 "text": "Perrey and Kingsley (known also as \"Perrey & Kingsley\") was an electronic music duo made up of French composer Jean-Jacques Perrey and German-American composer Gershon Kingsley. The duo lasted from 1965 to 1967. == History == === The In Sound From Way Out! === Kingsley was a German-American arranger of Broadway musicals, and Perrey was a French accordion player and medical student who abandoned his studies after meeting Georges Jenny, the inventor of the Ondioline that hired Perrey as a salesman of the instrument. Perrey and Kingsley met in 1964 at Caroll Bratman's residence and in that same year they began their first project entitled The In Sound From Way Out!. During the 1960s, Perrey experimented with tape loops, a technique known as Musique concrete, which is generally attributed to the French Pierre Schaeffer. Since this was decades before the advent of digital technology, each tune took weeks of painstaking editing and splicing to produce, in addition his first composition for Vanguard label was \"The Little Man From Mars\". Later the first Perrey and Kingsley album titled The In Sound From Way Out! was released in 1966, and its cover was made by Jules Halfant. In that same year they made a performance on the American game show \"I've Got a Secret\", in which Perrey imitated four orchestral instruments with the Ondioline, and then played with Kingsley one of the songs recently released from album of that same year (Spooks In Space, an electronic version of the Saint-Saëns's Danse macabre). \"Swan's Splashdown\" is a Danse des petits cygnes version from Pyotr Tchaikovsky's \"Swan Lake\" ballet and \"Countdown At 6\" is a version of the Dance of the Hours by Ponchielli. The final track on the album, \"Visa To The Stars\" is co-credited to Andy Badale. Unlike the rest of the album, this track is has a more serious tone and lacks the unusual sound effects of the other eleven cuts. It is highly reminiscent of the style of Joe Meek and his hit \"Telstar\" by The Tornados. Also was the background theme of a commercial for the Esso oil company. === Kaleidoscopic Vibrations === For the second studio album \"Kaleidoscopic Vibrations\", Perrey and Kingsley they incorporated the Moog synthesizer, «a huge and complicated electronic instrument that resembles an old style telephone switchboard.» The Perrey's tape loops, and the effects were aggregates in post-production after Kingsley's performances. In 1967 was finally released the second and ultimate studio album of the duet Perrey and Kingsley, \"Kaleidoscopic Vibrations\" is one of the first albums to use the synthesizer by Robert Moog. and some of the early Moog synthesizer tracks are \"The Savers\" and \"Pioneers Of The Stars\", two tracks that were released in December 1967 in a Double single, on the other hand, the instrument they bought is the second Moog modular ever sold. The album is a mix between original tracks by Perrey and Kingsley like \"The Savers\" or \"Fallout\" and synthesized interpretations of Winchester Cathedral, Moon River, Mas Que Nada and other songs from time. One of the original tracks, \"Piooners of the Stars\" written by Badale had an very old version that was included in the 2017 compilation album titled \"Jean-Jacques Perrey et son Ondioline\". After the release of \"Kaleidoscopic Vibrations\", the duet disbanded, and Jean-Jacques Perrey recorded other two studio albums with the Vanguard Records label: \"The Amazing New Electronic Pop Sound of Jean Jacques Perrey\" (1968) and \"Moog Indigo\" (1970). On the other hand Gershon Kingsley released in 1969 the album \"Music to Moog By\", which included the original version of Popcorn, that would later reach a great popularity with the version of Hot Butter. == Discography == === Studio albums === *1966: The In Sound from Way Out!
