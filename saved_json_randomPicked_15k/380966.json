 "text": "John Barlow was a member of Henry VIII's Protestant Church as Dean of Worcester Cathedral. During the king's search for an annulment to his first marriage, Barlow acted as a courier between England and Italy, while Rector of Hever. ==Life== He graduated M.A. at the University of Oxford in 1521. Barlow was intimately involved in the King's attempts to secure a divorce from his first wife, Katherine of Aragon from the Pope. Barlow was a supporter of Henry's fianc√©e, Anne Boleyn. Barlow uncovered evidence of Cardinal Wolsey's betrayal of the King's cause in Rome, which he faithfully reported to a horrified Anne in 1528. This information helped solidify the future queen's hatred towards Wolsey, something which played a major part in the Cardinal's fall from power the following year.

His closeness to Anne Boleyn led some to suggest he must have known of her 'treason.'p.305, Eric Ives, Anne Boleyn One unfortunate Welsh vicar who suggested this was hounded by Barlow who was intolerant and confrontational.'Tim Treml, John Barlow, the Red-haired Dean Barlow was Dean of Worcester from 1544 until he was deprived of the role under Queen Mary in 1553.B.
