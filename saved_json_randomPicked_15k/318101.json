 "text": "Jorge Antonio Bell Mathey (born October 21, 1959), better known as George Bell, is a Dominican former left fielder and American League MVP in Major League Baseball who played 12 seasons for the Toronto Blue Jays (1981, 1983–1990), Chicago Cubs (1991) and Chicago White Sox (1992–1993). Bell batted and threw right-handed. ==Career== Originally signed by the Philadelphia Phillies in 1978, Bell was selected by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 1980 Rule 5 draft.George Bell Statistics and History Baseball-Reference.com. Retrieved January 19, 2013. Bell was discovered in the Dominican Republic by Blue Jays scout Epy Guerrero. His first season as a regular was in , when he first teamed with fellow outfielders Lloyd Moseby and Jesse Barfield. That outfield, along with solid starting pitching, led the Blue Jays to their first-ever American League East division title in . Bell caught a fly ball, off the bat of Ron Hassey, for the final out in the 5–1 victory over the New York Yankees on October 5, clinching the division title for the Blue Jays. Despite Bell's .321 average in the ALCS, they lost the series to the Kansas City Royals. His best season came in , although the Blue Jays fell two games short of the Detroit Tigers in the division race. Bell finished with a .308 batting average, .352 on-base percentage, .608 slugging percentage, 111 runs, 47 home runs and a league-leading 134 runs batted in. He was awarded the American League MVP award that year. On April 4, , Bell became the first player in Major League history to hit three home runs on an opening day (all of them coming off of Bret Saberhagen), however, his play throughout the year declined as he conflicted with Blue Jays manager Jimy Williams, who wanted Bell to become the Jays' full-time designated hitter. Bell had a bounce-back year in , posting a .297 average, 18 home runs and 104 RBI, helping the Blue Jays win their second division title. However, in the ALCS, he only hit .200 with one home run, as they lost the series to the Oakland Athletics. Bell became a free agent after the season and signed with the Chicago Cubs. After one year with the Cubs, he was traded across town to the Chicago White Sox for Sammy Sosa and Ken Patterson. He played two years with the White Sox, recording 25 home runs and 112 RBI in . In his play declined, primarily due to a persistent knee injury. He was benched in the ALCS against his former team, the Blue Jays, and was released at the end of the season, after which he announced his retirement. Bell was a powerful free-swinger, usually posting a good slugging percentage and relatively low strikeout rate, but a poor on-base percentage. He was known as a mediocre defensive player and played mainly as a designated hitter during the last two years of his career, despite his strong preference for playing in the field. Despite his success on the field, Bell had a love- hate relationship with the fans and media in Toronto, particularly in his later years as his declining defensive game came to overshadow his offensive talents. After the fans booed him for committing an error, he told the media that the fans could \"kiss my purple butt.\" The next day a sign appeared in left field \"George, we are behind you all the way.\" Bell's difficult relationship with the Toronto sports media was exacerbated by his reluctance to do interviews during his early years with the Blue Jays (which was due to his then-weak knowledge with the English language). Towards the end of his time in Toronto, however, Bell warmed to the media, who in turn began to soften their often harsh criticisms of his play and attitude. On May 28, 1989, while with the Blue Jays, Bell hit a walk-off home run in a 7–5 victory over the Chicago White Sox in the final Major League game played at Exhibition Stadium. Bell also homered in the first game at the Blue Jays' new park, SkyDome (now the Rogers Centre), on June 5, eight days later. George Bell is enshrined in the upper deck of the Rogers Centre's Level of Excellence, devoted to players and personnel who have made a significant impact as members of the Toronto Blue Jays. He shares the honor with Tony Fernández, Joe Carter, Cito Gaston, Pat Gillick, Dave Stieb, Tom Cheek, Carlos Delgado, Paul Beeston, and Roy Halladay. In 2004, he was inducted into the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame. In 2013, he was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame and Ontario Sports Hall of Fame. ==Career statistics== In 1587 games over 12 seasons, Bell posted a .278 batting average (1702-for-6123) with 814 runs, 308 doubles, 34 triples, 265 home runs, 1002 RBI, 331 base on balls, .316 on-base percentage and .469 slugging percentage. He recorded a .964 fielding percentage. In the 1985 and '89 ALCS, he hit .271 (13-for-48) with 6 runs, 1 home run and 3 RBI. ==Personal life== He is the older brother of late major leaguer Juan Bell. ==See also== * List of Toronto Blue Jays home run leaders * List of Major League Baseball career home run leaders * List of Major League Baseball players from the Dominican Republic * List of Major League Baseball career runs batted in leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual runs batted in leaders ==References== ==External links== Category:1959 births Category:American League All-Stars Category:American League Most Valuable Player Award winners Category:American League RBI champions Category:Azucareros del Este players Category:Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame inductees Category:Chicago Cubs players Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:Dominican Republic expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:Dominican Republic expatriate baseball players in the United States Category:Dominican Republic people of Cocolo descent Category:Helena Phillies players Category:Living people Category:Major League Baseball left fielders Category:Major League Baseball players from the Dominican Republic Category:National League All-Stars Category:Sportspeople from San Pedro de Macorís Category:Reading Phillies players Category:Silver Slugger Award winners Category:South Bend White Sox players Category:Spartanburg Phillies players Category:Syracuse Chiefs players Category:Tigres del Licey players Category:Toronto Blue Jays players",
