Wterloo Record, Aug 25, 2010 ==History== Constantines was formed in 1999 by vocalist and guitarist Bryan Webb, drummer Doug MacGregor and guitarist Paul Bright, all of whom had played together in the emo band Shoulder from 1994 to 1997; with the addition of bassist Dallas Wehrle. Bright was asked to leave early on and was replaced by Steve Lambke.\"Constantines\". The Canadian Encyclopedia, Janna Whelan, June 7, 2010 Their style has been described as \"art-punk\", and they have been compared to bands like The Clash, Fugazi, Bruce Springsteen, The Replacements, and Nick Cave. The name of the band is taken from an episode of Coast to Coast with Art Bell, in which Bell was playing recordings of ghost voices in static, and one of the ghosts' names was Constantine. From their hometown of Guelph the band relocated to London, Ontario and then to Toronto, where in 2001 they released their self-titled first album. Constantines enjoyed widespread play on campus radio and was nominated for a Juno Award for Best Alternative Album.\"The Constantines\". Pitchfork, by Jason Crock, October 16, 2005 The first track, \"Arizona\", is based on the suicide of Danny Rapp, the lead singer of Danny and the Juniors of \"At the Hop\" fame. The song begins with the lyric \"This is a song about the death of Danny Rapp. And that great gospel jest called rock 'n' roll.\" That year they performed at the El Mocambo in Toronto with Oneida and Grand Total.\"LIVE: The Constantines w/ Oneida And Grand Total\". Chart Attack, September 24, 2001. Review by: Brian Pascual In 2002 they added keyboard player Evan Gordon to the lineup and released the EP The Modern Sinner Nervous Man. Gordon left the band soon after to pursue his own song writing. He was replaced by Will Kidman, and the band released Shine a Light in 2003. This album was the band's first to be released outside of Canada on the Sub Pop record label. It topped the !earshot National Top 50 chart in September that year.\"The National Top 50 For the Week Ending: Tuesday, September 16, 2003\". !earshot. Shine a Light also earned the band their second Juno Award nomination for Alternative Album of the Year. In 2004, the label Sub Pop reissued the band's self-titled album.\" Constantines: The Constantines\" . Drowned in Sound, The next year, they embarked on a cross- Canada tour with The Weakerthans called The Rolling Tundra Revue. Later in the year their album Tournament of Hearts was released September 27 by Toronto record label Three Gut Records in Canada, and on October 11 by Sub Pop in the United States. The members of Constantines have occasionally played shows under the name Horsey Craze, covering Neil Young songs. In early 2006, they released a vinyl only split-album with The Unintended. Constantines recorded four Neil Young covers for the LP, while The Unintended performed four Gordon Lightfoot songs. In 2007, following the demise of their Canadian former record label Three Gut Records, Constantines signed with Arts & Crafts. On January 15, 2008, they released a limited edition 7\" on white vinyl, entitled Hard Feelings. Their fourth full-length album, Kensington Heights, was released on April 15 in Canada and April 29 in the US. Guitarist Steve Lambke has released four albums and a split 12\" under the name Baby Eagle, and keyboard player Will Kidman has recorded under the name Woolly Leaves. In December 2009, the band celebrated their tenth anniversary with a tour of southwestern Ontario. Shortly thereafter, keyboardist Will Kidman left the band. This, coupled with Webb's move from his home in Montreal back to Guelph, fueled rumours of the band's demise. Although Webb hinted that the band might return. thumb|right|The Constantines performing at the 2015 Hillside Festival in Guelph, ONConstantines went on an unofficial hiatus for several years.
