 "text": "A skin tag, or acrochordon (pl. acrochorda), is a small benign tumor that forms primarily in areas where the skin forms creases (or rubs together), such as the neck, armpit and groin. They may also occur on the face, usually on the eyelids. Though tags up to half an inch (12.7 mm) long have been seen, they are typically the size of a grain of rice. The surface of an acrochordon may be smooth or irregular in appearance and is often raised from the surface of the skin on a fleshy stalk called a peduncle. Microscopically, an acrochordon consists of a fibrovascular core, sometimes also with fat cells, covered by an unremarkable epidermis. However, tags may become irritated by shaving, clothing, jewellery or eczema. ==Etiology== Skin tags are thought to occur from skin rubbing up against skin, since they are so often found in skin creases and folds. Studies have shown existence of low-risk human papillomaviruses 6 and 11 in skin tags, hinting at a possible role in its pathogenesis although one 2012 study found no association between skin tags and low risk or high risk HPV. Acrochorda have been reported to have a prevalence of 46% in the general population. A causal genetic component is thought to exist. They are also more common in women than in men. Acrochorda were once thought to be associated with colorectal polyps, but studies have shown no such connection exists. Rarely, they can be associated with the Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome, acromegaly, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Elevated blood sugar and insulin is linked to an increased incidence of skin tags through an unknown mechanism. ==Treatment== If removal is desired or warranted, it can be achieved by a dermatologist, general practitioner or similarly trained professional who may use cauterization, cryosurgery, excision, laser, or surgical ligation to remove the acrochorda. Varied home remedies are also available, but most are unproven and some (e.g. tea tree oil) may cause allergic skin reactions. == See also == * Molluscum contagiosum (a viral disease which is similar in appearance and grows in similar areas) * List of cutaneous neoplasms associated with systemic syndromes *Papilloma *Cutaneous horn == References == == External links == Category:Dermal and subcutaneous growths",
