In other words, any number n is a prime number if, and only if, (n − 1)! + 1 is divisible by n.The Universal Book of Mathematics. David Darling, p. 350. ==History== This theorem was stated by Ibn al-Haytham (c. 1000 AD), and, in the 18th century, by John Wilson.Edward Waring, Meditationes Algebraicae (Cambridge, England: 1770), page 218 (in Latin). In the third (1782) edition of Waring's Meditationes Algebraicae, Wilson's theorem appears as problem 5 on page 380. On that page, Waring states: \"Hanc maxime elegantem primorum numerorum proprietatem invenit vir clarissimus, rerumque mathematicarum peritissimus Joannes Wilson Armiger.\" (A man most illustrious and most skilled in mathematics, Squire John Wilson, found this most elegant property of prime numbers.) Edward Waring announced the theorem in 1770, although neither he nor his student Wilson could prove it. Lagrange gave the first proof in 1771.Joseph Louis Lagrange, \"Demonstration d'un théorème nouveau concernant les nombres premiers\" (Proof of a new theorem concerning prime numbers), Nouveaux Mémoires de l'Académie Royale des Sciences et Belles- Lettres (Berlin), vol. 2, pages 125–137 (1771). There is evidence that Leibniz was also aware of the result a century earlier, but he never published it.Giovanni Vacca (1899) \"Sui manoscritti inediti di Leibniz\" (On unpublished manuscripts of Leibniz), Bollettino di bibliografia e storia delle scienze matematiche ... (Bulletin of the bibliography and history of mathematics), vol. 2, pages 113–116; see page 114 (in Italian). Vacca quotes from Leibniz's mathematical manuscripts kept at the Royal Public Library in Hanover (Germany), vol. 3 B, bundle 11, page 10: > Original : Inoltre egli intravide anche il teorema di Wilson, come risulta > dall'enunciato seguente: > > \"Productus continuorum usque ad numerum qui antepraecedit datum divisus per > datum relinquit 1 (vel complementum ad unum?) si datus sit primitivus. Si > datus sit derivativus relinquet numerum qui cum dato habeat communem > mensuram unitate majorem.\" > > Egli non giunse pero a dimostrarlo. > Translation : In addition, he [Leibniz] also glimpsed Wilson's theorem, as > shown in the following statement: > > \"The product of all integers preceding the given integer, when divided by > the given integer, leaves 1 (or the complement of 1?) if the given integer > be prime.

Because q divides n, let n = qk for some integer k. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that were congruent to where n is composite. Then (n-1)! would also be congruent to −1 (mod q) as (n-1)! \\equiv -1 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ n) implies that (n-1)! = nm - 1 = (qk)m - 1 = q(km) - 1 for some integer m which shows (n-1)! being congruent to -1 (mod q). But (n − 1)! ≡ 0 (mod q) by the fact that q is a term in (n-1)! making (n-1)! a multiple of q. A contradiction is now reached. In fact, more is true. With the sole exception of 4, where 3! = 6 ≡ 2 (mod 4), if n is composite then (n − 1)! is congruent to 0 (mod n). The proof is divided into two cases: First, if n can be factored as the product of two unequal numbers, , where 2 ≤ a < b ≤ n − 2, then both a and b will appear in the product and (n − 1)! will be divisible by n. If n has no such factorization, then it must be the square of some prime q, q > 2\\. But then 2q < q2 = n, both q and 2q will be factors of (n − 1)!, and again n divides (n − 1)!. ===Prime modulus=== ====Elementary proof==== The result is trivial when , so assume p is an odd prime, . Since the residue classes (mod p) are a field, every non-zero a has a unique multiplicative inverse, a−1. Lagrange's theorem implies that the only values of a for which are (because the congruence can have at most two roots (mod p)). Therefore, with the exception of ±1, the factors of can be arranged in unequal pairs,When n = 3, the only factors are ±1 where the product of each pair is . This proves Wilson's theorem. For example, if , :10! = [(1\\cdot10)]\\cdot[(2\\cdot6)(3\\cdot4)(5\\cdot9)(7\\cdot8)] \\equiv [-1]\\cdot[1\\cdot1\\cdot1\\cdot1] \\equiv -1 \\pmod{11}. ====Proof using Fermat's little theorem==== Again, the result is trivial for p = 2, so suppose p is an odd prime, . Consider the polynomial :g(x)=(x-1)(x-2) \\cdots (x-(p-1)). g has degree , leading term , and constant term . Its roots are 1, 2, ..., . Now consider :h(x)=x^{p-1}-1. h also has degree and leading term . Modulo p, Fermat's little theorem says it also has the same roots, 1, 2, ..., . Finally, consider :f(x)=g(x)-h(x). f has degree at most p − 2 (since the leading terms cancel), and modulo p also has the roots 1, 2, ..., . But Lagrange's theorem says it cannot have more than p − 2 roots. Therefore, f must be identically zero (mod p), so its constant term is . This is Wilson's theorem. ====Proof using the Sylow theorems==== It is possible to deduce Wilson's theorem from a particular application of the Sylow theorems. Let p be a prime. It is immediate to deduce that the symmetric group S_p has exactly (p-1)! elements of order p, namely the p-cycles C_p . On the other hand, each Sylow p-subgroup in S_p is a copy of C_p . Hence it follows that the number of Sylow p-subgroups is n_p=(p-2)! . The third Sylow theorem implies :(p-2)! \\equiv 1 \\pmod p. Multiplying both sides by gives :(p-1)! \\equiv p-1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod p, that is, the result. ====Proof using primitive roots==== Let be a primitive root modulo n of . Then a^{\\frac{p-1}{2}}\\equiv -1 \\pmod p, and all other a^k have a^{p-k-1} as a multiplicative inverse, because a^ka^{p-k-1}=a^{p-1}\\equiv 1 \\pmod p. As a^k runs through all the integers coprime to , we are done. ==Applications== ===Primality tests=== In practice, Wilson's theorem is useless as a primality test because computing (n − 1)! modulo n for large n is computationally complex, and much faster primality tests are known (indeed, even trial division is considerably more efficient). ===Quadratic residues=== Using Wilson's Theorem, for any odd prime , we can rearrange the left hand side of :1\\cdot 2\\cdots (p-1)\\ \\equiv\\ -1\\ \\pmod{p} to obtain the equality :1\\cdot(p-1)\\cdot 2\\cdot (p-2)\\cdots m\\cdot (p-m)\\ \\equiv\\ 1\\cdot (-1)\\cdot 2\\cdot (-2)\\cdots m\\cdot (-m)\\ \\equiv\\ -1 \\pmod{p}. This becomes :\\prod_{j=1}^m\\ j^2\\ \\equiv(-1)^{m+1} \\pmod{p} or :(m!)^2 \\equiv(-1)^{m+1} \\pmod{p}. We can use this fact to prove part of a famous result: for any prime p such that p ≡ 1 (mod 4), the number (−1) is a square (quadratic residue) mod p. For suppose p = 4k + 1 for some integer k. Then we can take m = 2k above, and we conclude that (m!)2 is congruent to (−1). ===Formulas for primes=== Wilson's theorem has been used to construct formulas for primes, but they are too slow to have practical value. ===p-adic gamma function=== Wilson's theorem allows one to define the p-adic gamma function. ==Gauss's generalization== Gauss proved thatGauss, DA, art. 78 : \\prod_{k = 1 \\atop \\gcd(k,m)=1}^m \\\\!\\\\!k \\ \\equiv \\begin{cases} -1 \\pmod{m} & \\text{if } m=4,\\;p^\\alpha,\\;2p^\\alpha \\\\\\ \\;\\;\\,1 \\pmod{m} & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} where p represents an odd prime and \\alpha a positive integer. The values of m for which the product is −1 are precisely the ones where there is a primitive root modulo m. This further generalizes to the fact that in any finite abelian group, either the product of all elements is the identity, or there is precisely one element a of order 2 (but not both). In the latter case, the product of all elements equals a. ==See also== *Wilson prime *Table of congruences ==Notes== ==References== The Disquisitiones Arithmeticae has been translated from Gauss's Ciceronian Latin into English and German.
