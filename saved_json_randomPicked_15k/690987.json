 "text": "Wrexham Maelor () was one of six local government districts of the county of Clwyd, north-east Wales, from 1974 to 1996. It was formed from parts of the administrative counties of Denbighshire and Flintshire. From Denbighshire came the municipal borough of Wrexham and Wrexham Rural District (less the parishes of Llangollen Rural and Llantysilio). From Flintshire came Maelor Rural District and the parish of Marford and Hoseley from Hawarden Rural District. The Flintshire areas had been exclaves, separated from the rest of the county by Denbighshire. The district was abolished in 1996, with its area forming the bulk of Wrexham County Borough.
