Deianira, p.111 She was the wife of Heracles and, in late Classical accounts, his unwitting murderer, killing him with the poisoned Shirt of Nessus. She is the main character in Sophocles' play Women of Trachis. == Family == Deianira was the daughter of Althaea and her husband Oeneus (whose name means \"wine-man\"), the king of Calydon (after the wine-god gave the king the vine to cultivate), and the half-sister of Meleager. Her other siblings were Toxeus, Clymenus, Periphas, Agelaus (or Ageleus), Thyreus (or Phereus or Pheres), Gorge, Eurymede and Melanippe.Hesiod, Ehoiai fr. 98 as cited in Berlin Papyri, No. 9777; Antoninus Liberalis, Metamorphoses 2 In some accounts, Deianira was the daughter of King Dexamenus of OlenusHyginus, Fabulae 31 & 33 and thus, sister to Eurypylus,Pausanias, Graeciae Descriptio 7.19.9 Theronice and Theraephone.Pausanias, Graeciae Descriptio 5.3.3 Others called this daughter of Dexamenus as MnesimacheApollodorus, 2.5.5 or Hippolyte.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca historica 4.33.1 Deianira was the mother of Hyllus, Glenus, Onites, Ctesippus, and Macaria, who saved the Athenians from defeat by Eurystheus. == Mythology and Literature == === Marriage === In Sophocles' account of Deianira's marriage, she was courted by the river god Achelous but saved from having to marry him by Heracles, who defeated Achelous in a wrestling contest for her hand in marriage. In another version of the tale where she was described as the daughter of Dexamenus, Heracles raped her and promised to come back and marry her. While he was away, the centaur Eurytion appeared and demanded her as his wife. Her father, being afraid, agreed, but Heracles returned before the marriage and slew the centaur and claimed his bride.Hyginus. Fabulae 31thumb|Deianira and the dying centaur Nessus telling her of the \"love charm\" / \"love potion\" (his own poisonous blood). |left Deianira was associated with combat, and was described as someone who \"drove a chariot and practiced the art of war.\"Apollodorus, 1.8.1 === Death of Heracles === The central story about Deianira concerns the Shirt of Nessus. A wild centaur named Nessus attempted to kidnap or rape Deianira as he was ferrying her across the river Euenos, but she was rescued by Heracles, who shot the centaur with a poisoned arrow. As he lay dying, Nessus persuaded Deianira to take a sample of his blood, telling her that a potion of it mixed with olive oil would ensure that Heracles would never again be unfaithful. Deianira believed his words and kept a little of the potion by her. Heracles fathered illegitimate children all across Greece and then fell in love with Iole. When Deianira thus feared that her husband would leave her forever, she smeared some of the blood on Heracles' famous lionskin shirt. Heracles' servant, Lichas, brought him the shirt and he put it on. The centaur's toxic blood burned Heracles terribly, and eventually, he threw himself into a funeral pyre. In despair, Deianira committed suicide by hanging herself or with a sword. === Middle Age tradition === She is remembered in De Mulieribus Claris, a collection of biographies of historical and mythological women by the Florentine author Giovanni Boccaccio, composed in 136162. It is notable as the first collection devoted exclusively to biographies of women in Western literature. == Calydonian family tree == == Notes == == References == === Primary sources === * Antoninus Liberalis, The Metamorphoses of Antoninus Liberalis translated by Francis Celoria (Routledge 1992).
