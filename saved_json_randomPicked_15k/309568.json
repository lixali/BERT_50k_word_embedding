I thought this might ease the tension a bit since he might take it easier on me. It was just the opposite. He turned me every way but loose.”Horrigan, Joe. \"An Aw Shucks Guy.\" Coffin Corner. 21.4 (1999): 3. Web. September 21, 2011. . Shaw played an amazing game, actually knocking the wind out of Eagle linebacker Maxie Baughan. In the 1961 draft, Shaw was drafted in the second round by the Buffalo Bills, and in the 14th round by the, then rival team of the Buffalo Bills, the Dallas Cowboys. “I had been in contact with the Cowboys mostly prior to the Bills getting involved,” recalled Shaw. “The Cowboys wanted to play me at linebacker. We had lengthy conversations at that point in time. The Bills wanted to play me at either defensive end or an offensive line position. I really wanted to play on the defensive side of the ball as a defensive end. So that triggered a real interest for me (in the Bills).”Brown, Chris. \"Bills All-Time draft memories: Billy Shaw.\" Buffalo Bills. Buffalo Bills, March 16, 2010. Web. September 28, 2011. . == Professional career == Billy Shaw was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys and the Buffalo Bills in the 1961 NFL and AFL Drafts, respectively, and decided to sign with the Bills.
