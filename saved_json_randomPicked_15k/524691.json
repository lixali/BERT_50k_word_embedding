 "text": "The University of Beira Interior (UBI; Portuguese: ) is a public university located in the city of Covilhã, Portugal. It was created in 1979, and has about 6,879 students distributed across a multiplicity of graduation courses, awarding all academic degrees in fields ranging from medicine, biochemistry, biomedical sciences and industrial design to aeronautical engineering, fashion design, mathematics, economics and philosophy. The university is named after the historical Beira region, meaning , the most interior area of Beira, mainly composed by the district of Guarda and the district of Castelo Branco, in today's Centro region. == History == In August 1973, following a major change in the national higher education system, the government established a polytechnical institution in Covilhã, the Polytechnic Institute of Covilhã (IPC - Instituto Politécnico da Covilhã), which was the first higher education institution in the city. Over the years, the IPC facilities, as well as the enrolment and staff, never ceased to grow. This growth and the region's needs, led the IPC to a remarkable level of achievements that granted it, in 1979, to be promoted, by the Portuguese Ministry of Education, to a higher institutional level, university institute. Seven years later, in 1986, the University Institute of Beira Interior was granted full university status and renamed University of Beira Interior (). == Organisation == For teaching and research purposes, UBI is organised into five faculties. The faculties are organised in departments: *The Faculty of Sciences includes the Department of Mathematics, Informatics, Physics, and Chemistry. *The Faculty of Engineering Sciences includes the departments of Textile Science and Technology, Paper Science and Technology, Electromechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, and Aerospace Sciences. *The Faculty of Human and Social Sciences is made up of the Department of Management and Economics, Department of Sociology, Department of Education Sciences and the Department of Sports Sciences. *The Faculty of Arts and Letters includes the Department of Communication and Arts; and the Department of Letters *The Faculty of Health Sciences includes the Department of Medical Sciences. All departments of the university grant the undergraduate degree (licentiate's degree or bachelor's degree), which requires a three-year full-time study programme. UBI also awards postgraduate courses in the fields that are offered by its departments, granting the degrees of (master's degree) and (Ph.D.). In order to supply its own needs and those of the local community itself, the university has also five centres: the Teaching and Learning Resources Centre (CREA); the Centre for Patrimonial Studies and Recovery (CEPP); the Computer Centre (CI); the Optics Centre (CO) and the Centre of Studies for Regional Development (CEDR) which establishes the interface between the university and the community providing consulting services to local institutions in the areas of regional development. The Centro Hospitalar Universitário Cova da Beira (Cova da Beira University Hospital Center), with facilities in Covilhã and Fundão, is the teaching hospital of the University of Beira Interior. Hospitals of Castelo Branco and Guarda also collaborate with UBI's Faculty of Health Sciences. ==Rankings== In 2020, the University of Beira Interior (UBI) maintained the status of one of the best international academies founded less than 50 years ago. The Times Higher Education Young University Rankings 2020 (THE-YUR) placed UBI at 151-200, within a list that analyzed 414 institutions of higher education around the world. UBI repeated the rank of the previous ranking, although the competition is increasing. In 2019, 351 academies had been analyzed, 63 less than this year. The rise in the number of institutions, however, did not jeopardize the position of UBI among the elite of the youngest universities from 66 countries on five continents. When analyzing the performance of the Portuguese institutions included in THE-YUR, UBI is in the second best level reached by the eight national higher education institutions, with only one ahead of it. In the parameter \"Citations\" it is even the best Portuguese academy on the list, appearing in 3rd place in \"Internationalization\". Compared to 2019, UBI improved its final score in four of the five major missions of universities, used for the construction of the study: \"Teaching\", \"Research\", \"Knowledge Transfer\" and \"Internationalization\". To prepare the Times Higher Education Young University Rankings are used the same 13 performance indicators of the main rankings of THE, as the World University Ranking, in which UBI is also included. Universities are evaluated on their main missions - teaching, research, knowledge transfer and internationalization - to allow the most comprehensive and balanced comparisons possible. In THE-YUR the weighting elements are calibrated to reflect the missions of young universities, with less emphasis on reputation surveys and more on factors such as research productivity, staff-to-student ratios and doctoral training, among others.UBI continua entre as melhores universidades jovens do mundo (Notícias da Covilhã) https://noticiasdacovilha.pt/ubi-continua-entre-as-melhores-universidades- jovens-do-mundo/UBI melhora avaliações no ranking das universidades jovens do mundo (beira.pt) https://beira.pt/portal/noticias/ubi-melhora-avaliacoes-no- ranking-das-universidades-jovens-do-mundo/ == Rectoral Team == The rector is elected by the General Council for a term of four years and is assisted by vice-rectors and pro-rectors in specific tasks. * Rector: António Carreto Fidalgo * Vice-rectors: Mário Lino Barata Raposo (finance area and projects), Paulo Rodrigues Lima Vargas Moniz (research area) and João Manuel Messias Canavilhas (teaching, internationalisation and career prospects) * Pro- rectors: Isabel Maria Romano da Cunha (quality area), José Carlos Páscoa Marques (project area) and Manuel Carlos Loureiro Lemos (coordination with the community in the health area) == Courses == thumb|right|250px|An old wool factory was rebuilt to accommodate the Engineering building, inaugurated on 8 May 2000. === 1st-cycle degrees === *Bioengineering *Biochemistry *Biotechnology *Biomedical Sciences *Cinema *Communication Sciences *Computer Science and Engineering *Fashion Design *Industrial Design *Multimedia Design *Economics *Electrical and Computer Engineering *Electromechanical Engineering *Portuguese and Spanish Studies *Management *Industrial Chemistry *Marketing *Optometry – Vision Sciences *Political Science and International Relations *Psychology *Sciences of Culture *Sociology *Sports Sciences *Web Informatics ==== Integrated Master's degrees ==== * Architecture * Civil Engineering * Aeronautical Engineering * Medicine * Pharmaceutical Sciences === 2nd-cycle degrees === * Biochemistry * Bioengineering * Biomedical Sciences * Biotechnology * Branding and Fashion Design * Cinema * Clinical and Health Psychology * Computer Science and Engineering * Fashion Design * Industrial and Technological Design * Multimedia Design * Didactic, Cultural, Linguistic and Literary Studies * Economics * Electrical and Computer Engineering * Electromechanical Engineering * Entrepreneurship and Social Innovation * Teaching of Physical Education in Basic and Secondary School * Entrepreneurship and Firm Creation * Entrepreneurship and Social Service * Game Design and Development * Geographic Information Systems * Industrial Chemistry * Industrial Engineering and Management * Journalism * Lusophone Studies * Management * Management of Health Units * Marketing * Mathematics for Teachers * Medicinal Chemistry * Optometry in Vision Sciences * Pedagogical Supervision * Political Science * International Relations * Sociology: Exclusion and Social Policies * Sports Sciences * Strategic Communication: Advertising and Public Relations * Teaching of Mathematics in the 3rd Cycle of Basic Education and in Secondary Education * Teaching of Philosophy in Secondary Education * Teaching of Physics and Chemistry in the 3rd Cycle of Basic Education and in Secondary Education * Teaching of Portuguese and Spanish in the 3rd Cycle of Basic Education and in Secondary School * Teaching of the Visual Arts in the 3rd Cycle of Basic Education and Secondary Education * Textile Engineering === 3rd-cycle degrees === * Advanced Materials and Processing * Aeronautical Engineering * Biochemistry * Biomedicine * Chemistry * Civil Engineering * Communication Sciences * Communication Studies: Technology, Culture and Society * Computer Engineering * Economics * Education * Electrical and Computer Engineering * Fashion Design * Industrial Engineering and Management * Management * Marketing and Strategy * Mathematics and Applications * Mechanical Engineering * Medicine * Paper Engineering * Pharmaceutical Sciences * Philosophy * Physics * Political Science * Psychology * Sociology * Sports Sciences * Textile Engineering == Enrolment and staff == Current figures show an enrolment of approximately 7000 students from all over the country plus 693 professors and lecturers.

This building served as a spinning, dyeing and weaving mill until 1885, when it was handed over to lodge the (21st Infantry Regiment), and later the (2nd Sharpshooters Battalion). In 1975, during the recovery and adaptation works of the building, archaeological remains of the old textile mill were discovered. The vats of the former dye- house were found. The discovery was classified as a part of the national cultural heritage and it was carefully recovered and restored. According to the museum's educational role, the discovered structures are helping to portray the dyeing processes used in Portugal in the second half of the 18th century. Guided tours are available (free for UBI students). The museum is open on weekdays except Monday, from 09:30 to midday and from 14:30 to 18:00. == See also == *List of universities in Portugal *Higher education in Portugal *Air Cargo Challenge ==References== == External links == *University of Beira Interior *UBI (Pólo I) viewed from satellite *UBI on Facebook Category:Educational institutions established in 1979 Beira Category:1979 establishments in Portugal Category:Buildings and structures in Castelo Branco District Category:Covilhã Category:Medical education in Portugal Category:Medical and health organisations based in Portugal",
