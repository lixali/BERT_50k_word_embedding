During times of political unrest, such as the French Revolution, pamphleteers were highly active in attempting to shape public opinion. Before the advent of telecommunications, those with access to a printing press and a supply of paper often used pamphlets to widely disseminate their ideas. == Famous pamphleteers == Thomas Paine's pamphlets were influential in the history of the American Revolutionary War.James A.
