 "text": "{| |} In Australia, Aarhus Historic Shipwreck is a historical site preserving one of the victims of Smith's Rock. The Aarhus was a 640-tonne sailing barque built in 1875 in Hamburg, Germany. The vessel measured in length. While carrying a general cargo including kerosene from New York to Brisbane, Australia, they hit Smith's Rock, which lies about two nautical miles (4 km) north-east of Cape Moreton, and sank on 24 February 1894. The remains of the ship now lie upright in 20 metres of water, though most of the ship has been reduced to plates and ribs sticking out of the sand. It has been gazetted under Section 7 of the Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976 which provides for a special protected zone of 200m around the wreck. The Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976 was superseded in 2019 with the Underwater Cultural Heritage Act 2018 Any disturbance activity is prohibited; divers are required to apply to the Department of the Environment and Science (QLD State) for a permit to access the wreck. This site has much interesting sea-life, from small to large batfish at cleaning stations everywhere. Another point of interest is the large mast-like object that is actually the bowsprit. This area reportedly has a cat shark inhabiting the bowsprit and a large wobbegong shark under the scoured out section. The site can have very good visibility but a strong current makes it hard to see the entire wreck in one dive. ==See also== *Lists of shipwrecks ==References== Aarhus Category:Shipwrecks of Queensland Category:Ships built in Hamburg Category:1875 ships Category:Maritime incidents in 1894 Category:1871â€“1900 ships of Australia Category:1894 in Australia Category:Merchant ships of Australia Category:Victorian-era merchant ships of the United Kingdom Category:Barques of Australia Category:Australian Shipwrecks with protected zone",
