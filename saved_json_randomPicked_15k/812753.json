 "text": "The Young and the Hopeless is the second studio album by American rock band Good Charlotte. Following the release of their self-titled debut album (2000), the band met producer Eric Valentine and engaged him for their next album. Sessions lasted from February to May 2002; Josh Freese of the Vandals served as a session drummer. Almost all of the songs on the album were written by Benji and Joel Madden but two tracks were co-written with Valentine and Goldfinger frontman John Feldmann. Drummer Chris Wilson joined the band, prior to the release of \"Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous\" in September. On October 1, 2002, The Young and the Hopeless was released by Epic and Daylight Records. It was promoted with a support slot for No Doubt before the group embarked on their own headlining US tour, with subsequent shows of Japan, Europe, Australia and New Zealand in the following months. \"The Anthem\" was released as a single in February 2003 prior to the band co-headlining the Honda Civic Tour with New Found Glory between April and June. \"Girls & Boys\" was released as a single in July. From September to November, the band embarked on a headlining US arena tour, during which they made music videos for \"Hold On\" and \"The Young & the Hopeless\", the former was first released to alternative rock radio, and later as a joint single, with \"The Young & the Hopeless\", in January 2004. The Young and the Hopeless received generally mixed reviews from music critics, who made comments about the songs' clichéd lyrics. The album was a major commercial success, being certified three times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Three of the album's singles—\"Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous\", \"The Anthem\", and \"Girls & Boys\"—crossed over from modern rock radio to pop radio. Outside the US, the album charted within the top 20 in New Zealand, Sweden, Australia, the UK, and Austria, and reached lower positions in Japan, Germany, Switzerland, France, and the Netherlands. It was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), as well as two times platinum by Music Canada (MC). The album and \"Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous\" were nominated for several awards, with the latter winning the Kerrang! Award for Best Single. The album appeared on best-of lists by Rock Sound and Rolling Stone, and earned the Classic Album Award at the Alternative Press Music Awards. ==Background and recording== After leaving their home state of Maryland, Good Charlotte were signed to Epic imprint Daylight Records and released their debut album, Good Charlotte (2000). It did not sell as well as the label hoped, and the group were nearly dropped. The minor success of \"Little Things\", coupled with appearing at Warped Tour and touring alongside Blink-182 in 2001 helped increase their popularity. Sometime afterwards, drummer Aaron Escolopio left the group to join his brother's band Wakefield. He was replaced by Nate Foutz of Vroom, who stayed with the group for six weeks. Dusty Bill was then engaged to play drums; he remained with the group for a year. While promoting the self-titled album, the group met Eric Valentine at a show, and decided to work with him on their next record. Valentine, who acted as producer, said he was interested in the band because of their writing, which he felt was \"a little deeper\" than that of their contemporaries. Joel Madden said they \"wanted a hit record, to do something big and important ... and that’s where [Valentine] came in\". Recording of The Young and the Hopeless took place at Barefoot Studios in Los Angeles, California, between February 1 and May 1, 2002. Valentine often mediated between the band members, who would bicker during pre-production. Josh Freese of The Vandals was brought in as a session member; Joel Madden knew Freese from touring and asked him to drum on the album. Valentine and Ken Allardyce acted as engineers, while Jason Slate, Dave Cooley and Wes Seidman did additional editing. David Campbell conducted strings, which were arranged by Valentine and Eric Campbell and engineered by Nate Kunkel. Valentine mixed the recordings and Brian Gardner mastered them at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Los Angeles. Benji Madden said, \"Nothing about that record was pre-meditated, we were just having fun, and trying to do the best we could to achieve that goal\". In 2016, Benji Madden said of the album: \"We’d gone out into the world and felt both the positive and the negative. And on The Young And The Hopeless we decided to really take a direction and stand up for ourselves, in a way.\"Travers 2016, p. 29 ==Composition== Discussing the album name, Joel Madden said; The Young and the Hopeless \"felt like the generation we were in ... I think it was the way a generation felt in the early 2000s. Everything started to change over.\" All of the songs on the album were written by the Madden brothers, except for \"A New Beginning\" and \"The Anthem\". The former was written by Benji Madden and Valentine, and the latter was written by the Madden brothers and Goldfinger frontman John Feldmann. All of the songs were arranged by the band, except \"A New Beginning\", which was arranged by Benji Madden and Valentine. Musically, the album has been described as pop punk, and compared with the work of MxPx. With the opening track \"A New Beginning\", the group wanted to make something different. According to Joel Madden, \"we love the Danny Elfman stuff, so we just did it [in his style]\". \"The Anthem\" was written after producers of an unspecified movie asked for a song to include on the soundtrack.McMahon, ed. 2015, p. 20 According to Benji Madden, the producers wanted a song similar to \"Little Things\", asking; \"Can you write another loser anthem?\" The brothers wrote it with Feldmann because they loved Goldfinger and wanted to work with him before they worked with Valentine and Don Gilmore. The movie producers used \"Little Things\" instead; as a result, \"The Anthem\" features the lyric \"Another loser anthem\". The latter's bridge was written as a joke and was intended to be replaced later but was left on the album.Slessor 2016, p. 43 \"Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous\" features the drum motif of \"Lust for Life\" (1977) by Iggy Pop, and is social commentary about the freedom celebrities have. While \"The Story of My Old Man\" is predominantly about the Madden brothers' father, it references Benji Madden's experience with alcohol.Small 2003, p. 67 They briefly considered not releasing the track, which they found embarrassing, but they included it on the album because they felt their fans might relate to it. \"Girls & Boys\" was written after an evening during which the Madden brothers tried to enter a club but were twice turned away. They were allowed into a third club; according to Benji Madden, they were \"just kids without a lot of experience, just kind of observing what was going on\". He discovered the \"dynamic of certain types of people with different agendas ... to be amusing\". They wrote the song the following day. \"My Bloody Valentine\" is about a man who kills the boyfriend of the woman he has a crush for. \"Hold On\" is an anti-suicide song that talks about coping with life; Joel Madden wrote it after receiving letters from fans, who said the band helped them through difficult periods of their lives. \"Riot Girl\" evokes the work of Rancid. \"Say Anything\" is a string-laden ballad that originated in 1999 under the name \"Time After Time\", when it had a different set of lyrics. \"Emotionless\" was written about the realization the Madden brothers would not talk to their father again. Madden said; \"We have to come to our own kind of closure. It’s kind of a song we wrote for ourselves\". ==Release== During Good Charlotte's appearance on 2002 Warped Tour, Autopilot Off's Phil Robinson was filling in as Good Charlotte's temporary drummer; the Used, who were aware Good Charlotte needed a drummer, introduced them to Chris Wilson. Shortly after this, Wilson became the group's drummer. In July 2002, the group filmed a video for \"Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous\"; it was directed by Bill Fishman and features appearances from 'NSYNC vocalist Chris Kirkpatrick, Tenacious D guitarist Kyle Gass, and Minutemen bassist Mike Watt. In the video, the group perform inside a mansion, before police surround the building. The band are arrested and appear in a courtroom. The song was released to modern rock radio on August 13 that yearDaugherty 2002, p. 12 and was released as a CD single on September 9. It includes the tracks \"Cemetery\", \"The Click\" and an acoustic version of \"Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous\" as B-sides.

In mid-June 2003, the Madden brothers sung at KROQ Weenie Roast acoustically because Good Charlotte's guitarist Martin had to attend a wedding. In August, the group performed at the MTV Video Music Awards. When playing at the Reading and Leeds Festivals, the audience's reaction was very negative and some of them bottled the band.

On November 12, the band appeared on Total Request Live. In December, the group went toured the UK with Sugarcult and Mest.

Mark Beaumont of NME wrote a positive review, saying, \"This is the sudden extra fold of punk-pop's cerebral cortex, the evolutionary leap into an unexpected maturity\". A reviewer for Uncut was slightly more positive, commenting, \"Though, on occasion, they are Green Day-lite, there are enough solid rock moments to keep their youthful following happy\". Melodic webmaster Johan Wippsson said while the band does not stand out from their contemporaries, it's \"quite hard not to be charmed by their catchy style\". In his brief review, rock critic Robert Christgau said; \"honest pop band presents its songs punk, and that makes some people so mad\". Rolling Stone writer Greg Kot said the group was \"much more persuasive when they let their vulnerability crack through the surface of these slightly overbaked songs, in which elaborate production touches mask the band's three-chord limitations\". Kristina Feliciano of Entertainment Weekly deemed the record generic, writing; \"These 14 tidily produced songs not only sound a lot like each other, they also resemble ones by someone else—namely, blink-182. And that band’s tunes derive from elsewhere still.\" AllMusic reviewer Tom Semioli called it \"downright predictable\", an album that \"rehash[es] worn clichés aplenty on each track\". Chart Attack Steve Servos also referred to it as \"boring, sappy\", and having \"clichéd lyrics of hard knocks and spoiled celebrities\". PopMatters writer Adrien Begrand was very negative; when citing lyrics on the album that criticize reviews, he responded, \"Maybe if the band dropped all the pretense of their supposed punk aesthetic, from the spiky hair to the piercings, and actually wrote and produced albums that contain good, honest, DIY substance, and not this corporate rock sodapop garbage, then perhaps they could find something a bit more pertinent to complain about\". ===Accolades=== The Young and the Hopeless was nominated for the Choice Music: Album award at the 2003 Teen Choice Awards. The \"Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous\" music video was nominated for Best Group Video, Best Rock Video and Viewer's Choice awards at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards winning the Viewer's Choice award. \"Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous\" won a 2003 Kerrang!
