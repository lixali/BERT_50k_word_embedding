 "text": "Jyutping is a romanisation system for Cantonese developed by the Linguistic Society of Hong Kong (LSHK), an academic group, in 1993. Its formal name is the Linguistic Society of Hong Kong Cantonese Romanization Scheme. The LSHK advocates for and promotes the use of this romanisation system. The name Jyutping (itself the Jyutping romanisation of its Chinese name, ) is a contraction consisting of the first Chinese characters of the terms Jyut6jyu5 (, meaning \"Yue language\") and ping3jam1 ( \"phonetic alphabet\", also pronounced as \"pinyin\" in Mandarin). Despite being a romanisation system to indicate pronunciations, some enthusiasts actually employ Jyutping to explore writing Cantonese as an alphabetic language, elevating it from its assistive status to a written language in effect. ==History== The Jyutping system marks a departure from all previous Cantonese romanisation systems (approximately 12, including Robert Morrison's pioneering work of 1828, and the widely used Standard Romanization, Yale and Sidney Lau systems) by introducing z and c initials and the use of eo and oe in finals, as well as replacing the initial y, used in all previous systems, with j. In 2018, the Jyutping system was updated to include the -a and -oet finals, to reflect syllables recognized to be part of Cantonese phonology in 1997 by the Jyutping Work Group of the Linguistic Society of Hong Kong. == Initials == {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- |b |p |m |f | |- |d |t |n | |l |- |g |k |ng |h | |- |gw |kw | | |w |- |z |c | |s |j |} == Finals == {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- |aa |aai |aau |aam |aan |aang |aap |aat |aak |- |a |ai |au |am |an |ang |ap |at |ak |- |e |ei |eu |em | |eng |ep | |ek |- |i | |iu |im |in |ing |ip |it |ik |- |o |oi |ou | |on |ong | |ot |ok |- |u |ui | | |un |ung | |ut |uk |- | |eoi | | |eon | | |eot | |- |oe | | | | |oeng | |oet |oek |- |yu | | | |yun | | |yut | |- | | | |m | |ng | | | |} * Only the finals m and ng can be used as standalone nasal syllables. * Referring to the colloquial pronunciation of these words. * Used for elided words in casual speech such as a6 in 四十四 (sei3a6sei3), elided from sei3 sap6 sei3. * Used for onomatopoeias such as oet6 for belching or goet4 for snoring. == Tones == There are nine tones in six distinct tone contours in Cantonese. However, as three of the nine are entering tones (), which only appear in syllables ending with p, t, and k, they do not have separate tone numbers in Jyutping (though they do in Cantonese Pinyin; these are shown in parentheses in the table below). A mnemonic which some use to remember this is 「風水到時我哋必發達」or “Feng Shui [dictates that] we will be lucky.” {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" !Tone name !jam1ping4 ()||jam1soeng5 ()||jam1heoi3 () !joeng4ping4 ()||joeng4soeng5 ()||joeng4heoi3 () !gou1jam1jap6 ()||dai1jam1jap6 ()||joeng4jap6 () |- !Tone number |1||2||3 |4||5||6 |1||3||6 |- !The tone name in English |high level or high falling||mid rising||mid level |low falling||low rising||low level |entering high level||entering mid level||entering low level |- !ContourMatthews, S.; Yip, V.

But they differ in the following: * The vowels eo and oe represent and respectively in Jyutping, whereas the eu represents both vowels in Yale. * The initial j represents in Jyutping whereas y is used instead in Yale. * The initial z represents in Jyutping whereas j is used instead in Yale. * The initial c represents in Jyutping whereas ch is used instead in Yale. * In Jyutping, if no consonant precedes the vowel yu, then the initial j is appended before the vowel. In Yale, the corresponding initial y is never appended before yu under any circumstances. * Jyutping defines three finals not in Yale: eu , em , and ep . These three finals are used in colloquial Cantonese words, such as deu6 (), lem2 (), and gep6 (). * To represent tones, only tone numbers are used in Jyutping whereas Yale traditionally uses tone marks together with the letter h (though tone numbers can be used in Yale as well). == Comparison with Cantonese pinyin == Jyutping and Cantonese Pinyin represent Cantonese pronunciations with the same letters in: * The initials: b, p, m, f, d, t, n, l, g, k, ng, h, s, gw, kw, j, w. * The vowel: aa, a, e, i, o, u. * The nasal stop: m, ng. * The coda: i (except for its use in the coda in Jyutping; see below), u, m, n, ng, p, t, k. But they have some differences: * The vowel oe represents both and in Cantonese Pinyin whereas eo and oe represent and respectively in Jyutping. * The vowel y represents in Cantonese Pinyin whereas both yu (used in the nucleus) and i (used in the coda of the final -eoi) are used in Jyutping. * The initial dz represents in Cantonese Pinyin whereas z is used instead in Jyutping. * The initial ts represents in Cantonese Pinyin whereas c is used instead in Jyutping. * To represent tones, the numbers 1 to 9 are usually used in Cantonese Pinyin, although the use of 1, 3, 6 to replace 7, 8, 9 for the checked tones is acceptable. However, only the numbers 1 to 6 are used in Jyutping. == Examples == {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !Traditional !Simplified !Romanization |- | | |Gwong2 zau1 waa2 |- | | |Jyut6 jyu5 |- | | |nei5 hou2 |} Sample transcription of one of the 300 Tang Poems: {| style=\"margin:auto; font-size:larger; text-align:left;\" |- ! width=200 | || Ceon1 Hiu2 Maang6 Hou6 Jin4 |- | || Ceon1 min4 bat1 gok3 hiu2, |- | || cyu3 cyu3 man4 tai4 niu5. |- | || Je6 loi4 fung1 jyu5 sing1, |- | || faa1 lok6 zi1 do1 siu2? |} ==Jyutping input method== The Jyutping method () refers to a family of input methods based on the Jyutping romanization system. The Jyutping method allows a user to input Chinese characters by entering the jyutping of a Chinese character (with or without tone, depending on the system) and then presenting the user with a list of possible characters with that pronunciation. ===List of Jyutping keyboard input utilities=== *Online Jyutping Input Method () *MDBG Type Chinese *Red Dragonfly () *LSHK Jyutping for Macintosh Mac OS X and OS 9 (The page also includes Yale input version 0.2) *Hong Kong Cantonese 2010 (via Microsoft Office IME 2010) *Canton Easy Input () *Cantonese Phonetic IME () (also called 'Cantonese Phonetic IME (CPIME) Jyutping' in Windows 10FAQ: How to select Cantonese Phonetic IME (CPIME) in Windows 10) *RIME () *Gboard ==See also== * Cantonese phonology ==Footnotes== == Further reading == * == External links == * Jyutping Pronunciation Guide * : Learning the phonetic system of Cantonese * Chinese Character Database (Phonologically Disambiguated According to the Cantonese Dialect) * The CantoDict Project is a dedicated Cantonese-Mandarin-English online dictionary which uses Jyutping by default * MDBG free online Chinese- English dictionary (supports both Jyutping and Yale romanization) Category:Languages of Hong Kong Category:Cantonese romanisation Category:Writing systems introduced in 1993 Category:Romanization of Chinese",
