 "text": "The \"National Anthem of the Islamic Republic of Iran\" (; ) is the national song of the Islamic Republic of Iran. It was adopted in 1990, replacing the previous national anthem used during the rule of Ruhollah Khomeini, called Pâyande Bâdâ Irân. It was composed by Hassan Riyahi, and the lyrics were written by Sayed Bagheri. It is the fourth official Iranian national anthem. ==History== Due to the death of Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini in 1989, Iran adopted its current anthem after a competition the following year. At the time of its adoption, it was the second-shortest anthem in the world, after Japan's anthem, Kimigayo, with seven lines. Concurrently, the anthem is not recognized by a number of Iranian opposition groups and diaspora communities, who continue to use \"Ey Iran\" instead. ==Lyrics== {|cellpadding=\"6\" |- !Persian lyrics !English translation |- | {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\" |- !Persian original !Romanization of Persian !IPA transcription |- | | | |} |Upwards on the horizon rises the Eastern Sun, The light in the eyes of the believers in truth, Bahman is the zenith of our faith.
