 "text": "Drop the Beat was a Canadian television series produced by Back Alley Film Productions, which aired on CBC Television in 2000 and 2001.\"TV show puts spotlight on hip-hop\". Sudbury Star, February 9, 2000. A short-run dramatic series, the show was one of the first television series in the world centred around hip hop music and culture. A spinoff of the earlier CBC teen drama series Straight Up,\"CBC finds a home for good and bad of the hip-hop scene\". Ottawa Citizen, February 7, 2000. the show starred Mark Taylor as Jeff and Merwin Mondesir as Dennis, the hosts of a hip hop show on CIBJ-FM, a fictional campus radio station in Toronto, Ontario.\"Yo, big up -- CBC goes hip-hop urban\". The Globe and Mail, February 7, 2000. Michie Mee also starred as Divine, a rapper who was part of Jeff and Dennis' crew, and Ingrid Veninger played the station manager. The supporting cast also included Arlene Duncan, Vanessa Ford, Jennifer Baxter, Jason Harrow, Shamann Williams and Omari Forrester. The use of a campus radio station was a deliberate reflection of Canadian reality â€” until Toronto's Flow 93.5 hit the airwaves in early 2001, Canada did not have any radio stations dedicated specifically to urban music. ==Production== As a tie-in to help promote emerging hip hop musicians, the series released a soundtrack album in conjunction with the first season, featuring artists such as Maestro Fresh Wes, Infinite, Frankie Ano, Bahamadia, Ja Rule, Black Child, Choclair, Rahzel, Jully Black and Erykah Badu.\"Drop the Beat becomes a CD: Canada's first hip hop TV show releases soundtrack\".
