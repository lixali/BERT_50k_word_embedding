 "text": "Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) is a public collaborative university between Indiana University and Purdue University that offers undergraduate, graduate, and professional degrees from both systems. Administered primarily through Indiana University as a core campus and secondarily through Purdue University as a regional campus, it is Indiana’s primary urban research and academic health sciences institution. IUPUI is located in downtown Indianapolis along the White River and Fall Creek. Among more than 550 degree programs, the urban university hosts the primary campuses for both the Indiana University School of Medicine, with more than 2,000 students, and the Indiana University School of Dentistry, the only dental school in the state. Also represented among the graduate schools, the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law is one of the two Indiana University law schools, with the Indiana University Maurer School of Law being the Bloomington equivalent. IUPUI is classified among \"R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity.\" The IUPUI Jaguars compete in the NCAA's Division I in the Horizon League. Several athletics venues are located on the campus, including the IU Michael A. Carroll Track & Soccer Stadium and Indiana University Natatorium, the largest indoor pool in the United States with a seating capacity of 4,700. ==History== Founded in 1969, IUPUI (colloquially known as \"Ooey-Pooey\") is an urban campus in Indianapolis, the 15th largest city in the United States, with a population of two million in the metropolitan statistical area. The campus is just west of downtown, within walking distance of the state capitol and other governmental offices, and the site of numerous nationally renowned businesses and art, sports, education, and health facilities. In 1968, Dr. Maynard K. Hine, dean of the IU School of Dentistry began working with then-Mayor of Indianapolis Richard Lugar, IU President Joseph L. Sutton, Purdue President Frederick L. Hovde, and others to establish IUPUI in 1969 through the merger of the Indianapolis extension programs of both IU and Purdue. Some schools, however, were established before the merger, including the IU School of Medicine, IU School of Dentistry, IU Robert H. McKinney School of Law, IU School of Liberal Arts, and IU Herron School of Art. IUPUI includes the nation’s largest nursing school, the main campus of the largest medical school in the country, the only dental school in the state, and the country’s oldest school of physical education. IUPUI is among the top 20 campuses in the nation for graduate professional degrees conferred. As a core campus of Indiana University, IUPUI is primarily governed by the IU Board of Trustees. Purdue University degree-granting programs are governed by the Purdue University Board of Trustees. While integrated into the Indiana University system budget, IUPUI is semi-autonomous in that it retains some independent control of its own academic curricula. ==Academics== IUPUI is one of nine campuses of the Indiana University system and one of five campuses of the Purdue University system. The campus offers more than 550 degree programs provided by 17 different schools, two of which are Purdue University schools. IUPUI has more students from the state of Indiana than any other campus in the state, the largest number of underrepresented minorities in the Indiana University system, and the largest population of graduate and professional students of any university in Indiana. Almost 75 percent of IUPUI classes have 25 or fewer students. IUPUI has more than 3,800 full-time faculty members. With research funding of more than $535 million, IUPUI is the second- largest site for research in Indiana. ===Schools and departments=== ====Departmental Histories==== {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; font-size:90%; line-height:1.4em; width:280px;\" | colspan=\"2\" | |- | College/School || Year founded |- | Indiana University School of Medicine || 1911 |- | Indiana University Indianapolis Extension Center || 1916 |- | Indiana University School of Dentistry || 1944 |- | Purdue University Indianapolis Extension Center || 1946 |- | Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law || 1954 |- | Indiana University Herron School of Art || 1967 |} IUPUI is home to several education programs that date to the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. These institutions include medical, dental, nursing, physical education, law and art schools. While they began as independent operations, the institutions were later acquired by Indiana University and became a part of IUPUI when it opened in 1969.Several predecessor schools merged with IU, later becoming IUPUI, according to this article accessed 22 Aug 2020. The Normal College of the American Gymnastic Union had been in operation since 1866, first in New York, then Milwaukee, and in 1907 finally moving to space in the east wing of the historic Indianapolis building, the Athenæum (Das Deutsche Haus).[file:///C:/Users/Thomas/Downloads/Physical_Education_Bulletin_1929_1930.pdf Noted in the school's 1929-30 Bulletin], accessed 21 Aug 2020. This school trained physical education teachers for schools across the country. An affiliation began in September 1932 between the two institutions: the Normal College and Indiana University. Indiana University incorporated the school in 1941 as a department, calling it the School of Health, Physical Education, and Recreation of Indiana University, where freshmen and sophomores would spend those years at the Indianapolis campus, and shift to the Bloomington campus in their junior and senior years. This merger therefore brought into Indiana University the oldest American institution for the training of teachers of physical and health education and recreation, called the School of Physical Education of IUPUI as of 1973. Today the school is known as the IU School of Physical Education and Tourism Management. According to that school's 1957-58 Bulletin, accessed 21 Aug 2020. The Indiana Dental College opened in 1879 following the passage of a law by the Indiana legislature requiring dentists to show proof that they had graduated from a professional dental college or university. At the time, there were few such colleges in the United States and none operating within Indiana. The need for such an institution was met with the creation of the Indiana Dental College in Indianapolis, the first such institution in the state. The college operated independently until 1925, when it was acquired by Indiana University. Several early law schools combined into what is now known as the Indiana University School of Law Indianapolis. The earliest of these, the Indiana Law School, opened in 1894, soon followed by the Indianapolis College of Law in 1898 and the American Central Law School around 1900. In 1914, the latter two, the Indianapolis and American Central law schools, merged under the name, Benjamin Harrison Law School. In 1936, the Indiana and Benjamin Harrison law schools coalesced, taking the name, the Indiana Law School. This institution then affiliated with Indiana University in 1944. The IU School of Medicine is a mix of several early medical colleges: In 1869, the Medical College of Indiana opened in Indianapolis. In 1879, two more medical schools opened—the Central College of Physicians and Surgeons in Indianapolis and the Fort Wayne College of Medicine. In 1905, the three colleges merged under the name Medical College of Indiana. Meanwhile, IU Bloomington's own medical program began in 1903. In 1906, a fifth medical school, the State College of Physicians and Surgeons began operation in the state. This program merged with IU in 1907. Then in 1908, IU acquired the Medical College of Indiana. That same year, IU relocated its medical studies program to Indianapolis. The School of Nursing opened in 1913 as the Indiana University Training School for Nurses. It had originally been a department within the IU School of Medicine, and become its own autonomous academic college in 1965. The John Herron Art Institute opened in 1902, an effort of the Art Association of Indianapolis. The Institute was the result of a large monetary gift from real estate investor John Herron, and housed both a museum and art school. In 1967, Indiana University acquired the art school and renamed it the Herron School of Art & Design. The museum operates separately as the Indianapolis Museum of Art. In addition to these early schools, both Indiana University and Purdue University had formerly operated extension centers in Indianapolis. Indiana University began offering informal extension courses in 1891, establishing its downtown Indianapolis extension center in 1916. Purdue University opened an extension center in Indianapolis during the fall of 1946 to provide a site in Indianapolis for students to begin their undergraduate studies prior to transferring to the West Lafayette main campus to complete their degrees.This section paraphrased with information from Founding Mothers: IUPUI, accessed 22 Aug 2020.

The lab provides research and intellectual support for the design, development, and implementation of innovative educational technology. The CyberLab was established in 1996 by Dr. Ali Jafari and funded by William Plater, the Executive Vice-Chancellor of IUPUI at the time. Ali Jafari, David Mills, Brian Ho, and Amy Warner was the first team at the CyberLab to start working on the development of the very first online (based on the Internet) on an Indiana University campus. The team received $160,000 from Indiana University to continue to implement Oncourse for all courses at IUPUI. Starting in 1998, Indiana University - Purdue University was the first IU campus to put all courses online. The CyberLab continued to develop and has now launched several projects, including; Sakai, ANGEL Learning, Epsilen, and the current project called CourseNetworking. ==Campus== { \"type\": \"ExternalData\", \"service\": \"geoshape\", \"ids\": \"Q1433199\", \"properties\": { \"title\": \"IUPUI\", \"description\": \"\", \"stroke\": \"#125123\", \"stroke-width\": 3, \"fill\": \"#2aaf4d\" } } thumb|Engineering Science & Technology Building The IUPUI campus covers 509 acres and is located in downtown Indianapolis along the Cultural Trail just two blocks from the Indiana State Capitol and adjacent to White River State Park (home of the Indiana State Museum and Indianapolis Zoo), Downtown Canal Walk and the Indiana Avenue cultural district.
