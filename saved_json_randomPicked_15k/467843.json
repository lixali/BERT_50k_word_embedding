It is believed to have been located around the modern-day city of Gimhae, Southern Gyeongsang province, near the mouth of the Nakdong River. Due to its geographic location, this kingdom played a dominant role in the regional affairs from the Byeonhan period onward to the end of the Gaya confederacy. ==Rise of the kingdom == Gaya confederacy (42–532 CE), founded by the King Suro, originated from the Byeonhan (also called Pyonhan, Byeon and Byeonjin) tribe, and it had 12 statelets. Byeonhan was one of the 3 Samhan, other 2 being Jinhan and Mahan. According to the Samguk Yusa, Geumgwan Kaya was made of 9 villages united by King Suro of Gaya. His wife and queen Heo Hwang-ok, whom he married in 48 AD, is believed to be from an Ayuta kingdom.\"The Relations Between Korea and India: Korean-Indian Relations in Ancient History.\" http://www.korea.net/news/issue/attach/PDF%20Format_india_2.pdf, page 3 of 9. As a confederacy of city states, Gaya rose to prosperity due to sea port trade with Japan and other states as well with land trade with China in the north. Daegaya was an important city state and sea port as part of the Gaya Confideracy, it is associated with the place the Queen Heo had first arrived in Korea from her foreign location. During this early time in the history of Gaya, several waves of migration from the north, including the earlier-extant Gojoseon, Buyeo, and the Goguryeo, arrived and integrated with existing populations and stimulated cultural and political developments. A sharp break in burial styles is found in archaeological sites dated near the late 3rd century AD, when these migrations are to have taken place. Burial forms associated with North Asian nomadic peoples, such as the burial of horses with the dead, suddenly replace earlier forms in the tombs of the elite. In addition, evidence exists indicating that earlier burials were systematically destroyed. In the early 1990s, a royal tomb complex was unearthed in Daeseong- dong, Gimhae, attributed to Geumgwan Gaya but apparently used since Byeonhan times.Cheol, S.K. (2000).

According to the Records of the Three Kingdoms, It is presumed the four countries, Sinunsin(臣雲遣支報),臣雲新國 also 忱彌多禮, 新彌國 present-day in South Jeolla Province Anra(安邪踧支濆), Sinbunhwal(臣離兒不例)臣濆活國 presumed present-day Gapyeong County and Geumgwan(拘邪秦支廉), have superior position in southern peninsula around the 3rd century. ==Religion== Centuries after Buddhism originated in India, Mahayana Buddhism arrived in China through Silk Road transmission of Buddhism in 1st century CE via Tibet, then into the Korean peninsula in the 3rd century CE during the Three Kingdoms Period from where Buddhism was transmitted to Japan. In Korea, Buddhism was adopted as the state religion by three constituent polities of the Three Kingdoms Period: first by the Goguryeo ruling tribe of Geumgwan Gaya in 372 CE, then by Silla in 528 CE, and lastly by Baekje in 552 CE. ==List of kings== In chronological order:Lee Injae, Owen Miller, Park Jinhoon, Yi Hyun-Hae, 2014, Korean History in Maps, Cambridge University Press, pp. 44-49, 52-60. * Geumgwan Gaya (lit.

Its various constituent city statelets fell one by one to Silla. After Geumgwan Gaya capitulated to Silla in 532 AD, its royal house was accepted into the Sillan aristocracyBarnes, Gina L. (2001).

(probably because by that time, a major house of Silla, of the Gyeongju Kim clan, was related to the Gaya royal house, which was Gimhae Kim clan) and given the rank of \"true bone,\" the second-highest level of the Silla bone rank system. General Kim Yu-shin of Silla (also of the Gimhae Kim clan) was a descendant of the last king of Gaya. ==Gallery== File:Gayahorsearmor.JPG|Gaya horse armour File:GayaironarmorFINAL.JPG|Gaya armour File:PressapochistaA.jpg|Gaya crown File:Duck-shaped pottery 오리형 토기.jpg|Gaya pottery ==See also== * History of Korea * List of Korean monarchs * Daegaya ==References== *Cheol, S.K.
