It is represented by the United States Navy (Department of Defense); the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Department of Commerce); and the United States Coast Guard (Department of Homeland Security). The National Ice Center is a subordinate command of the Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO). Originally known as the Navy/NOAA Joint Ice Center, which was established on December 15, 1976 in a memorandum of agreement between the U.S. Navy and NOAA, the National Ice Center was formed in 1995 when the U.S. Coast Guard became a partner. The National Ice Center produces global sea ice charts and various cryospheric GIS products. They also name and track Antarctic icebergs if greater than on its longest axis. Icebergs must be a minimum of 19 kilometers in length to be tracked by the NIC. == See also == * International Ice Patrol ==References== == External links == * National Ice Center website * Twitter account of US NIC Category:United States Coast Guard Category:National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Category:United States Navy Category:Government agencies established in 1995 Category:Ice in transportation Category:1995 establishments in the United States",
