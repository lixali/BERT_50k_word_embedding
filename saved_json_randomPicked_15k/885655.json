He is an anthropomorphized panther wearing a Panthers football jersey, No.00. On his page at the Panthers' web site, he describes his favorites snacks as \"birds like falcons and eagles and seahawks.\"Panthers' Web site He has a running rivalry with Jaxson de Ville, the mascot of the Jacksonville Jaguars (the Panthers' expansion brethren). Sir Purr also has family that occasionally joins him in games, such as Mini Meow, a younger version of Sir Purr. He caused a stir in a 1996 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers; on a Panthers punt, he jumped on the ball even though it was a live ball, turning the play into a touchback. ==References== Category:Carolina Panthers Category:National Football League mascots Category:Felid mascots",
