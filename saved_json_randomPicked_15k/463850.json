 "text": "Wasit Governorate () is a governorate in eastern Iraq, south-east of Baghdad and bordering Iran. Prior to 1976 it was known as Kut Province. Major cities include the capital Al-Kut, Al-Hai and Al-Suwaira. The governorate contains the Mesopotamian Marshes of Shuwayja, Al-Attariyah, and Hor Aldelmj. Its name comes from the Arabic word meaning \"middle,\" as the former city of Wasit lay along the Tigris about midway between Baghdad and Basra. Wasit city was abandoned after the Tigris shifted course. ==History== The ancient Sumerian city-state of Der is located near the town of Badra. The governorate experienced heavy fighting in the Iranâ€“Iraq War, specifically the Battle of the Marshes. During the Iraq spring fighting of 2004, the Mahdi Army briefly took control of the capital Kut, from April 6 to April 16, before being defeated by US forces. ==Demographics== The population is approximately 1,450,000. The majority are Shia Arabs. The marshes have traditionally been home to many Marsh Arabs. There are also Feyli Kurds in the eastern towns of Badra and Jassan. A small Lurish community exists east of Kut. As of 2007, the unemployment rate is 10% and the poverty rate 35%. ==Provincial government== *Governor: Malik Khalaf *Deputy Governor: Ahmed Abdu Salam ===Districts=== * Al-Aziziyah * Badra * Al-Hai * Kut * Numaniyah * Suwaira ==References== ==External links== *Iraq Inter-Agency Information & Analysis Unit Reports, Maps and Assessments of Iraq's Governorates from the UN Inter-Agency Information & Analysis Unit Category:Governorates of Iraq",
