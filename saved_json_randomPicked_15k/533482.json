 "text": "Cheesecake is a sweet dessert consisting of one or more layers. The main, and thickest, layer consists of a mixture of a soft, fresh cheese (typically cottage cheese, cream cheese or ricotta), eggs, and sugar. If there is a bottom layer, it most often consists of a crust or base made from crushed cookies (or digestive biscuits), graham crackers, pastry, or sometimes sponge cake. Cheesecake may be baked or unbaked (and is usually refrigerated). Cheesecake is usually sweetened with sugar and may be flavored in different ways. Vanilla, spices, lemon, chocolate, pumpkin, or other flavors may be added to the main cheese layer. Additional flavors and visual appeal may be added by topping the finished dessert with fruit, whipped cream, nuts, cookies, fruit sauce, chocolate syrup, or other ingredients. == Culinary classification == thumb|Making a crustless cheesecake (video)|285x285px Modern cheesecake is not usually classified as an actual \"cake\", despite the name (compare with Boston cream \"pie\"). Some people classify it as a torte due to the usage of many eggs, which are the sole source of leavening, as a key factor. Others find compelling evidence that it is a custard pie, based on the overall structure, with the separate crust, the soft filling, and the absence of flour.Berenbaum, Rose Levy (1988). The Cake Bible. William Morrow Cookbooks. . p. 80. Other sources identify it as a flan, or tart. == History == An ancient form of cheesecake may have been a popular dish in ancient Greece even prior to Romans' adoption of it with the conquest of Greece.Dana Bovbjerg, Jeremy Iggers, The Joy of Cheesecake, Barron's Educational Series, 1989 The earliest attested mention of a cheesecake is by the Greek physician Aegimus (5th century BCE), who wrote a book on the art of making cheesecakes (—).Callimachus, ap. Athen, xiv. p. 643, e The earliest extant cheesecake recipes are found in Cato the Elder's , which includes recipes for three cakes for religious uses: , and .Cato the Elder, De Agri Cultura, paragraphs 75 and 76. Available in English on-line at: University of Chicago: Penelope (Note: The \"leaves\" mentioned in Cato's recipe are bay leaves.) Of the three, placenta cake is the most like modern cheesecakes: having a crust that is separately prepared and baked. A more modern version called a sambocade, made with elderflower and rose water, is found in Forme of Cury, an English cookbook from 1390. On this basis, chef Heston Blumenthal has argued that cheesecake is an English invention. === The modern cheesecake === The English name cheesecake has been used only since the 15th century, and the cheesecake did not evolve into its modern form until somewhere around the 18th century. Europeans began removing yeast and adding beaten eggs to the cheesecake instead. With the overpowering yeast flavor gone, the result tasted more like a dessert treat. The early 19th-century cheesecake recipes in A New System of Domestic Cookery by Maria Rundell are made with cheese curd and fresh butter. One version is thickened with blanched almonds, eggs and cream, and the cakes may have included currants, brandy, raisin wine, nutmeg and orange flower water. Modern commercial American cream cheese was developed in 1872, when William Lawrence, from Chester, New York, while looking for a way to recreate the soft, French cheese Neufchâtel, accidentally came up with a way of making an \"unripened cheese\" that is heavier and creamier; other dairymen came up with similar creations independently.cheesecake History Modern cheesecake comes in two different types. Along with the baked cheesecake, some cheesecakes are made with uncooked cream cheese on a crumbled-cookie or graham cracker base. This type of cheesecake was invented in the United States. == National varieties == Cheesecakes can be broadly categorized into two basic types: baked and unbaked. Some do not have a crust or base. Cheesecake comes in a variety of styles based on region: === Africa === ====South Africa==== One popular variant of cheesecake in South Africa is made with whipped cream, cream cheese, gelatin for the filling, and a buttered digestive biscuit crust. It is not baked, and is sometimes made with Amarula liqueur. This variant is very similar to British cheesecake. This cheesecake is more common in British South African communities. === Asia === ====Japan==== Soufflé-style (or \"cotton\") Japanese cheesecake is made with cream cheese, butter, sugar, and eggs, and has a characteristically wobbly, airy texture, similar to chiffon cake. No-bake cheesecakes are known as rare cheesecake (Japanese: レアチーズケーキ). ====Philippines==== The most prominent version of cheesecake in the Philippines is ube cheesecake. It is made with a base of crushed graham crackers and an upper layer of cream cheese and ube halaya (mashed purple yam with milk, sugar, and butter). It can be prepared baked or simply refrigerated. Like other ube desserts in the Philippines, it is characteristically purple in color. === Europe === ====Russia==== Russian- style cheesecake (Vatrushka) is in the form of a dough ring and filled with quark or cottage cheese. === North America === ====United States==== The United States has several different recipes for cheesecake and this usually depends on the region in which the cake is baked, as well as the cultural background of the person baking it. ===== Chicago ===== Chicago-style cheesecake is a baked cream-cheese version that is firm on the outside with a soft and creamy texture on the inside. These cheesecakes are often made in a greased cake pan and are relatively fluffy in texture. The crust used with this style of cheesecake is most commonly made from shortbread that is crushed and mixed with sugar and butter. Some frozen cheesecakes are Chicago-style. =====New York===== thumb|New York–style cheesecake New York–style cheesecake uses a cream cheese base, also incorporating heavy cream or sour cream. The typical New York cheesecake is rich and has a dense, smooth, and creamy consistency.NY Cheese Cake Recipe & Video – Joyofbaking.com *Video Recipe* ==Galleries== === Cheesecakes from around the world === File:Bavarian- Cheesecake.png|Bavarian baked cheesecake File:Quarktorte.jpg|Dutch cheesecake (kwarktaart) File:Tarte au fromage blanc.png|French cheesecake (tarte au fromage) File:Oberkrämer 23.05.2015 13-21-03.JPG|German cheesecake (Käsekuchen) File:Plăcintă cu brânză.jpg|Romanian cheesecake File:Carnegie Deli Strawberry Cheesecake.jpg|New York–style cheesecake with strawberries File:Japanese no-bake cheesecake.jpg|Japanese no-bake cheesecake with strawberry sauce === Fruit cheesecakes === File:Blueberry rare cheesecake.jpg|Blueberry and mixed-fruit cheesecake File:Cheesecake mit Beeren.jpg|New York–style cheesecake with berries File:Orange cheesecake.jpg|No-bake cheesecake with orange jelly File:Manga Basil Cheese Cake with Mango Ravioli3.jpg|Cheesecake with mango File:Lemon Cheesecake Fontanella Tea Garden.jpg|Lemon cheesecake File:Raw Strawberry Shortcake at Loving Hut Vegan Restaurant.jpg|Raw-food strawberry cheesecake == See also == * List of desserts * List of pies, tarts and flans * List of Kuih, Southeast Asian sweets == References == Category:Ancient Greek cuisine Category:Articles containing video clips Category:British cakes Category:Custard desserts Category:English cuisine Category:Jewish baked goods Category:German cakes Category:Israeli cuisine Category:Types of food Category:World cuisine Category:Cheesecakes Category:American cakes",
