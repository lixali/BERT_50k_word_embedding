 "text": "The Kingsbridge Road station is a local station on the elevated IRT Jerome Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Kingsbridge Road and Jerome Avenue in Kingsbridge Heights, Bronx, it is served by the 4 train at all times. This station was constructed by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company as part of the Dual Contracts and opened in 1917. == History == ===Construction and opening=== The Dual Contracts, which were signed on March 19, 1913, were contracts for the construction and/or rehabilitation and operation of rapid transit lines in the City of New York. The contracts were \"dual\" in that they were signed between the City and two separate private companies (the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company), all working together to make the construction of the Dual Contracts possible. The Dual Contracts promised the construction of several lines in the Bronx. As part of Contract 3, the IRT agreed to build an elevated line along Jerome Avenue in the Bronx. Kingsbridge Road station opened as the northern terminal of the initial section of the line on June 2, 1917. Service was initially operated as a shuttle between Kingsbridge Road and 149th Street, and only the southbound platform was in use at this station. Through service to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line began on July 17, 1918. This station ceased to be the terminal of the line with the opening of the final extension to Woodlawn on April 15, 1918. This section was initially served by shuttle service, with passengers transferring at 167th Street. The construction of the line encouraged development along Jerome Avenue, and led to the growth of the surrounding communities. ===Later years=== In May 2018, New York City Transit Authority President Andy Byford announced his plan subway and bus modernization plan, known as Fast Forward, which included making an additional 50 stations compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 during the 2020–2024 Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) Capital Program to allow most riders to have an accessible station every two or three stops. The draft 2020–2024 Capital Program released in September 2019 included 66 stations that would receive ADA improvements. In December, the MTA announced that an additional twenty stations, including Kingsbridge Road, would be made ADA-accessible as part of the Capital Program. ==Station layout== The station has three tracks and two side platforms. The 4 stops here at all times. The middle track is generally not used in revenue service. It is a typical IRT elevated station.
