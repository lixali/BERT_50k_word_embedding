 "text": "Zap Comix is an underground comix series which was originally part of the youth counterculture of the late 1960s. While a few small-circulation self- published satirical comic books had been printed prior to this, Zap became the model for the \"comix\" movement that snowballed after its release. The title itself published 17 issues over a period of 46 years. Premiering in early 1968 as a showcase for the work of Robert Crumb, Zap was unlike any comic book sensibility that had been seen before. After the success of the first issue, Crumb opened the pages of Zap to several other artists, including S. Clay Wilson, Robert Williams, \"Spain\" Rodriguez, Gilbert Shelton, and two artists with reputations as psychedelic poster designers, Victor Moscoso and Rick Griffin. This stable of artists, along with Crumb, remained mostly constant throughout the history of Zap. While the origin of the spelling \"comix\" is a subject of some dispute, it was popularized by its appearance in the title of the first issues of Zap. Design critic Steven Heller claims that the term \"comix\" (\"co-mix\") refers to the traditional comic book style of Zap, and its mixture of dirty jokes and storylines.Heller, Steven. 1999. Design Literacy: Understanding Graphic Design, New York: Allworth Press. == Overview == Labeled \"Fair Warning: For Adult Intellectuals Only\", Zap #1 featured the publishing debut of Robert Crumb's much-bootlegged Keep on Truckin' imagery, an early appearance of unreliable holy man Mr. Natural and his neurotic disciple Flakey Foont, and the first of innumerable self-caricatures (in which Crumb calls himself \"a raving lunatic\", and \"one of the world's last great medieval thinkers\"). The debut issue included the story \"Whiteman,\" which detailed the inner torment seething within the lusty, fearful heart of an outwardly upright American. For the second issue, Crumb invited S. Clay Wilson, Victor Moscoso and Rick Griffin to contribute. Gilbert Shelton joined the crew with issue #3, and Robert Wiliams and Spain Rodriguez joined with issue #4, completing the roster. Zap's new publisher the Print Mint weathered a lawsuit filed over the Zap #4, released in 1969, which featured among other things, Crumb's depiction of incest in a middle-class family. The publishers, Don & Alice Schenker, were arrested and charged with publishing pornography by the Berkeley Police Department. Previous to that, Simon Lowinsky, who had a gallery on College Avenue in Berkeley and had put up an exhibition of the Crumb's original drawings, had been arrested on the same charge. His case came to trial first. He was acquittedGilbert Shelton quoted in ROSENKRANZ, PATRICK. \"Zap: Censorship and Suppression,\" The Comics Journal website (NOV 10, 2014): \"Over in Berkeley there was Si [Simon] Lowinsky who had an art gallery and he had an exhibition, and was selling copies of Snatch Comics and he got busted for that. It went to court. It went to trial. The definition of pornography in California is that it has to be of prurient interest and no one on the jury would admit to being aroused by Snatch Comics. It got a not guilty verdict.\" after supportive testimony from Peter Selz, a prominent figure in the art world. At that point the city dropped the charges against the Print Mint. In a related case, however — also brought on by Zap #4 — the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1973 that local communities could decide their own First Amendment standards with reference to obscenity.Sergi, Joe. \"Obscenity Case Files: People of New York v. Kirkpatrick (Zap Comix #4),\" Comic Book Legal Defense Fund website.Accessed Nov. 17, 2016. (See Miller v. California) In the mid-1970s, sale of drug paraphernalia was outlawed in many places, and the distribution network for these comics (and the underground newspapers) dried up, leaving mail order as the only commercial outlet for underground titles.Estren, Mark James (1993). \"Foreword: Onward!\". A History of Underground Comics. Ronin Publishing. p. 7. . Contributor Rick Griffin died in 1991; Paul Mavrides made his debut as a Zap contributor in issue #14 (1998). (Mavrides was invited to contribute when Crumb announced that he no longer wanted to work on Zap — although Crumb never did actually quit the title.)Fox, M. Steven. \"Zap Comix #14,\" ComixJoint. Accessed Nov. 19, 2016. ==Publication history== Zap #1 was published in San Francisco in early 1968. Some 3,500 copies were printed by Beat writer Charles Plymell,Zap Comix entry at the Grand Comics Database.

The contents of the first Zap were not intended to be the debut issue. Philadelphia publisher Brian Zahn (who had published earlier works of R. Crumb in his Philadelphia-based underground newspaper Yarrowstalks)Heritage Comics and Comic Art Signature Auction #823 By Ivy Press, Gary Dowell, Greg Holman had intended to publish an earlier version of the comic, but reportedly left the country with the artwork. Rather than repeat himself, Crumb drew a new assortment of strips, which replaced the missing issue. (The tagline of Zap #1, \"Zap Comics are Squinky Comics!!\" has an interesting origin. Art Spiegelman called his girlfriend of the time, Isabella Fiske, \"Squink.\" Crumb liked the word and decided to use it on the cover. Crumb himself creditsCrumb, Robert. \"Minds are Made to Be Blown,\" The Complete Crumb Comics - Volume 4 (Fantagraphics, 1988). Archived on CrumbProducts.com.

In late 1968, shortly before Zap #3 was to be published, Crumb found Xerox copies of the missing pages from the original Zap #1, which (according to fellow Zap contributor Victor Moscoso) successfully captured the linework but not the solid blacks. After being re-inked by Crumb, those strips subsequently appeared as Zap #0. Thus Zap #0 became the third in the series (even though it was drawn before #1 in 1967), and Zap #3 the fourth.Estren, Mark, A History of Underground Comics, Ronin Publishing, 1993 , 9780914171645 p.52 With issue #4 (Aug. 1969), Zap moved publishers to the Print Mint, which weathered a lawsuit related to its contents (see above). A 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling led to the collapse of the underground comix market, and after that Zap was published sporadically, with it being typical for three to five years to pass between new issues. Zap continued to be published by Print Mint through issue #9 (1978), when the company stopped publishing comics altogether. From issue #10 (1982) onward, Zap was published by Last Gasp (which also published many reprints of earlier issues). Again, there were often long periods between issues: altogether, five issues of Zap were published (by Print Mint and Last Gasp) in the 1970s, three issues in the 1980s, and two issues in the 1990s. Zap #15 () came out in 2005, seven years after the previous issue. Issues #13–15 all featured cameos by sex-positive feminist Susie Bright as a character within its pages (or on the cover). A limited edition six-volume hardcover box set containing the complete Zap Comix () was published by Fantagraphics in November 2014.Heller, Steve. \"Comics for the Youth Movement, Not for Kids: A new history of Zap Comix celebrates how the lascivious, tongue-in-cheek cartoons revolted against conservative Cold War-era mores,\" The Atlantic (Nov. 20, 2014).

The Art of the Comic Book: An Aesthetic History. University Press of Mississippi, p. 195. . In years to come, the comic's sales would be most closely linked with alternative venues such as head shops. Due to its unusual outside position in the comic distribution industry, a completely accurate count of Zap's circulation cannot be known, but overall sales for the comic's first 16 issues are in the millions. == Jams == From issue #3 forward (with the exception of issue #8), every issue of the title featured a group jam by the \"Zap collective,\" where the cartoonists would pass a story around, each one contributing panels to the overall story (which was usually no more than two pages). In addition, in June 1970, the collective did the one-page jam \"Science Fiction Comics\" along with Harvey Kurtzman, which was published in East Village Other vol. 6, #1. In 1974, between issues #7 and #8 of Zap Comix, the collective produced Zam (Zap Jam), an entire 36-page comic filled with their jams. === List of Zap jams === * \"Atomic Comics,\" 3 pages in Zap #3 * \"Jam,\" 3 pages in Zap #4 * \"Micro-Minnie,\" .15 page in Zap #5 * \"Mammy Jama,\" 1 page in Zap #6 * [\"All nite comix...\"], 2 pages in Zam-Zap Jam (The Print Mint, 1974) * \"Zyklon Jam - Souvenir of the Carnage,\" 1 page in Zap #8 * \"The Sky Is, In Fact, Falling\" (\"Four Guys Comics\"), 1 page in Zap #9 * \"Toe Jam Comix,\" 1 page in Zap #10 * \"The Constipated Chaos Consortium,\" 1 page in Zap #11 * \"Rotten to the Core,\" 2 pages in Zap #12 * \"Bark All You Want, You Can't Bite Me Now — A Shaggy Fish Story,\" 3 pages in Zap #13 * \"The Last Lunch,\" 2 pages in Zap #13 — dedicated to the memory of Rick Griffin * \"(Self) Important Comics,\" 2 pages in Zap #14 * \"Circle of Jerks,\" 2 pages in Zap #15 ==Featured characters== *Angelfood McSpade (R.
