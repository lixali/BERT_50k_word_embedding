It voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in every election the state's admission into the union in 1912 to 1996, being one of only seven Mountain State counties to support George McGovern in his landslide defeat against Republican Richard Nixon in the 1972 Presidential Election. Even Ronald Reagan was unable to win it in his 49 state landslide in 1984, however, in 2000, George W. Bush became the first Republican presidential candidate to win the county, and has it has voted for the Republican nominee in the 5 elections since, giving Donald Trump 66% of the vote in 2020. The county's turn to the GOP can likely be explained by the Democratic Party's anti-mining platform, as Greenlee's economy is heavily dependent on copper mining, with Bush's 2000 opponent, Vice President Al Gore being staunchly against coal mining. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; float:right; font-size:95%;\" |+ Greenlee County vote by party in presidential electionsScammon, Richard M.
