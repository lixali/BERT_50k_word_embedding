 "text": "Bentley Rhythm Ace (BRA) are a British electronic music duo formed in Birmingham in 1995, consisting of Mike Stokes and Richard March. ==Career== The band was formed in Birmingham by Richard March, formerly with the group Pop Will Eat Itself, and Mike Stokes formerly with Bugweed Centipede, with guest appearances by James Atkin, a member of indie band EMF. \"Both more or less penniless, they drank in the same pub and were forced to buy their records at the cheapest place possible - car boot sales\". Their live drummers include Keith York and Car SOS's Fuzz Townshend (alongside whom March previously played with in Pop Will Eat Itself), while EMF's James Atkin is also involved with BRA as a touring member. BRA signed on the Brighton based record label Skint and released their eponymous debut album, Bentley Rhythm Ace in 1997, which spawned the popular single \"Bentleys Gonna Sort You Out!\". A second album, For Your Ears Only, was released in 2000 on Parlophone but was less popular. A further single \"Madam, Your Carriage Awaits\" was released. The group also compiled a two CD FSUK compilation album. In 2004, the Bentleys released a 4-song record with Sophia Lolley called Angel Face. The name probably refers to the Rhythm Ace line of analogue drum machines manufactured by Ace Tone, some of which were rebranded and distributed by Bentley Pianos in the UK.ACE-TONE ARCHIVE PAGE retrieved 2 April 2006. The group epitomises the big beat era. Signed to Skint Records, they enjoyed commercial success with their music being used on television advertisements and having an underground following. The group split in 2000 after which they played the occasional low- key DJ set. In 2016, the duo reformed and played live sets across the UK at festivals, supporting The Wonder Stuff's December tour and headlining a few of their own shows. Michael Barrie Whoosh released a new LP in December 2021 entitled \"cant remember where i left myself\". ==Discography== ===Albums=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year !! Album !! UK !!
