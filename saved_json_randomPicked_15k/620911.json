 "text": "Pet Your Friends is the debut album by American alternative rock band Dishwalla. It was released in 1995 on A&M; Records. The album produced the hit single \"Counting Blue Cars\" (the third single off the album and only one to gain widespread success), which was a Top 40 favorite. However, the song also caused the group to gain somewhat of a one-hit wonder status because of it. Still, the album's fourth single, \"Charlie Brown's Parents\", was quite popular at concerts, although it was not a very successful single in terms of sales. An acoustic version of \"Counting Blue Cars\" which featured an extended bridge was also popular on radio. The image used for the cover of the album is taken from the August 23, 1948 Life Magazine cover. The cover story talks about a seventeen-year-old girl who became friends with a friend's pet deer while swimming one day.\"Bucky the Deer.\" Life. p. 53. 23 August 1948. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ;Dishwalla * J.R.
