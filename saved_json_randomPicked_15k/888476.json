 "text": "The Temerty Faculty of Medicine (previously Faculty of Medicine) is the medical school of the University of Toronto. Founded in 1843, the faculty is based in Downtown Toronto and is one of Canada's oldest institutions of medical studies, being known for the discovery of insulin, stem cells and the site of the first single and double lung transplants in the world. ==History== The university originally opened its medical school in 1843, providing instruction in medicine and medical sciences. In 1853, it suspended the school's teaching program and transferred teaching duties to the city's three proprietary schools: Trinity Medical College, the Toronto School of Medicine and Woman's Medical College. Because proprietary schools could not grant degrees, the university's medical school retained the responsibility of holding examinations and conferring medical degrees. As the university kept raising its standards, the medical examinations became increasingly rigorous and scientific. This led to fewer medical students from proprietary schools deciding to obtain university degrees, which were not required for medical practice at the time. left|thumb|Recruitment ad from 1906, showing course fees, subjects and other information. In 1887, the university resumed medical teaching in its Faculty of Medicine. The faculty promptly absorbed the Toronto School of Medicine, which could no longer compete with the university as it faced heavy costs of scientific work and higher examination standards set by the faculty. The Faculty, in partnership with the University of Toronto Mississauga and Trillium Health Partners opened the Mississauga Academy of Medicine in August 2011 with 54 first-year students. As of 2014, the academy has a total of 216 students enrolled in the four-year program. The new facility is located across two floors inside the new Terrence Donnelly Health Sciences Complex and provides brand new classrooms, seminar rooms, computer facilities, learning spaces and laboratories. Students are provided with fully equipped student lounge and outdoor terrace to relax and socialize. Students are able to share lectures and learning experiences both inside and outside the classroom through advanced technologies. ==Curriculum== thumb|The Medical Sciences Building is the administrative centre of the Faculty of Medicine thumb|The McMurrich Building contains offices of medical faculty members and researchers. In 2016, the Faculty of Medicine implemented the new Foundations Curriculum, moving away from the traditional lecture based style of teaching based on anatomy, physiology, pathology and pharmacology and into a case-based learning approach with early clinical exposure. The Doctor of Medicine program at the University of Toronto is a 4-year MD program with a total enrollment of about 850 students. The first two years are known as the preclerkship curriculum, during which M.D. candidates acquire the basic biomedical and human anatomy knowledge. The principles of medical ethics, professionalism and medical jurisprudence are also taught in preclerkship. The final two years form the clerkship curriculum that takes place in hospitals and ambulatory clinics. The core clerkship rotations cover the essential medical specialties: surgery and internal medicine, psychiatry, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, family medicine, ambulatory experience, neurology, emergency medicine, anesthesia, ophthalmology, otolaryngology and dermatology. Additional rotations are devoted to elective clerkships that provide training in subdisciplines within the major specialities. In 2018, the average accepted undergraduate weighted GPA was 3.96 (on the University of Toronto Weighted GPA (wGPA) Formula) and the median score in the numerically graded sections of the MCAT was 11.Henheffer, Tom. \"Canadaâ€™s Best Professional Schools: Where did you go, Marcus Welby?\". Macleans. September 17, 2009 The University of Toronto is one of only a few programs in Canada to accept international students through its admission process. The faculty also offers the MD/PhD degree jointly with University of Toronto doctoral programs, in addition to other degrees of Master of Science, master of public health, master of health science, doctor of philosophy, and post-doctoral fellowships. ==Departments, hospitals and research== The Faculty of Medicine is subdivided into 26 separate departments: Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Biochemistry, Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research, Family and Community Medicine, Immunology, Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, Medical Biophysics, Medical Imaging, the Institute of Medical Science, Medicine, Molecular Genetics, Nutritional Sciences, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy, Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences, Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, Paediatrics, Pharmacology and Toxicology, Physical Therapy, Physiology, Psychiatry, Radiation Oncology, Rehabilitation Sciences Institute, Speech-Language Pathology and Surgery. The Faculty of Medicine is also the only medical school in the Greater Toronto Area and operates a health network that comprises twelve teaching hospitals with significant emphasis on tertiary care, including medical treatment, research and advisory services to patients and clients from Canada and abroad. The Faculty houses Biosafety level 3 facilities. The faculty is associated with two level 1 adult trauma centres, a multi-organ transplant hospital, a pediatric hospital, a psychiatric hospital, a geriatric hospital, four rehabilitation institutes and several general hospitals. The teaching hospitals are arranged in four hospital networks, which are the University Health Network, Unity Health Toronto, the Sinai Health System, the Trillium Health Partners, as well as three major teaching hospitals outside of the system, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Women's College Hospital and The Hospital for Sick Children. *The University Health Network consists of three specialized hospitals: Toronto General Hospital for cardiology and organ transplants; Princess Margaret Cancer Centre for oncology as the home of the Ontario Cancer Institute; and Toronto Western Hospital for neuroscience and musculoskeletal health.; ; *Unity Health Toronto consists of St Michael's Hospital, an adult hospital and trauma center, Providence Healthcare, a rehabilitation institute and St. Joseph's Health Centre, a community teaching hospital. *Sinai Health System consists of Mount Sinai Hospital, a general hospital and Bridgepoint Active Healthcare, a rehabilitation institute. *Trillium Health Partners consists of Mississauga Hospital, a general hospital, Credit Valley Hospital, community teaching hospital, *Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre is an adult hospital with regional cancer and trauma centres. *Women's College Hospital is an ambulatory hospital focused on women's health. *The Hospital for Sick Children is the pediatric medical centre specializing in treatments for childhood diseases and injuries. Rotations may also involve community teaching hospitals, which include North York General Hospital, St. Joseph's Health Centre, Michael Garron Hospital, Scarborough General Hospital, Credit Valley Hospital and Markham Stouffville Hospital. MaRS Discovery District is an affiliated corporation that was established to help commercialize the faculty's life science and medical research through partnerships with private enterprises. {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |+University of Toronto fully affiliated teaching hospitals |- !
