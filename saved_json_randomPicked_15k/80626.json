Their ubiquitous yet invisible presence behind the scenes requires concentration, for to understand what they did demands a shift in focus, like watching the black and white striped referees in a football game, rather than the players competing and scoring. Accordingly, demiourgoi alone demonstrate declining status,Bjorn Qviller \"Homeric Demiourgoi,\" Symbolae Osloenses 55 (1980): 5–21. hence the heraldic office itself declined in sanctity and authority,Robert Mondi The Function and Social Position of the Kerux in Early Greece, PhD Harvard University 1978: 1, 87, 116–117. even though its exalted status survived in archaic Athens.Wm. Vocke The Athenian Heralds, PhD University of Cincinnati 1970. Two of the most prominent kerykes were the Spartan herald Talthybios, and the Trojan herald Idaios, both being spear-carriers;Homer Iliad 7.281. they were known by the epithet pepnumenō.\"awesome\". Homer Iliad 7.274. By the archaic period 700-650 BC, HesiodHesiod Theogony 938, Works and Days 80. identifies Hermes with the herald of the Olympian gods that has special control over the daimonic winged Keres in-flight into and out of Demeter Pandora, personified wine-storage jars blamed for all of the ills of humans, where only Hope lingered at the rim. She was Demeter Anesidora, one aspect of the grain-goddess at Athens who preceded the revenge-filled Demeter Erinys 'at Eleusis.The Homeric Hymn to Demeter (147) names her Maia, also the mother of Hermes Kêryx. The burial spot of herald AnthemokritosPausanias Description of Greece 1.36.3 helps identify the larger grave-mound of the Athenian Kerykes with the massive Tomb 9 along the Eridanos River outside the Dipylon Gate.Ursula Knigge The Athenian Kerameikos (1991) pp. 94–98. By the classical period, the Kerykes, sons of Hermes, were one of the sacred Eleusinian families of priests that ran the Eleusinian Mysteries. They popularized the cult and allowed many more to be initiated into the great secrets of Demeter and Persephone, including the concoction kukeion, or kykeon. Starting about 300 BC, the state took over control of the Mysteries, specifically controlled by two families: the Eumolpidae and the Kerykes. This led to a vast increase in the number of initiates. The only requirements for membership were a lack of \"blood guilt\" (meaning having never committed murder) and not a barbarian (i.e. Greek and able to speak Greek). Men, women and even slaves were allowed to be initiated. Kerykes (which means \"heralds\" in Greek), were also part of the ritual and competitors at the Olympic Games (see Herald and Trumpet contest). ==See also== *Keryx, herald in mythology *List of Mycenaean deities *\"The Common Voice of the People\" - A book length PhD study on heralds in Ancient Greece. ==References== Category:Eleusinian hierophants",
