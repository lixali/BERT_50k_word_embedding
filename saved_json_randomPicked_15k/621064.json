 "text": "Free Kitten is an American alternative rock band formed by Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon and Pussy Galore's Julie Cafritz. Originally performing as Kitten, they changed their name after receiving threats of legal action by a heavy metal singer performing under the same name. Boredoms member Yoshimi P-We took up drums, and Pavement's Mark Ibold joined later on as bassist. They have released a handful of albums and singles, mainly on label Kill Rock Stars, including a remix 12\" featuring DJ Spooky. They toured on 1993's Lollapalooza. A studio album, 2008's Inherit, on Thurston Moore's Ecstatic Peace label, is the group's most recently available. ==Discography== ===Albums=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |Title |Release Date |Label |- |Unboxed |1994 |Wiiija |- |Nice Ass |1995 |Kill Rock Stars |- |Sentimental Education |1997 |Kill Rock Stars |- |Inherit |2008 |Ecstatic Peace |- |} ===EPs=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |Title |Release Date |Label |- |Straight Up (as Kitten) |1992 |Pearl Necklace |- |Call Now |1992 |Ecstatic Peace |- |Punks Suing Punks |1996 |Kill Rock Stars |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Title !Label |- | 1992 | \"Yoshimi Vs.
