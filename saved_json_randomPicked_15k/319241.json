High taxes and high unemployment brought a return to high net emigration, a long-established Irish flow which had temporarily reversed in the 1970s. An economic policy document, \"Building on reality\", was published in 1984. The \"republican crusade\" flagged by Garret Fitzgerald in 1981 saw some changes in policy on Northern Ireland and social issues. The government's New Ireland Forum was a prelude to the Anglo-Irish Agreement signed in 1985. A referendum to ease the ban on divorce was defeated in 1986, while a bill to ease restrictions on contraception, was passed in 1985. The failure of Desmond O'Malley to vote against this legislation led to his expulsion from Fianna Fáil. O'Malley later established the Progressive Democrats in December 1985. ==See also== *Dáil Éireann *Constitution of Ireland *Politics of the Republic of Ireland ==References== Category:1982 establishments in Ireland Category:1987 disestablishments in Ireland Category:24th Dáil Category:Cabinets established in 1982 Category:Cabinets disestablished in 1987 Category:Coalition governments of Ireland Category:Governments of Ireland",
