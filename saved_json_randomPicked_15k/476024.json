 "text": "The NAACP Image Awards is an annual awards ceremony presented by the U.S.-based National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to honor outstanding performances in film, television, theatre, music, and literature. Similar to other awards, like the Oscars and the Grammys, the over 40 categories of the Image Awards are voted on by the award organization's members (in this case, NAACP members). Honorary awards (similar to the Academy Honorary Award) have also been included, such as the President's Award, the Chairman's Award, the Entertainer of the Year, and the Hall of Fame Award. ==History== The award ceremony was first organized and presented on August 13, 1967, by activists Maggie Hathaway, Sammy Davis, Jr. and Willis Edwards, all three of whom were leaders of the Beverly Hills-Hollywood NAACP branch. While it was first taped for television by NBC (which broadcast the awards from 1987 to 1994 in January, on weeks when Saturday Night Live wasn't airing a new episode), it would only be broadcast in primetime beginning in 1996. There was no awards ceremony in 1973 or 1995. The first live broadcast of the awards, also on the Fox Network, occurred in 2007 for its 38th edition (up until 2007, the ceremony had been broadcast with tape delay) and the annual ceremonies usually take place in or around the Los Angeles area, in February or early March. The 44th edition aired on NBC. Sources have had trouble verifying the winners in the top categories from 1983 to 1995. The New York firm Society Awards manufactures the trophy since its redesign in 2008. ===Event dates and locations=== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! # ! Date ! Host(s) !

They defended this position, citing a lack of meaningful roles for black women. In 1990, they were criticized once again for not awarding Best Actress. This was the fourth time it could not find enough nominees for Best Actress. Sandra Evers-Manly, president of the organization's Beverly Hills/Hollywood branch, said, \"The [film] industry has yet to show diversity or present realistic leading roles for African-American women.\" In other years, some nominees have been called undeserving of NAACP attention. In response, some NAACP representatives have argued that the quality of an artist's work is the salient issue, with factors such as criminal charges inconsequential in this regard. For example, in 1994, Tupac Shakur was a nominee for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture for the film Poetic Justice despite the filing of sexual assault charges against him in December 1993. More specifically, Shakur had been accused of felony counts of forcible sodomy and unlawful detainment in New York City, when a woman alleged that he and two other men held her down in a hotel room while a fourth man sodomized her. Shakur was also indicted for two counts of aggravated assault in an unrelated incident in which he supposedly shot and wounded two off-duty police officers. In the same year, Martin Lawrence was criticized for winning Outstanding Actor in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Comedy Series and the show was criticized for its sexual controversy. In 2004, R. Kelly's Chocolate Factory was nominated for Outstanding Album while he was under indictment for charges related to child pornography. Other nominees have faced controversy due to their portrayals of major civil rights figures. In 2003, the movie Barbershop received five nominations, including Outstanding Motion Picture and Outstanding Supporting Actor (for Cedric the Entertainer's performance). In the film, Cedric's character makes pejorative remarks about Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King, Jr., Michael Jackson, and Jesse Jackson, content that elicited criticism, including Rosa Parks's refusal to attend the awards event. The rap group OutKast received six nominations in 2004 but faced criticism because they had previously recorded the song \"Rosa Parks\", which had resulted in Parks suing them over the use of her name. ==Award categories== These are the major categories: ===Motion picture=== * Outstanding Motion Picture * Outstanding Documentary * Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture * Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture * Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture * Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture * Outstanding International Motion Picture * Outstanding Independent Motion Picture * Outstanding Directing in a Motion Picture * Outstanding Writing in a Motion Picture * Outstanding Character Voice Performance – Motion Picture ===Music=== * Outstanding New Artist * Outstanding Female Artist * Outstanding Male Artist * Outstanding Duo or Group * Outstanding Jazz Artist * Outstanding Jazz Album * Outstanding Gospel Artist * Outstanding Gospel Album (Traditional or Contemporary) * Outstanding Music Video * Outstanding Song (Traditional and Contemporary) * Outstanding Album ===Literature=== * Outstanding Literary Work – Fiction * Outstanding Literary Work – Nonfiction * Outstanding Literary Work – Biography/Autobiography * Outstanding Literary Work – Debut Author * Outstanding Literary Work – Poetry * Outstanding Literary Work – Instructional * Outstanding Literary Work – Children * Outstanding Literary Work – Youth/Teens ===Podcast=== * Outstanding News and Information Podcast * Outstanding Lifestyle/Self-Help Podcast * Outstanding Society and Culture Podcast * Outstanding Literary Work – Debut Author * Outstanding Arts and Entertainment Podcast ===Television=== * Outstanding Drama Series * Outstanding Actress in a Drama Series * Outstanding Actor in a Drama Series * Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series * Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series * Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series * Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series * Outstanding Children's Program * Outstanding Comedy Series * Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series * Outstanding Actor in a Comedy Series * Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series * Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series * Outstanding Actress in a Daytime Drama Series * Outstanding Actor in a Daytime Drama Series * Outstanding Television Movie, Mini-Series or Dramatic Special * Outstanding Actress in a Television Movie, Mini-Series or Dramatic Special * Outstanding Actor in a Television Movie, Mini-Series or Dramatic Special * Outstanding Performance by a Youth (Series, Special, Television Movie or Limited-series) * Outstanding News/Information – Series or Special * Outstanding Talk Series * Outstanding Variety – Series or Special * Outstanding Character Voice-Over Performance (Television) ===Special awards=== * Vanguard Award * Chairman's Award * President's Award * Hall of Fame Award * Entertainer of the Year * Social Media Personality of the Year ==References== ==External links== * * The Futon Critic Category:Awards established in 1967 Category:Awards honoring African Americans Category:1969 establishments in the United States",
