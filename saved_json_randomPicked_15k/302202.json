 "text": "In mathematics, and more specifically in abstract algebra, an element x of a *-algebra is self-adjoint (or Hermitian) if x^*=x. A collection C of elements of a star-algebra is self-adjoint if it is closed under the involution operation. For example, if x^*=y then since y^*=x^{**}=x in a star-algebra, the set {x,y} is a self-adjoint set even though x and y need not be self- adjoint elements. In functional analysis, a linear operator A : H \\to H on a Hilbert space is called self-adjoint if it is equal to its own adjoint A. See self-adjoint operator for a detailed discussion. If the Hilbert space is finite-dimensional and an orthonormal basis has been chosen, then the operator A is self-adjoint if and only if the matrix describing A with respect to this basis is Hermitian, i.e. if it is equal to its own conjugate transpose. Hermitian matrices are also called self-adjoint. In a dagger category, a morphism f is called self-adjoint if f=f^\\dagger; this is possible only for an endomorphism f\\colon a \\to a. ==See also== * Hermitian matrix * Normal element * Symmetric matrix * Self-adjoint operator * Unitary element == References == * * Category:Abstract algebra Category:Linear algebra",
