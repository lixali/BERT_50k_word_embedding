 "text": "Coracias is a genus of the rollers, an Old World family of near passerine birds related to the kingfishers and bee-eaters. They share the colourful appearance of those groups, blues and browns predominating. The two outer front toes are connected, but not the inner one. ==Taxonomy== The genus Coracias was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae. The genus name is from Ancient Greek korakías (), derived from korax (, ‘raven, crow’). Aristotle described the coracias as a bird as big as a crow with a red beak, which some believe to be the chough.Greek Word Study Tool The type species was designated as the European roller (Coracias garrulus) by George Robert Gray in 1855. The phylogenetic relationships among the species were determined in a molecular study published in 2018. ===Species=== Nine species are recognized: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Image !! Common Name !! Scientific name !! Distribution |- |120px || Purple roller ||Coracias naevius || sub-Saharan Africa |- |120px || Indian roller ||Coracias benghalensis || Western Asia to Indian Subcontinent |- |120px || Indochinese roller ||Coracias affinis || eastern India to southeast Asia |- |120px || Purple-winged roller ||Coracias temminckii ||Islands of Sulawesi, Bangka, Lembeh, Manterawu, Muna and Butung. |- |120px || Racket-tailed roller ||Coracias spatulatus ||southern Africa from Angola, south-eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and southern Tanzania to northern Botswana, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique |- |120px || Lilac-breasted roller ||Coracias caudatus || sub-Saharan Africa and the southern Arabian Peninsula |- |120px || Abyssinian roller ||Coracias abyssinicus || tropical Africa in a belt south of the Sahara, known as the Sahel |- |120px || European roller ||Coracias garrulus || Middle East, Central Asia, Mediterranean and eastern Europe. |- |120px || Blue-bellied roller ||Coracias cyanogaster ||Senegal to northeast Democratic Republic of the Congo |- |} ===Former species=== Formerly, some authorities also considered the following species (or subspecies) as species within the genus Coracias: * Olive-backed oriole (as Coracias sagittata) * Eurasian golden oriole (as Coracias oriolus) * Black-hooded oriole (as Coracias xanthornus) * Broad-billed roller (as Coracias glaucurus) * Broad-billed roller (afer) (as Coracias afra) * Oriental dollarbird (as Coracias orientalis) * Australian roller (as Coracias pacifica) ==Behaviour and ecology== Coracias rollers are watch-and wait hunters. They sit in a tree or on a post before descending on their prey and carrying it back in the beak to a perch before dismembering it. A wide range of terrestrial invertebrates, and small vertebrates such as frogs, lizards rodents and young birds, are taken. Their prey includes items avoided by many other birds, such as hairy caterpillars, insects with warning colouration and snakes. They often perch prominently whilst hunting, like giant shrikes. ==References== ==External links== *Roller videos on the Internet Bird Collection Category:Coraciidae Category:Bird genera Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus",
