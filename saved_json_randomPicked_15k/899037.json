 "text": "Sussex Golden Ginger Ale is a \"golden\" ginger ale originally bottled in the town of Sussex, New Brunswick, Canada. It is produced by Canada Dry Motts, a subsidiary of the Dr Pepper Snapple Group. The beverage is retailed in Canada's Maritime Provinces and northern areas in the state of Maine. Ginger ales generally come in two varieties: golden ginger ale; which is dark-colored and more strongly flavoured; and dry ginger ale, which is more common today. Dry ginger ale was developed during Prohibition when ginger ale was used as a mixer for alcoholic beverages, which made the stronger flavour of the golden variety undesirable. Dry ginger ale quickly became more popular than golden, and today golden ginger ales like Sussex are an uncommon and usually a regional drink. == Variants == Other soft drinks with the Sussex name have been Sussex Pale Dry Ginger Ale, Sussex Red Oval Ginger Ale, Sussex Old English Ginger Beer and Sussex Cola. == Brand ownership == The brand has had various owners, including Sussex Mineral Spring Co., Sussex Ginger Ale Ltd., Maritime Beverages Ltd., Great Pacific Industries Inc., Canadian 7up, and Crush Canada Inc. Sussex Golden Ginger Ale is now owned by the Dr Pepper Snapple Group (formerly Cadbury Beverages Canada Inc.). == See also == *Cadbury-Schweppes *Canada Dry *Vernors == External links == * Info on Sussex Ginger Ale label and bottle design at bottlebooks.com * Cadbury-Schweppes Official Webpage * Schweppes Canada Official Webpage * Schweppes US Official Webpage * Picture of Sussex Old English Ginger Beer Bottle c.1911 (archived page from the internet archive) * Picture of Sussex Old English Ginger Beer Bottle Category:Canadian drinks Category:Culture of New Brunswick Category:Defunct companies of New Brunswick Category:Keurig Dr Pepper brands Category:Ginger ale Category:Cuisine of New Brunswick",
