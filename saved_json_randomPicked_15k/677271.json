The class was also one of a series called within the Imperial Japanese Navy from their plan name. At the time of introduction, these destroyers were among the deadliest destroyers afloat, primarily due to the excellent range and lethality of their \"Long Lance\" torpedoes. ==Background== Following on the success of the , the Kagerō class was very similar in design, but was slightly larger and incorporated a number of improvements which had been gained through operational experience. It had a heavier main battery and much heavier torpedo armament than other contemporary foreign destroyer designs. The first 15 ships of this class were ordered in 1937 under the 3rd Naval Armaments Supplement Programme and the final four vessels were ordered in 1939 under the 4th Naval Armaments Supplement Programme. The final vessel in the class, , was sometimes mistaken for part of the succeeding by immediate postwar historians due to confusion over the number of fictitious destroyers listed in the Japanese budgetary records in an effort to conceal the budget devoted to the secret battleships. ==Design and description== The Kagerō class used the same hull and bridge as the preceding Asashio class and had an almost identical silhouette. The main visual difference was that the reloads for the forward torpedo launcher were located in front of the launcher instead of to the rear. The ships measured overall, with a beam of and a draft of .Chesneau, p. 194 They displaced at standard load and at deep load.Whitley, pp. 200–01 The displacement and beam were thus slightly larger than for the Asashio class, giving greater stability. Their crew numbered 240 officers and enlisted men. The ships had two Kampon geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by three Kampon water-tube boilers. The turbines were rated at a total of for a designed speed of . The ships had a range of at a speed of .Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 148 had an experimental boiler which developed a higher steam pressure, but this did not result in any increase in performance. ===Armament=== As built, the weapons suite of the Kagerō class was identical to that of the preceding Asashio class. The main battery consisted of six 12.7 cm/50 Type 3 naval guns in three twin-gun turrets, one superfiring pair aft and one turret forward of the superstructure. The guns were capable of 55-degree elevation. The ships were also armed with eight torpedo tubes for the oxygen-fueled Type 93 \"Long Lance\" torpedo in two quadruple traversing mounts; one reload was carried for each tube. Their anti-submarine weapons initially comprised 16 depth charges, which was increased to 36 during the course of the Pacific War. In terms of anti-aircraft capability, initially two twin-mount Type 96 AA guns were placed forward of the second smokestack. As the war progressed, the number of Type 96 guns was gradually increased. In 1942–1943, the twin mounts were replaced by triple mounts, and another twin mount was added forward of the bridge. From 1943 to 1944, on surviving vessels the superfiring \"X\" turret was removed and replaced by two more triple mounts. In late 1944, the seven surviving vessels were fitted with a varying number of additional guns. and received seven single mounts, whereas received 14 single mounts and four Type 93 13 mm machine guns. became the first Japanese destroyer to be equipped with radar when a Type 22 set was installed in late 1942. The other vessels were equipped with radar as they rotated back to Japan for repair or refit. All seven vessels surviving in mid-1944 also received a Type 13 radar. == Operational history== During the war the Kagerō class was used extensively in the Solomons campaign, and wartime attrition was severe, with 18 of 19 vessels lost. In all, six were sunk by air attack, five by submarine attack, five in battle with other surface forces, one by a mine, and the remaining two sunk by a combination of mines and air attack. was the only Kagerō-class ship afloat at the end of the war. All but the (sunk in February of 1942) took part in the Battle of Midway. 7 out of the only 9 destroyers of the Pearl Harbor strike force were of the Kagero class. ==Ships in class== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |+ Construction data |- ! scope=\"col\" | ! scope=\"col\" | Ship ! scope=\"col\" | Kanji ! scope=\"col\" | Shipyard ! scope=\"col\" | Laid down ! scope=\"col\" | Launched ! scope=\"col\" | Completed ! scope=\"col\" | Fate |- ! scope=\"row\" | 17 | | |Maizuru Naval Arsenal | 3 September 1937 | 27 September 1938 | 6 November 1939 | Air attack SW of Rendova (New Georgia Campaign), 8 May 1943 at |- ! scope=\"row\" | 18 | | |Uraga Dock Company | 30 August 1937 | 28 June 1938 | 20 December 1939 | Air attack N of Iloilo, Panay, 27 October 1944 at |- ! scope=\"row\" | 19 | | |Fujinagata Shipyards | 31 August 1937 | 25 October 1938 | 27 January 1940 | Mined leaving Vila, Kolombangara (New Georgia Campain), 8 May 1943 at |- ! scope=\"row\" | 20 | | |Maizuru Naval Arsenal | 29 March 1938 | 29 November 1938 | 20 August 1940 | Mined, air attack leaving Vila, Kolombangara (New Georgia Campaign), 8 May 1943 at |- ! scope=\"row\" | 21 | | |Uraga Dock Company | 30 June 1938 | 19 April 1939 | 31 August 1940 | Scuttled after air attack, Guna Bay (New Guinea Campaign), 24 November 1942 at |- ! scope=\"row\" | 22 | | | Fujinagata Shipyards | 9 December 1937 | 23 February 1939 | 31 August 1940 | Torpedoed S of Makassar, 9 February 1942 at |- ! scope=\"row\" | 23 | | | Kawasaki-Kobe | 3 December 1937 | 24 January 1939 | 15 February 1940 | Sunk in Battle of Empress Augusta Bay, 2 November 1943 at |- ! scope=\"row\" | 24 | | |Sasebo Naval Arsenal | 2 August 1938 | 24 March 1939 | 20 January 1940 | Surrendered to Republic of China on 6 July 1947 at Shanghai, renamed DD-12 Tan Yang (丹陽); scrapped 1970 |- ! scope=\"row\" | 25 | | | Maizuru Naval Arsenal | 14 February 1939 | 19 October 1939 | 26 October 1940 | Air attack E of Xiamen, 6 April 1945 at |- ! scope=\"row\" | 26 | | | Uraga Dock Company | 20 February 1939 | 10 November 1939 | 15 December 1940 | Air attack SE of Finschhafen, 3 March 1943 at |- ! scope=\"row\" | 27 | | | Fujinagata Shipyards | 11 April 1939 | 19 April 1940 | 15 December 1940 | Torpedoed NNW of Keelung, Taiwan, 21 November 1944 at |- ! scope=\"row\" | 28 | | | Sasebo Naval Arsenal | 25 November 1938 | 19 June 1939 | 30 November 1940 | Scuttled SW of Nagasaki following air attack, 7 April 1945 at |- ! scope=\"row\" | 29 | | |Uraga Dock Company | 20 November 1939 | 25 November 1940 | 30 June 1941 | Air attack SW of Nagasaki, 7 April 1945 at |- ! scope=\"row\" | 30 | | |Fujinagata Shipyards | 18 October 1939 | 1 November 1940 | 25 April 1941 | Torpedoed in Sibutu Passage, 9 June 1944 at |- ! scope=\"row\" | 31 | | |Maizuru Naval Arsenal | 8 November 1939 | 17 September 1940 | 28 April 1941 | Sunk in the aftermath of the Battle off Samar, 26 October 1944 at |- ! scope=\"row\" data-sort-value=\"32\" | 32–34 | | | | | | | The dummy for the naval budget of the s |- ! scope=\"row\" | 112 | | |Maizuru Naval Arsenal | 4 May 1939 | 22 April 1940 | 27 January 1941 | Sunk in Battle of Vella Gulf (New Georgia Campaign), 6 August 1943 at |- ! scope=\"row\" | 113 | | |Uraga Dock Company | 23 May 1939 | 18 June 1940 | 31 March 1941 | Sunk in Battle of Vella Gulf, 6 August 1943 at |- ! scope=\"row\" | 114 | | | Fujinagata Shipyards | 22 April 1940 | 13 March 1941 | 15 July 1941 | Sunk in surface action during Operation Hailstone at Truk, 17 February 1944 at |- ! scope=\"row\" | 115 | | |Uraga Dock Company | 2 July 1940 | 11 April 1941 | 27 September 1941 | Torpedoed SE of Zamboanga, Philippines, 11 April 1944 at |} ==In popular culture== A fictional Kagerō-class destroyer named appears in High School Fleet. Another fictional Kagerō-class ship, the Hidoiame, is shown in the Destroyermen series of books written by Taylor Anderson. She appears in Firestorm, Iron Grey Sea, and Storm Surge, and is briefly mentioned again in Straits of Hell. She is said to be the 20th and final ship of the class. ==Notes== ==References== * * * ==Further reading== * , History of Pacific War Vol.64 Mutsuki class destroyer, Gakken (Japan), May 2008, * Collection of writings by Sizuo Fukui Vol.5, Stories of Japanese Destroyers, Kōjinsha (Japan) 1993, * Model Art Extra No.340, Drawings of Imperial Japanese Naval Vessels Part-1, Model Art Co.
