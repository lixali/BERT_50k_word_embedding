He served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Munster constituency from 1989 to 2004 and a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Cork South-Central from 1992 to 1994. Cox was a presenter with RTÉ's Today Tonight. ==Early and personal life== Cox was born in Dublin in 1952, but raised in Limerick. He was then educated at Ardscoil Rís in Limerick, the University of Limerick and Trinity College Dublin. He is married to Cathy, and lived at Ashboro, Shanakiel in the Cork north side suburb of Sunday's Well for 16 years. ==Early career== Cox first came to prominence as a journalist, then a presenter with RTÉ's Today Tonight, a four- nights-a-week current affairs programme which dominated the Irish television schedules in the 1980s. He left the programme to become a political candidate. ==Political career== ===Career in national politics=== Cox stood as a Fianna Fáil candidate at the 1979 local elections. ===Member of the European Parliament, 1989–2004=== Cox was elected an MEP in 1989 for the constituency of Munster, representing the Progressive Democrats (PDs). During his first term, he served on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy. At the 1992 general election, Cox was also elected to Dáil Éireann as a TD for Cork South-Central. Following Desmond O'Malley's retirement from the party leadership in 1993, Cox stood for election to the post but was beaten by Mary Harney. He became deputy leader. Cox left the PDs in 1994 in a dispute over his seat as an MEP. It was expected that Cox would not contest his seat in the 1994 European elections, with O'Malley, who had a large Munster base in Limerick city and County Limerick, becoming the party candidate. However, Cox then decided to contest the seat as an independent, beating O'Malley, the PD candidate. On being elected, he resigned his Dáil seat and a by-election was held on 10 November 1994, which was won by Fine Gael. He subsequently served on the Committee on Institutional Affairs from 1994 until 1997 and on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy from 1997 until 1999.
