 "text": "The 13th United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, consisting of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It met in Washington, D.C. from March 4, 1813, to March 4, 1815, during the fifth and sixth years of James Madison's presidency. The apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives was based on the Third Census of the United States in 1810. Both chambers had a Democratic-Republican majority. The first two sessions were held at the Capitol building while the third, convened after the Burning of Washington, took place in the First Patent Building. ==Major events== * September 10, 1813: War of 1812: Battle of Lake Erie * October 5, 1813: War of 1812: Battle of the Thames * March 27, 1814: Creek War: Battle of Horseshoe Bend * July 25, 1814: War of 1812: Battle of Lundy's Lane * August 25, 1814: War of 1812: Burning of Washington * September 11, 1814: War of 1812: Battle of Lake Champlain * September 13, 1814: War of 1812: Bombardment of Fort McHenry at Baltimore * November 7, 1814: War of 1812: Forces under Gen. Andrew Jackson seized Pensacola * November 23, 1814: Vice President Elbridge Gerry died * December 15, 1814: Hartford Convention convened through January 5, 1815, in which New England Federalists met to discuss their grievances concerning the ongoing War of 1812 and the political problems arising from the federal government's increasing power. Despite radical outcries among Federalists for New England secession and a separate peace with Great Britain, moderates outnumbered them and extreme proposals were not a major focus of the debate. * December 24, 1814: War of 1812: Treaty of Ghent signed * January 8, 1815: War of 1812: Battle of New Orleans ==Major legislation== ==Treaties ratified== * February 17, 1815: War of 1812: Senate ratified the Treaty of Ghent, ==Party summary== The count below identifies party affiliations at the beginning of the first session of this congress.
