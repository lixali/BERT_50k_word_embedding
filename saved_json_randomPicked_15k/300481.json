Francisco is also the brother of amateur boxer, Angel Bojado. ==Amateur career== He compiled an amateur record of 168–15 and represented Mexico at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia. Francisco lost in the second qualifying round at the games. He returned home with his eyes set on turning professional. Shortly after, he was signed by Shelly Finkel, a man who also managed Evander Holyfield and Mike Tyson, among many others. Finkel soon helped Bojado sign a multi-fight deal with cable television channel Showtime. ==Professional career== On January 13 of 2001, he made his professional debut by beating Derrick Castor by knockout in the second round at Uncasville, Connecticut. He followed that victory with eight more knockout wins, including wins over veterans Mauro Lucero, Glenn Forde and Eleazar Contreras. But on February 16, 2002, also at Uncasville, he was upset by Juan Carlos Rubio, who beat him by a ten-round decision. He would later avenge the loss to Rubio, by 12-round decision On January 24, 2004, Francisco defeated experienced Emmanuel Clottey in Atlantic City, New Jersey. On July 24, however, he suffered another setback, when former world Jr. Lightweight champion Jesse James Leija beat him by a split ten-round decision. He walked away from the sport following the loss. In April 2007, Bojado signed a deal with promotional company Golden Boy Promotions, and made his return to the ring on May 4, 2007, against Dairo Esalas at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. Bojado won a unanimous decision.http://www.pound4pound.com/PressRelease/2007/GoldenBoySignsBojado.htm On October 6, 2007, Stephen Forbes won a split-decision upset over Francisco in a junior welterweight bout. usatoday.com, Steven Luevano outpoints tough T-Rex to keep featherweight title ==Outside the ring== Bojado made an appearance on the HBO short series De La Hoya/Mayweather 24/7 as a sparring partner for Oscar De La Hoya.

In 2013 Bojado got back into the ring and started training. ===Professional record=== |- style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:95%;\" |align=\"center\" colspan=8|18 Wins (12 knockouts), 3 Losses, 0 Draw |- style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:95%;\" |align=center style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Res. |align=center style=\"border- style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Record |align=center style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Opponent |align=center style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Type |align=center style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Rd., Time |align=center style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Date |align=center style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Location |align=center style=\"border- style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Notes |-align=center |Loss || 18-3-0 || align=left| Steve Forbes (boxer) |SD || 10 (10) || October 6, 2007 || align=left|Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada |align=left| |-align=center |Win || 18-2-0 || align=left| Rogelio Castañeda, Jr. |TKO || 10 (1:30) || July 27, 2007 || align=left|Desert Diamond Casino, Tucson, Arizona |align=left| |-align=center |Win || 17-2-0 || align=left| Dairo Esalas |UD || 10 (10) || May 4, 2007 || align=left|Boardwalk Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey |align=left| |-align=center |Loss || 16-2-0 || align=left| Jesse James Leija |UD || 10 (10) || July 24, 2004 || align=left|Mohegan Sun Casino, Uncasville, Connecticut |align=left| |-align=center |Win || 16-1-0 ||align=left| Andre Eason |UD || 10 (10) || May 8, 2004 || align=left|Casino Del Sol, Tucson, Arizona |align=left| |-align=center |Win || 15-1-0 ||align=left| Emmanuel Clottey |UD || 10 (10) || January 24, 2004 || align=left|Boardwalk Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey |align=left| |-align=center |Win || 14-1-0 ||align=left| Juan Carlos Rubio |UD || 12 (12) || November 22, 2003 || align=left|Reliant Park, Houston, Texas |align=left|IBA Continental and WBC Continental Americas titles |-align=center |Win || 13-1-0 ||align=left| Lemuel Nelson |UD || 10 (10) || August 9, 2003 || align=left|Miami Arena, Miami, Florida |align=left| |-align=center |Win || 12-1-0 || align=left| William Adamyan |TKO || 6 (3:00) || May 10, 2003 || align=left|Pechanga Center, Temecula, California |align=left|Adamyan was undefeated going in |-align=center |Win || 11-1-0 || align=left| Frankie Santos |TKO || 10 (0:45) || February 1, 2003 || align=left|Mohegan Sun Casino, Uncasville, Connecticut |align=left| |-align=center |Win || 10-1-0 ||align=left| Frankie Sanchez |UD || 8 (8) || October 19, 2002 || align=left|Reliant Park, Houston, Texas |align=left| |-align=center |Loss || 9-1-0 ||align=left| Juan Carlos Rubio |UD || 10 (10) || February 16, 2002 || align=left|Mohegan Sun Casino, Uncasville, Connecticut |align=left| |-align=center |Win || 9-0-0 ||align=left| Mauro Lucero |KO || 1 (0:12) || November 3, 2001 || align=left|MGM Grand, Las Vegas, Nevada |align=left| |-align=center |Win || 8-0-0 ||align=left| Eleazar Contreras |KO || 2 (2:00) || October 13, 2001 || align=left|Tropicana Hotel & Casino, Atlantic City, New Jersey |align=left|Won the WBC Youth World Light Welterweight title |-align=center |Win || 7-0-0 || align=left| Manuel Varela |TKO || 1 (2:17) || September 1, 2001 || align=left|Don Haskins Convention Center, El Paso, Texas |align=left| |-align=center |Win || 6-0-0 || align=left| Glenn Forde |KO || 2 (0:08) || June 23, 2001 || align=left|Mohegan Sun Casino, Uncasville, Connecticut |align=left| |-align=center |Win || 5-0-0 ||align=left| Ernesto Fuentes |TKO || 1 (2:41) || May 19, 2001 || align=left|Mohegan Sun Casino, Uncasville, Connecticut |align=left| |-align=center |Win || 4-0-0 ||align=left| David Montes |KO || 3 (2:48) || May 5, 2001 || align=left|Don Haskins Convention Center, El Paso, Texas |align=left| |-align=center |Win || 3-0-0 ||align=left| Mario Lacey |KO || 1 (1:24) || April 20, 2001 || align=left|Ballys Park Hotel Casino, Atlantic City, New Jersey |align=left|Lacey was undefeated going in |-align=center |Win || 2-0-0 || align=left| Alejandro Rivera |TKO || 1 (2:08) || March 2, 2001 || align=left|Texas Station Casino, North Las Vegas, Nevada |align=left| |-align=center |Win || 1-0-0 || align=left| Detrick Castor |TKO || 2 (1:38) || January 13, 2001 || align=left|Mohegan Sun Casino, Uncasville, Connecticut |align=left| |-align=center ==References== ==External links== * Category:Boxers from Jalisco Category:Sportspeople from Guadalajara, Jalisco Category:Olympic boxers of Mexico Category:Boxers at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Mexican male boxers Category:Welterweight boxers",
