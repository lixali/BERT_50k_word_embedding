 "text": "Lionsgate Television is the television division of Lionsgate, which is a Canadian–American entertainment company. ==History== The company was established in July 1997 as Lions Gate Television, Inc. with the establishment of Lionsgate Films. It acquired documentary/reality production company Termite Art Productions in June 1998 and was then reacquired by Erik Nelson in September 2004 and officially renamed Termite Art as Creative Differences. The company acquired Mandalay Television in 1997, before acquiring a minority investment in Mandalay Entertainment outright before splitting in 2002. Lionsgate later sold off its shares in Mandalay Television in 1999. By March 12, 1999, Lions Gate Television, Inc. became an incorporated entity. In 2003, Lionsgate and New Line Television set up a partnership to provide 20 motion pictures designed for television. On July 12, 2006, Lionsgate expanded into television syndication when the company acquired television distribution company Debmar–Mercury. Before the acquisition, Debmar–Mercury syndicated the film library of Lionsgate. 20th Television handled advert sales to the series distributed by Debmar–Mercury with the exception of Meet the Browns, as the advert sales are handled by Disney–ABC Domestic Television and Turner Television co distributing the series. On March 13, 2012, Lionsgate Television formed a new joint venture of 50/50 with Thunderbird Films, the company founded by Frank Giustra who was the founder and chairman of Lionsgate. The new venture was then called “Sea to Sky Entertainment”. More recently, Lionsgate and Walin Chambers Entertainment renewed its overall deal. Another overall deal more recently is The Tannenbaum Company. == Productions == ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Television production companies of the United States Category:Lionsgate subsidiaries",
