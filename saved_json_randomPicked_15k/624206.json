Launched on 15 December 1974, it is Australia's first fully licensed FM radio station and it has since reached over 630,000 listeners. ==Format== Approximately 80 percent of Fine Music Sydney's on-air music content is from the western classical and related traditions which include baroque music, opera, contemporary classical music and chamber music. The remainder is made up of jazz, blues, operetta, piano music, film soundtracks, oldies, sacred music, ethnic music, ambient music, and non-mainstream and experimental contemporary music.Fine Music Sydney Classical Programs Fine Music Sydney ==Background== The station broadcasts from studios located at Chandos Street, St Leonards, to the greater Sydney region at a frequency of 102.5 MHz from a 50 kilowatt (ERP) transmitter located atop Governor Phillip Tower, in Sydney's central business district. Its operations are conducted by volunteers and a small number of paid staff. Operational funding is principally derived from corporate sponsorship, arts partnerships, philanthropic donations, listener subscriptions, and the secondhand Book and CD Fairs held around the Sydney area. In February 2020, the station rebranded from Fine Music 102.5 to Fine Music Sydney. ==Programming== One of the station's most popular programmes for several decades was Evensong, a weekly programme of English sacred music in the Anglican tradition. Its regular presenter Mrs. Ann Ramsay died at the age of 91 on 1 April 2006. Evensong has been replaced by another popular Sunday program, Hosanna. Popular non-classical programmes broadcast by the station include the blues show Stormy Monday, which has aired on Monday evenings for three decades, and for many years was rebroadcast nationally by the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia (CBAA) satellite service. Ultima Thule, the station's Sunday evening ambient music programme has been on air for nearly twenty years, and in 2005 became the first programme to be podcast on Australian community radio.
