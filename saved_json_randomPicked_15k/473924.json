The Council merged with Antrim Borough Council in April 2015 under local government reform in Northern Ireland to form Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council. ==History== Newtownabbey was founded in 1958 as a result of the Newtownabbey Urban District Act (Northern Ireland) 1957 and comprises large urban residential areas along with traditional farming communities. Its major industries include electronics, software and telecommunications development and agriculture. Council headquarters were at Mossley Mill in Newtownabbey. Towns within the area included Ballyclare and Glengormley. The University of Ulster at Jordanstown is also in the area covered by the former Council. The Newtownabbey Borough Council area consisted of four electoral areas: Antrim Line, Macedon, University, and Ballyclare. At the 2011 elections, 25 members were elected from the following political parties: 12 Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), 5 Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), 5 Alliance Party, 1 Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and 2 Sinn Féin. At the Annual General Meeting of the Council on the first Monday in June each year the Mayor was elected and became the first citizen of the Borough. In elections for the Westminster Parliament it was split between the East Antrim constituency, the South Antrim constituency and the North Belfast constituency. In May 2015 Newtownabbey Borough Council merged with Antrim Borough Council to form the new Antrim and Newtownabbey District Council. ==Elections== When first created for the 1973 local elections, the council consisted of four electoral areas, named A, B, C and D, which elected 21 councillors. For the 1985 local elections, the number of electoral areas was increased to five: Manse Road, Doagh Road, Shore Road, Antrim Line and Ballyclare, each of which elected five councillors. Boundary changes again took effect for the 1993 local elections. The Doagh Road area, centred on Rathcoole was reduced from five to four wards. Consequently it gained the Whiteabbey and Cloughfern wards from the Shore Road district to form the new Macedon district. The Antrim Line district gained the Burnthill ward from the Manse Road district and the Mallusk ward from the Ballyclare district (which had gained a ward in the boundary changes.) The remaining seven wards of the Manse Road and Shore Road districts were combined to form the University district. In relation to the 1973–1981 districts, Ballyclare is similar to Area A, Macedon to Area B, University to Area C and Antrim Line to Area D. ==Summary of seats won 1973–2011== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" ! !! 1973 !! 1977 !! 1981 !! 1985 !! 1989 !! 1993 !! 1997 !! 2001 !! 2005 !! 2011 |- | Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) || 9 || 8 || 9 || 10 || 11 || 10 || 10 || 9 || 6 || 5 |- | Alliance (APNI) || 3 || 6 || 3 || 2 || 4 || 4 || 3 || 1 || 2 || 5 |- | Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) || 3 || 4 || 5 || 9 || 6 || 5 || 2 || 8 || 12 || 12 |- | Independent Unionist (IU) || 3 || || 3 || 2 || 2 || 4 || 3 || || 1 || |- | Loyalist (Loy) || 2 || 1 || || || || || || || || |- | Labour† || 1 || 1 || 1 || 1 || 1 || 1 || 2 || 1 || || |- | Unionist Party of Northern Ireland (UPNI) || || 1 || || || || || || || || |- | Independent (Ind) || || || 1 || 1 || || || || || || |- | Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) || || || || || 1 || 1 || 1 || 2 || 1 || 1 |- | Newtownabbey Ratepayers' Association (NRA) || || || || || || || 2 || 1 || 1 || |- | Ulster Democratic Party (UDP) || || || || || || || 1 || 1 || || |- | Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) || || || || || || || 1 || || || |- | Sinn Féin (SF) || || || || || || || || 1 || 1 || 2 |- | United Unionist Coalition (UUC) || || || || || || || || 1 || 1 || |- |} † Results for Labour are those for Robert Kidd and Mark Langhammer.
