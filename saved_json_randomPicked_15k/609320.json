The Post Office opened on 9 September 1891 and closed in 1974. The town is known for its rich soil used for growing flowers and potatoes, and its abundance of uncommon farm animals, such as goats and alpacas. It was featured in one of MMM Melbourne's suburban songs performed by \"The Scared Weird Little Guys\". ==References== ==External links== *Australian Places: Macclesfield, Victoria *Macclesfield CFA Category:Mining towns in Victoria (Australia)",
