 "text": "Lee County is a county located in the U.S. state of Illinois. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 36,031. Its county seat is Dixon. The Dixon, IL Micropolitan Statistical Area includes all of Lee County. ==History== The area's first non-native settlers were mostly from the six New England states.Stevens, Frank Everett. History of Lee County, Illinois, Vol. 1 p. 382 The early nineteenth century saw a wave of westward movement from New England, due largely to completion of the Erie Canal and the end of the Black Hawk War.Holbrook, Stewart Hall. The Yankee Exodus: An Account of Migration from New England, University of Washington Press (1968)Shalev, Eran. American Zion: The Old Testament as a Political Text from the Revolution to ..., Yale University Press (March 26, 2013) pp. 70-71 The area that included present-day Lee County was delineated as St. Clair County in 1809. In 1823, a large section of northern St. Clair County was partitioned off as Fulton County. In 1825, the northwestern portion of that county was partitioned off as Putnam County. In 1831, the area was further partitioned into Jo Daviess County. A section of that county was partitioned off in 1836 as Ogle County, and in 1839 the bottom half of Ogle County was split off as Lee County. It is largely understood that the county's name honors \"Lighthorse Harry\" Lee, an officer in the American Revolutionary War. An alternative theory suggests the name honors Richard Henry Lee, a member of the Continental Congress (the Declaration of Independence was adopted pursuant to the Lee Resolution). President Ronald Reagan lived in Dixon as a boy and attended Dixon High School.
