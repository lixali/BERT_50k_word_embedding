 "text": "LaSalle () is a borough (arrondissement) of the city of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Prior to 2002, it was a separate municipality that had been incorporated in 1912. LaSalle is located in the south-west portion of the Island of Montreal, along the Saint Lawrence river. ==History== LaSalle was named for the area's first seigneur, French explorer René-Robert Cavelier de La Salle (1643–1687). The area became part of a municipality during the mid 19th century, and LaSalle was incorporated as an independent municipality in 1912. The Lachine Rapids are situated within LaSalle territory. The name Lachine, which is also the name of the neighbouring borough, stayed because the LaSalle area was part of the parish of Saints-Anges-de-la-Chine during the French regime period. Before the creation of the Lachine Canal in the 1820s, the rapids had to be portaged on a trail called Chemin LaSalle (what is now LaSalle Boulevard). LaSalle is known for its many public schools, most notably l'École secondaire Cavelier-de-LaSalle, known as one of the top talent- producing schools in the fields of dance and song. The other common public school in LaSalle is LaSalle Community Comprehensive High School, opened many years ago and home to many cultures. Michel Leduc, who served as mayor from 1983 to December 31, 2001, was the last mayor of an independent LaSalle. Under Leduc, LaSalle became the first large city in Quebec to launch a large recycling program. LaSalle was annexed by the city of Montreal on January 1, 2002, along with a number of other cities on the Island of Montreal. ==Geography== LaSalle is bounded by five adjacent municipalities and boroughs, these being Lachine towards the west, Verdun and the inner city neighbourhood of Ville-Émard in correlation to the north-east, and Montreal West and the neighbourhood of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce within the borough of Côte-des- Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce towards the north, the latter two being divided by Autoroute 20 as well as the Lachine Canal. All complemented by the shore of the Saint Lawrence River to the south and east, specifically a portion of the river known as the Lachine Rapids. ==Government== thumbnail|The Borough Hall of LaSalle. ===Federal and provincial elections=== Federally, the western part of the borough is located in Dorval—Lachine—LaSalle and the eastern part in LaSalle—Émard—Verdun.
