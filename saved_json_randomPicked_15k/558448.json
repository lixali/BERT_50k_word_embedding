 "text": "Dirty Hits is a greatest hits album by Scottish rock band Primal Scream. It was released on 3 November 2003 by Columbia Records. The album is generally made up of chronologically listed singles, except the album tracks \"Long Life\", \"Shoot Speed/Kill Light\", and \"Deep Hit of Morning Sun\". The rare C86 single \"Velocity Girl\" is not included, neither is anything from Sonic Flower Groove or their self-titled 1989 album. Tracks from this period appeared on the compilation's sequel; Shoot Speed â€“ More Dirty Hits, released five months later. Early limited versions came in a card sleeve with a bonus disc of remixes; most had previously appeared as B-sides. ==Track listing== ==References== ==External links== *Dirty Hits at YouTube (streamed copy where licensed) Category:Primal Scream albums Category:2003 compilation albums",
