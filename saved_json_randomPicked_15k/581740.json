The company relied on its famous Flathead V8 for most models, only seriously producing six-cylinder engines in the 1960s. The company was also late with a V6 engine, introducing a compact British V6 in 1967 but waiting until the 1980s to move their products to rely on V6 engines. The company has relied on six major V6 families ever since, the Cologne/Taunus V6, Essex V6, Canadian Essex V6, Vulcan V6, Mondeo V6 and Cyclone V6. The first three of these lines are no longer in production, leaving only the Mondeo and Cyclone as the company's midrange engines. * 1906-1907 Model K straight-6 * 1941-2016 Straight-6 ** 1941-1951 226 CID Flathead ** 1948-1953 254 CID Flathead used in buses and two ton trucks ** 1952-1964 OHV (215, 223, 262) 215-223 used in car and non-HD pickups. 262 used in HD trucks only. ** 1960-1993 (Longer in Australia) 'Falcon Six' OHV (144, 170, 200, 250) car usage. ** 1964-1996 OHV (240, 300, 4.9 L) truck 6 built in Cleveland, Ohio ** 1988-2002 Ford Australia SOHC I6 Falcon engines *** 1988-1989 3.2 L SOHC *** 1988-1992 3.9 L SOHC *** 1992-2002 4.0 L SOHC *** 1998-2002 4.0 L SOHC VCT ** 2002-2016 Ford Australia Barra DOHC I6 4.0 L engines * 1951-1966 Zephyr 6--(United Kingdom) * 1966-1988 (2000 in South Africa) British Essex V6--60° British V6 2.5/3.0/3.1/3.4 L * 1964-2011 Cologne/Taunus V6--1.8-4.0 L pushrod and SOHC V6 * 1982-2008 Canadian Essex V6 --90° V6, 3.8/3.9/4.2 L models * 1986-1987 Ford-Cosworth GBA engine--120° V6, 1.5 L (Formula One engine) * 1986-1992 Cologne/Ranger, Bronco II V6 -- 2.8/2.9/4.0OHV/4.0SOHC L * 1986-2007 Vulcan V6--60° pushrod V6 3.0 L, originally designed for the Taurus * 1989-1995 SHO V6 3.0/3.2 L DOHC V6 * 1994-2012 Mondeo V6 aluminum 60° DOHC ** 1994-2002 Duratec 25--2.5 L ** 1996-2012 Duratec 30--3.0 L ** 2000-2011 Jaguar AJ-V6--2.1/2.5/3.0 L * 2003-present Ecotorq--7.3/9.0/12.7 L Diesel * 2004-present AJD-V6--2.7 L Diesel * 2006-2016 SI6--3.0/3.2 L I6 designed by Volvo * 2006-present Cyclone V6 aluminum 60° DOHC ** 2018 Duratec 33--3.3 L ** 2006-present Duratec 35--3.5 L ** 2007-present Duratec 37--3.7 L *2009-present EcoBoost V6 engine ** 2015-present EcoBoost--2.7 L ** 2016-present EcoBoost--3.0 L ** 2009-present EcoBoost--3.5 L ==8 cylinder== Ford introduced the Flathead V8 in their affordable 1932 Model 18, becoming a performance leader for decades. In the 1950s, Ford introduced a three-tier approach to engines, with small, mid- sized, and larger engines aimed at different markets.
