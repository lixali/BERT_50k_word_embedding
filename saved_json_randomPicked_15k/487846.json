 "text": "The Black Ships (in , Edo period term) was the name given to Western vessels arriving in Japan in the 16th and 19th centuries. In 1543 Portuguese initiated the first contacts, establishing a trade route linking Goa to Nagasaki. The large carracks engaged in this trade had the hull painted black with pitch, and the term came to represent all Western vessels. In 1639, after suppressing a rebellion blamed on the influence of Christian thought, the ruling Tokugawa shogunate retreated into an isolationist policy, the Sakoku. During this \"locked state\", contact with Japan by Westerners was restricted to Dejima island at Nagasaki. In 1844, William II of the Netherlands urged Japan to open, but was rejected. On July 8, 1853, the U.S. Navy sent four warships into the bay at Edo and threatened to attack if Japan did not begin trade with the West. Their arrival marked the reopening of the country to political dialogue after more than two hundred years of self-imposed isolation. Trade with Western nations would not come until the Treaty of Amity and Commerce more than five years later. In particular, kurofune refers to Mississippi, Plymouth, Saratoga, and Susquehanna of the Perry Expedition for the opening of Japan, 1852–1854, that arrived on July 14, 1853, at Uraga Harbor (part of present-day Yokosuka) in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan under the command of United States Commodore Matthew Perry. Black refers to the black color of the older sailing vessels, and the black smoke from the coal-fired steam engines of the American ships. In this sense, the kurofune became a symbol of the ending of isolation. thumb|Brooklyn Museum – Commodore Matthew Perry's \"Black Ship\" ==First kurofune ships: nau do trato== In 1543 Portuguese traders arrived in Japan initiating the first contacts with the West. Soon they established a trade route linking their headquarters in Goa, via Malacca to Nagasaki. Large carracks engaged in the flourishing \"Nanban trade\", introducing modern inventions from the European traders, such as refined sugar, optics, and firearms; it was the firearms, arquebuses, which became a major innovation of the Sengoku period—a time of intense internal warfare—when the matchlocks were replicated. Later, they engaged in triangular trade, exchanging silver from Japan with silk from China via Macau. Carracks of 1200 to 1600 tons, named nau do trato (\"treaty ship\") or nau da China by the Portuguese, engaged in this trade had the hull painted black with pitch, and the term came to apply for all western vessels. The name was inscribed in the Nippo Jisho, the first western Japanese dictionary compiled in 1603. In 1549 Spanish missionary Francis Xavier started a Jesuit mission in Japan. Christianity spread, mingled with the new trade, making 300,000 converts among peasants and some daimyō (warlords). In 1637 the Shimabara Rebellion blamed on the Christian influence was suppressed. Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries faced progressively tighter restrictions, and were confined to the island of Dejima before being expelled in 1639. The Tokugawa shogunate retreated back into a policy of isolationism identified as , forbidding contact with most outside countries. Only a limited-scale trade and diplomatic relations with China, Korea, the Ryukyu Islands, and the Dutch was maintained.Ronald P. Toby, State and Diplomacy in Early Modern Japan: Asia in the Development of the Tokugawa Bakufu, Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, (1984) 1991. The Sakoku policy remained in effect until 1853 with the arrival of Commodore Perry and the \"opening\" of Japan. ==Gunboat diplomacy== Commodore Perry's superior military force was the principal factor in negotiating a treaty allowing American trade with Japan, thus effectively ending the Sakoku period of more than 200 years in which trading with Japan had been permitted to the Dutch, Koreans, Chinese, and Ainu exclusively. The sight of the four ships entering Edo Bay, roaring black smoke into the air and capable of moving under their own power, deeply frightened the Japanese. Perry ignored the requests arriving from the shore that he should move to Nagasaki—the official port for trade with the outside—and threatened in turn to take his ships directly to Edo, and burn the city to the ground if he was not allowed to land. It was eventually agreed upon that he should land nearby at Kurihama, whereupon he delivered his letter and left. The following year, at the Convention of Kanagawa, Perry returned with a fleet of eight of the fearsome Black Ships, to demonstrate the power of the United States navy, and to lend weight to his announcement that he would not leave again, until he had a treaty. In the interim following his previous visit, the Tokugawa shogunate had learned about the Opium Wars and the opening of China in terms of trade to foreign powers and the subsequent territorial concessions made by the Chinese government. The shogunate realized that if they wished for their country to avoid a similar fate—they would need to make peace with the Europeans and Americans. After roughly a month of negotiations, the shōguns officials presented Perry with the Treaty of Peace and Amity. Perry refused certain conditions of the treaty but agreed to defer their resolution to a later time, and finally establishing formal diplomatic relations between Japan and the United States. The fleet departed, leaving behind a consul at Shimoda to negotiate a more permanent agreement. The Harris Treaty was signed with the United States on July 29, 1858, and within five years of the signing of the Treaty of Peace and Amity, Japan had moved to sign treaties with other Western countries. The surprise and fear inspired by the first visit of the Black Ships are described in this famous kyōka (a humorous poem in 31-syllable waka form): thumb|Commodore Perry's fleet for his second visit to Japan in 1854. > {| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" style=\"margin: 1ex 1em;\" | > style=\"padding-right: 2em\" | 泰平の|| style=\"padding-right: 2em\" |Taihei no |- > | style=\"padding-right: 2em\" | 眠りを覚ます|| style=\"padding-right: 2em\" |Nemuri o > samasu |- | style=\"padding-right: 2em\" | 上喜撰|| style=\"padding-right: 2em\" > |Jōkisen |- |style=\"padding-right: 2em\" | たった四杯で|| style=\"padding-right: > 2em\" |Tatta shihai de |- | style=\"padding-right: 2em\" | 夜も眠れず|| > style=\"padding-right: 2em\" |Yoru mo nemurezu |} This poem is a complex set of puns (in Japanese, kakekotoba or \"pivot words\"). Taihei (泰平) means \"tranquil\"; Jōkisen (上喜撰) is the name of a costly brand of green tea containing large amounts of caffeine; and shihai (四杯) means \"four cups\", so a literal translation of the poem is: There is an alternative translation, based on the pivot words. Taihei can refer to the \"Pacific Ocean\" (太平); jōkisen also means \"steam-powered ships\" (蒸気船); and shihai also means \"four vessels\". The poem, therefore, has a hidden meaning: Kurofune (\"The Black Ships\") is also the title of the first Japanese opera, composed by Kosaku Yamada, \"based on the story of Tojin Okichi, a geisha caught up in the turmoil that swept Japan in the waning years of the Tokugawa shogunate\", which premiered in 1940. ==See also== * Treaty of Shimoda * Russian frigate Pallada * French Military Mission to Japan (1867-1868) * Gunboat diplomacy * Dutch missions to Edo * Sakoku * United States expedition to Korea * Pacific Overtures, a musical about Japan's westernization in the 19th century by Stephen Sondheim * Madama Butterfly, an opera about a US Navy officer and his Japanese wife by Giacomo Puccini ==Notes== ==References== * * [digitized by University of Hong Kong Libraries, Digital Initiatives, \"China Through Western Eyes.\" ] * [digitized by University of Hong Kong Libraries, Digital Initiatives, \"China Through Western Eyes.\" ] ==External links== *Black Ship Festival celebrating the arrival of the Blackships and the opening of Japan to the world. *New National Theatre Tokyo *Opera Japonica Category:Articles containing Japanese poems Category:History of United States expansionism Category:Japan–United States relations Category:History of the foreign relations of Japan Category:Edo period Category:1853 in the United States Category:Meiji Restoration Category:Maritime history of Portugal",
