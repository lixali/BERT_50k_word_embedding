He moved to Idaho, pursued work as a miner, and was married to Ruth Maynard on November 10, 1896. ==Career== Elected to the Idaho State House of Representatives in 1892, Hunt held that position until 1894. Hunt served as a captain in the Idaho Regiment of Volunteers in the Philippines during the Spanish–American War (1898). Elected governor in 1900 at the age of 38 Hunt remains the youngest governor in Idaho history. In March 1901 Hunt signed legislation creating the Academy of Idaho (now Idaho State University) in Pocatello. Hunt also ended the state of martial law in northern Idaho enacted by his predecessor, Frank Steunenberg, in 1899 as a response to labor unrest. Hunt was defeated for reelection in 1902 by Republican John T. Morrison. After leaving office he became vice president and general manager of Dewey Combination Lease Company. ==Death== Late in 1906 Hunt contracted pneumonia in Goldfield, Nevada and died on November 25, in Boise, Idaho, at the age of 44. He is buried in Boise in the Pioneer Cemetery (which has become known as \"The Masonic Cemetery\"). The Gem County Museum in Emmett includes an exhibit of his belongings. ==References== ==External links== *National Governors Association *The Political Graveyard * Category:1861 births Category:1906 deaths Category:American military personnel of the Spanish–American War Category:Governors of Idaho Category:United States Army officers Category:People from Newport, Kentucky Category:Democratic Party state governors of the United States Category:Idaho Democrats Category:19th- century American Episcopalians Category:19th-century American politicians Category:20th-century American politicians",
