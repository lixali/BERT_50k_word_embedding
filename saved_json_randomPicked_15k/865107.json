It is similar to straw, the residue left after any cereal grain or grass has been harvested at maturity for its seed. It can be directly grazed by cattle or dried for use as fodder. Stover has attracted some attention as a potential fuel source, and as biomass for fermentation or as a feedstock for cellulosic ethanol production.. Stover from various crops can also be used in mushroom compost preparation. The word 'stover' derives from the English legal term 'estovers', referring to the right of tenants to cut timber.Collins English Dictionary, Ninth Edition (2007) == See also == * Corn stover * Crop residue ==Notes== Category:Biodegradable materials Category:Energy crops Category:Fodder",
