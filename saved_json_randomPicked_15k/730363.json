 "text": "Canoeing at the 2000 Summer Olympics was held at the Sydney International Regatta Centre for the sprint events and the Whitewater Stadium in Penrith for the canoe and kayak slalom disciplines. The repechage rounds that ran from the 1960 to the 1996 Games were eliminated in the sprint events while qualifying rounds were added to the slalom events. Additionally, a quota system for each event was enacted, meaning each event had a limited number of competitors that could compete. A total of 16 events were contested, 12 sprint events (9 for men and 3 for women) and 4 slalom events (3 for men and 1 for women). ==Medal summary== ===By event=== ====Slalom==== Men {| |-valign=\"top\" | C-1 | | | |-valign=\"top\" | C-2 | | | |-valign=\"top\" | K-1 | | | |} Women {| |- | K-1 | | | |} ====Sprint==== Men {| |-valign=\"top\" |C-1 500 metres | | | |-valign=\"top\" |C-1 1000 metres | | | |-valign=\"top\" |C-2 500 metres | | | |-valign=\"top\" |C-2 1000 metres | | | |-valign=\"top\" |K-1 500 metres | | | |-valign=\"top\" |K-1 1000 metres | | | |-valign=\"top\" |K-2 500 metres | | | |-valign=\"top\" |K-2 1000 metres | | | |-valign=\"top\" |K-4 1000 metres | Ákos Vereckei Gábor Horváth Zoltán Kammerer Botond Storcz | Jan Schäfer Mark Zabel Björn Bach Stefan Ulm | Grzegorz Kotowicz Adam Seroczyński Dariusz Białkowski Marek Witkowski |} Women {| |-valign=\"top\" ||K-1 500 metres | | | |-valign=\"top\" |K-2 500 metres | | | |-valign=\"top\" |K-4 500 metres | Birgit Fischer Manuela Mucke Anett Schuck Katrin Wagner | Rita Kőbán Katalin Kovács Szilvia Szabó Erzsébet Viski | Raluca Ioniţǎ Mariana Limbău Elena Radu Sanda Toma |} ===By nation=== ==References== *2000 Summer Olympics Canoe slalom results. *2000 Summer Olympics Canoe sprint results.
