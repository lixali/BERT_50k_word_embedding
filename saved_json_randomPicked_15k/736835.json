The contract involved the \"Thundervision\" project, meant to provide oversized video screens and perhaps content services during air shows that featured the Air Force Thunderbirds. The investigation revolves around possible involvement of Jumper, and then Chief of Staff of the Air Force T. Michael Moseley. It was suggested that the contract price was inflated, because a friend of the two generals, Air Force General (ret.) Hal Hornburg, was associated with Strategic Message Solutions. Two companies involved in the bidding process protested award of the contract, one having offered comparable services for half as much. The Air Force later cancelled the contract. ==See also== *List of commanders of USAFE ==Notes== ==External links== *Biography of General Jumper, USAF, September 2005. * *Interview with General Jumper: Air Force Transformation, Military Aerospace Technology, May 1, 2002. *First-year cadet criticizes USAF Chief of Staff's personnel decisions, Snopes, March 26, 2003. *Speech at the Air Force Association convention, September 16, 2003. *Speech at the Air Force Association symposium, February 12, 2004.
