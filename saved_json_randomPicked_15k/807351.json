The Trust employs 78 full and part-time staff who are aided by more than 1,300 volunteers drawn mainly from Trust's 16 area groups (members' groups), each of which is based on one of the county's main towns. The area groups also organise meetings, visits and social events and are involved in fundraising and membership recruitment. 5,000 of the Trust's members are under 16 years of age; these are catered for by the organisation's junior wing Wildlife Watch which runs seven groups around the county organising events for children. The Trust's income is derived mainly from members' subscriptions, money raised by area groups and members, donations, grants from local authorities and government agencies (usually for special projects), profits from the Trust's sales business and from legacies. == Sites == ===Key=== ====Public access==== *BPA = access only by prior arrangement with the Trust *No = no public access *Yes = public access to all or most of the site {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"100%\" !Site !Image !Area !Location !Public Access !Classifications !Description |- |Ancaster Valley | | | | Yes | | A steep-sided valley best known for its flower-rich limestone grassland.
