The stadium, which also hosted rugby union and athletics events, is located on route d'Arlon, in the Luxembourg City quarter of Belair. Following the opening of the Stade de Luxembourg in September 2021, the stadium and its grounds are currently due for demolition and redevelopment. ==History== Originally called Stade Municipal after its construction in 1928–1931, it was entirely rebuilt in 1990. Since July 1993, it has borne the name of Joseph \"Josy\" Barthel, the 1500m gold medalist at the 1952 Olympics: Luxembourg's only Olympic gold medal winner. The stadium is also home to the biggest athletics club in the country, CAL Spora Luxembourg. The spectator capacity is 7,983,https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/FirstDiv/uefaorg/Publications/01/67/03/93/1670393_DOWNLOAD.pdf some under cover, some in the open air. In 2014 it was announced that an investment of €230,000 would be required to get the stadium up to a sufficient standard to hold the qualifying matches for Euro 2016. In June 2014, the Luxembourg Ministry of Sport, in conjunction with the Luxembourg City administration, decided upon the construction of the new Stade de Luxembourg in Gasperich, currently due to open in 2021. As a result, the Luxembourg City authorities have announced their intentions to demolish the Stade Josy Barthel and redevelop its grounds and surrounding areas. ==See also== *Stade de Luxembourg ==References== ==External links== *Illustrated page from Racing FC *StadiumDB photos Category:Football venues in Luxembourg Category:Athletics (track and field) venues in Luxembourg Luxembourg Category:Sports venues in Luxembourg City Category:Sports venues completed in 1931",
