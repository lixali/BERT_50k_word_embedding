Philippines (10th ed.). Maribyrnong: Lonely Planet. This spicy Filipino dish has Spanish origins, but the meaning in its original language, and even region of origin, are now lost. == Preparation == It is sauteed and stir-fried (until crispy) with finely-chopped pig innards and cooked in onion, tomato, garlic, and pepper. Recipes for bopis may differ from region to region and family to family, with regard to ingredients, spices and flavoring.
