Harris was named principal of Baton Rouge High School. Five years later, he became the state education superintendent and held that post until 1940. The present campus was put into use in 1925 (although some sources cite 1927 or 1928 as the year the new building opened) when the main four-story building was built. Additional buildings were added and renovations made during the 1950s. By 1972, the present facilities were completed and air conditioning was installed. In the fall of 1976, the school began operating under the new Magnet School Curriculum, and the Class of 1980 became the first graduating class to attend all four full years under the Magnet Program. Numerous district and state championships have been won as is attested by the vast collection of trophies on view in the lobby. Though the major sports of football, basketball, and baseball were discontinued in 1976, the individual and life-time sports have continued a tradition of winning district and state championships. State and district rally honors have increased, as have the number of National Merit Students among the student body. The main three to four story neo-Gothic brick and terra cotta building, along with a portion of the campus, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 6, 1986. with four photos and two maps With The 4th floor of the school used to be home to the band and orchestra, but is now closed off to the student body.
