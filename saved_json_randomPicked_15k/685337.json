 "text": "The Kids Will Have Their Say is the debut album by the Boston hardcore punk band SS Decontrol. The album was released in 1982 as a split-release between Dischord and X-Claim records (catalog numbers X-Claim 1/Dischord 7Â½). The album was only pressed in 1,000 copies and never re-pressed, making it quite a collector's item. However, a bootleg version was made in the late 1980s, but the label names on the back of the sleeves are switched to Discord and Ex- Claim, making it easy to separate from the original pressing. ==Track listing== ===Side A=== #\"Boiling Point\" (0:54) #\"Fight Them\" (1:07) #\"Do You Even Care\" (0:29) #\"Not Normal\" (0:52) #\"Wasted Youth\" (0:33) #\"Jock Itch\" (0:46) #\"Fun to You\" (0:34) #\"V.A.\" (0:59) #\"How Much Art\" (3:05) ===Side B=== #\"The Kids Will Have Their Say\" (1:20) #\"Headed Straight\" (1:29) #\"War Threat\" (1:27) #\"Teach Me Violence\" (0:36) #\"Screw\" (0:21) #\"Who's to Judge\" (1:26) #\"Police Beat\" (1:58) #\"United\" (0:46) #\"The End\" (1:28) ==Personnel== *Springa - vocals *Al Barile - guitar *Jaime Sciarappa - bass *Chris Foley - drums Category:1982 debut albums Category:SSD (band) albums Category:Dischord Records albums",
