Savanna Soils of Minnesota. Minnesota: Self. pp. 61 - 64. . thumb|Soils of Tamarack Nature Center ==History== With the establishment of the Minnesota Territory in 1849, nine counties, including Ramsey County, were created. In 1849, Ramsey County included all of what later became the present-day counties of Ramsey, Anoka, Isanti, and Kanabec; and part of Washington, Pine, Carlton, Aitkin, Mille Lacs, and Hennepin. One of Ramsey County's early settlers was Heman Gibbs, whose farm is now operated as the Gibbs Museum of Pioneer and Dakotah Life (Gibbs Farm) in Falcon Heights. Ramsey County remained largely farmland until small villages began to appear in the late 19th century, with the incorporation of North St. Paul in 1887, New Brighton in 1891, and White Bear Lake in 1921. ==Government and politics== Ramsey County is overwhelmingly Democratic in presidential elections, having not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1924. In 2020, Democratic nominee Joe Biden received the largest share of the vote for any candidate in the county's history, with over 71%. ===County Sheriff=== The Ramsey County Sheriff's Office was established in the old Minnesota Territory in 1849. The current sheriff is Bob Fletcher, who won the general election for Ramsey County Sheriff on November 6, 2018. The Ramsey County Sheriff is elected for a four-year term via an election running concurrent with the federal mid-term elections. The sheriff's office provides patrol and investigation for communities without local police forces and is available as backup for all communities. In addition to enforcing the law throughout the county, the office provides town police services under contract to Arden Hills, Falcon Heights, Little Canada, North Oaks, Shoreview, Vadnais Heights and White Bear Township. The Ramsey County Sheriff's office provides a number of unique services across the county as mandated by law. This includes detention for court and other court services. This also includes safety, rescue and law enforcement on the waterways. Proactively, the Sheriff's office provides multiple safety classes and coordinates community volunteer efforts. The office is responsible for the county jail, more officially the \"Adult Detention Center.\" The facility has a capacity of five hundred prisoners and a staff of about 150. {| class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\" |- ! style=\"background:#9cf;\"| Community !! style=\"background:#9cf;\"| Law Enforcement !! style=\"background:#9cf;\"| Fire Protection !! style=\"background:#9cf;\"| Ambulance |- |Arden Hills || Ramsey County Sheriff || Lake Johanna Fire || Allina Medical Transport |- |Falcon Heights || Ramsey County Sheriff || Saint Paul Fire || Saint Paul Fire |- |Gem Lake || White Bear Lake Police || White Bear Lake Fire || White Bear Lake Fire |- |Lauderdale || Saint Anthony Police || Saint Paul Fire || Saint Paul Fire |- |Little Canada || Ramsey County Sheriff || Little Canada Fire & Rescue || Allina Medical Transport |- |Maplewood || Maplewood Police || Maplewood Fire || Maplewood Fire |- |Minnesota State Fairgrounds || Minnesota State Fair Police || Saint Paul Fire || Saint Paul Fire |- |Mounds View || Mounds View Police || SBM Fire || Allina Medical Transport |- |New Brighton || New Brighton Police Division || New Brighton Fire Division || Allina Medical Transport |- |North Oaks || Ramsey County Sheriff || Lake Johanna Fire || Allina Medical Transport |- |North Saint Paul || North Saint Paul Police || North Saint Paul Fire || Lakeview Emergency Medical |- |Roseville || Roseville Police || Roseville Fire || Allina Medical Transport |- |Saint Anthony || Saint Anthony Police || Saint Anthony Fire || Hennepin EMS |- |Saint Paul || Saint Paul Police || Saint Paul Fire || Saint Paul Fire |- |Shoreview || Ramsey County Sheriff || Lake Johanna Fire || Allina Medical Transport |- |University of Minnesota-St. Paul || University Police || Saint Paul Fire || Saint Paul Fire |- |Vadnais Heights || Ramsey County Sheriff || Vadnais Heights Fire || Allina Medical Transport |- |White Bear Lake || White Bear Lake Police || White Bear Lake Fire || White Bear Lake Fire |- |White Bear Township || Ramsey County Sheriff || White Bear Lake Fire || White Bear Lake Fire |} ===County Attorney=== The Ramsey County Attorney prosecutes felony crimes which are committed within the jurisdiction of Ramsey County.
