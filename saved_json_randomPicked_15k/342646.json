For administrative purposes, they are essentially identical to national forests, except that grasslands are areas primarily consisting of prairie. Like national forests, national grasslands may be open for hunting, grazing, mineral extraction, recreation and other uses. Various national grasslands are typically administered in conjunction with nearby national forests. All but four national grasslands are on or at the edge of the Great Plains. Those four are in southeastern Idaho, northeastern California, central Oregon, and a reserve in Illinois. The three national grasslands in North Dakota, together with one in northwestern South Dakota, are administered jointly as the Dakota Prairie Grasslands. National grasslands are generally much smaller than national forests – while a typical national forest would be about , the average size of a national grassland is . The largest, the Little Missouri National Grassland in North Dakota, covers , which is approximately the median size of a national forest. As of September 30, 2007, the total area of all 20 national grasslands was . ==Soil Conservation Service== The catastrophic Dust Bowl of the 1930s led to the creation of the Soil Conservation Service in 1933.
