 "text": "King Kobra is an American heavy metal band founded by drummer Carmine Appice after his tenure with Ozzy Osbourne from 1983 to 1984. For their first two albums, the band consisted of four relatively unknown musicians: vocalist Marcie Free, guitarist David Michael-Philips, guitarist Mick Sweda, and bassist Johnny Rod. After two albums on Capitol Records—Ready to Strike (November 9, 1985) and Thrill of a Lifetime (1986)—and the independent release King Kobra III in 1988, Appice decided to dissolve the band and join guitarist John Sykes for his Blue Murder project in 1989. A new King Kobra emerged in 2010 with Carmine Appice on drums, Paul Shortino taking over vocal duties, Mick Sweda on guitar, David Henzerling (a.k.a. David Michael-Philips) on guitar, and Johnny Rod on bass. This lineup released the self-titled album King Kobra in 2011 on Frontiers Records and another album in 2013, titled King Kobra II. The band went on hiatus following the release of their 2013 album, largely due to the other commitments of the individual band members, They played live gigs again in 2016 without Mick Sweda. ==Members== === Current === *Paul Shortino – lead vocals, guitar (2010–present) *David Michael-Phillips – guitar, backing vocals, keyboards, synthesizers (1983–1989, 2010–present) *Johnny Rod – bass (1983–1986, 2010–present) *Carmine Appice – drums, backing vocals (1983–1989, 2000–2001, 2010-present) === Former === *Marcie Free – lead vocals (1983-November 1986) *Mike Wolf – guitar (1983) *Mick Sweda – guitar, backing vocals, synthesizers (1983–1987, 2000–2001, 2010–2016) *Marq Torien – lead vocals (1987) *Lonnie Vencent – bass (1986–1987) *Larry Hart – bass (1987–1989) *Jeff Northrup – guitar (1987–1989) *Johnny Edwards – lead vocals (1987–1989) *Kelly Keeling – bass, lead vocals, guitars, keyboards (2000–2001) *Steve Fister – guitar (2000–2001) ===Timeline=== ImageSize = width:1000 height:auto barincrement:22 PlotArea = left:125 bottom:90 top:10 right:15 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1983 till:01/01/2022 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Legend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:3 ScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1983 ScaleMajor = increment:2 start:1983 Colors = id:Vocals value:red legend:Vocals id:Guitar value:green legend:Guitar id:Keys value:purple legend:Keyboards id:Bass value:blue legend:Bass id:Drums value:orange legend:Drums id:Lines value:black legend:Studio_releases LineData = at:09/11/1985 color:black layer:back at:01/07/1986 color:black layer:back at:01/07/1988 color:black layer:back at:01/01/2001 color:black layer:back at:05/05/2011 color:black layer:back at:05/04/2013 color:black layer:back PlotData= width:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4) bar:Marcie Free from:start till:01/11/1986 color:Vocals bar:Marq Torien from:01/11/1986 till:01/07/1987 color:Vocals bar:Johnny Edwards from:01/07/1987 till:01/07/1989 color:Vocals bar:Paul Shortino from:01/07/2010 till:end color:Vocals bar:Paul Shortino from:01/07/2010 till:end color:Guitar width:3 bar:David Michael-Philips from:start till:01/07/1989 color:Guitar bar:David Michael-Philips from:start till:01/07/1989 color:Keys width:3 bar:David Michael-Philips from:01/07/2010 till:end color:Guitar bar:David Michael-Philips from:01/07/2010 till:end color:Keys width:3 bar:Mike Wolf from:start till:01/07/1983 color:Guitar bar:Mick Sweda from:01/07/1983 till:01/07/1987 color:Guitar bar:Mick Sweda from:01/07/1983 till:01/07/1987 color:Keys width:3 bar:Mick Sweda from:01/07/2000 till:01/07/2001 color:Guitar bar:Mick Sweda from:01/07/2000 till:01/07/2001 color:Keys width:3 bar:Mick Sweda from:01/07/2010 till:01/07/2016 color:Guitar bar:Mick Sweda from:01/07/2010 till:01/07/2016 color:Keys width:3 bar:Jeff Northrup from:01/07/1987 till:01/07/1989 color:Guitar bar:Steve Fister from:01/07/2000 till:01/07/2001 color:Guitar bar:Johnny Rod from:start till:01/07/1986 color:Bass bar:Johnny Rod from:01/07/2010 till:end color:Bass bar:Lonnie Vencent from:01/07/1986 till:01/07/1987 color:Bass bar:Larry Hart from:01/07/1987 till:01/07/1989 color:Bass bar:Kelly Keeling from:01/07/2000 till:01/07/2001 color:Bass bar:Kelly Keeling from:01/07/2000 till:01/07/2001 color:Guitar width:7 bar:Kelly Keeling from:01/07/2000 till:01/07/2001 color:Keys width:5 bar:Kelly Keeling from:01/07/2000 till:01/07/2001 color:Vocals width:3 bar:Carmine Appice from:start till:01/07/1989 color:Drums bar:Carmine Appice from:01/07/2000 till:01/07/2001 color:Drums bar:Carmine Appice from:01/07/2010 till:end color:Drums ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== *Ready to Strike (1985) *Thrill of a Lifetime (1986) *King Kobra III (1988) *Hollywood Trash (2001) *King Kobra (2011) *King Kobra II (2013) ===Compilation albums=== *The Lost Years (1999) *Number One (2005 - Re-release of The Lost Years) ==Movie soundtracks== *\"Iron Eagle (Never Say Die)\" was included in the soundtrack album from the 1986 movie Iron Eagle. **Song credits: Jake Hooker-Duane Hitchings - 1986 - Capitol Records. *\"Hunger\", covered by King Kobra but written by Kick Axe (listed as \"Spectre General\"), was featured in The Transformers: The Movie, and included on the soundtrack album. *\"Mean Street Machine\" & \"Redline\", were featured in RoadKill (video game) on radio station 69.3 QQQQ * ==Notes== * Rod left the band and joined W.A.S.P. in 1986. * Torien, Sweda, and Vincent left to play together in the band BulletBoys. * Free went on to form the bands known as Signal (EMI Records), and Unruly Child (Atlantic/Interscope Records).
