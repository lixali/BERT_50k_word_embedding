They chose to use a fixed-term, fixed-price model for IT consulting pricing projects, rather than charging on a time and materials basis. During this period, Sapient was also an early adopter of internet-based technology, and internet-based work grew to over 70% of total revenue by 1999. This led to rapid growth in the period from 1992 to 2000, with revenue growing from $950,000 to $503 million in that period. ===International expansion=== After a period of contraction following the dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s, Sapient looked overseas to grow a substantial portion of revenue, rising over 30% in 3 years. This growth was driven by a strategy called \"Global Distributed Delivery,\" which sought to capitalize on the quickly growing tech market in India to grow Sapient's software development capabilities. The operations in India would supplement project teams globally. Sapient has made numerous acquisitions throughout its history, beginning in 2006 with Planning Group International. Another important acquisition was DCG group in 2008, which augmented its existing capital markets offerings. In 2009, Sapient announced a $50 million acquisition of The Nitro Group, which added 300 employees. ===History of acquisitions=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" ! scope=\"col\"|Year ! scope=\"col\"|Name ! scope=\"col\"|Division ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Refs |- | 2016 | Vertiba | Sapient | |- | 2014 | Campfire | SapientNitro | |- | 2014 | OnPoint | Government Services | |- |2014 | The Community (aka La Comunidad) | SapientNitro | |- |2013 | iThink | SapientNitro | |- |2013 | (m)PHASIZE | SapientNitro | |- | 2012 | SecondStory | SapientNitro | |- |2011 | DAD | SapientNitro | |- |2011 | CLANMO | SapientNitro | |- |2009 | Nitro | SapientNitro | |- |2008 | Derivatives Consulting Group (DCG) | Global Markets | |- |2008 | iChameleon | Sapient | |- |2006 | Planning Group International (PGI) | Sapient | |- |2005 | Business Information Solutions | Sapient | |- |2000 | Human Code | Sapient | |- |2000 | The Launch Group | Sapient | |- |1999 | Adjacency | Sapient | |- |1999 | E-Lab | Sapient | |- |1998 | Studio Archetype | Sapient | |- |1997 | Exor | Sapient | |} ==Corporate affairs== In April 1996, Sapient went public with a price of $21 a share.
