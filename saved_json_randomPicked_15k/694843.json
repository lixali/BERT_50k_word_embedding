 "text": "In mathematics, particularly in algebraic topology, Alexander–Spanier cohomology is a cohomology theory for topological spaces. ==History== It was introduced by for the special case of compact metric spaces, and by for all topological spaces, based on a suggestion of Alexander D. Wallace. ==Definition== If X is a topological space and G is an R module where R is a ring with unity, then there is a cochain complex C whose p-th term C^p is the set of all functions from X^{p+1} to G with differential d\\colon C^{p-1} \\to C^{p} given by :df(x_0,\\ldots,x_p)= \\sum_i(-1)^if(x_0,\\ldots,x_{i-1},x_{i+1},\\ldots,x_p). The defined cochain complex C^*(X;G) does not rely on the topology of X. In fact, if X is a nonempty space, G\\simeq H^*(C^*(X;G)) where G is a graded module whose only nontrivial module is G at degree 0. An element \\varphi\\in C^p(X) is said to be locally zero if there is a covering \\\\{U\\\\} of X by open sets such that \\varphi vanishes on any (p+1)-tuple of X which lies in some element of \\\\{U\\\\} (i.e. \\varphi vanishes on \\bigcup_{U\\in\\\\{U\\\\}}U^{p+1}). The subset of C^p(X) consisting of locally zero functions is a submodule, denote by C_0^p(X). C^*_0(X) = \\\\{C_0^p(X),d\\\\} is a cochain subcomplex of C^*(X) so we define a quotient cochain complex \\bar{C}^*(X)=C^*(X)/C_0^*(X). The Alexander–Spanier cohomology groups \\bar{H}^p(X,G) are defined to be the cohomology groups of \\bar{C}^*(X). ===Induced homomorphism=== Given a function f:X\\to Y which is not necessarily continuous, there is an induced cochain map :f^\\sharp:C^*(Y;G)\\to C^*(X;G) defined by (f^\\sharp\\varphi)(x_0,...,x_p) = (\\varphi f)(x_0,...,x_p),\\ \\varphi\\in C^p(Y);\\ x_0,...,x_p\\in X If f is continuous, there is an induced cochain map :f^\\sharp:\\bar{C}^*(Y;G)\\to\\bar{C}^*(X;G) ===relative cohomology module=== If A is a subspace of X and i:A\\hookrightarrow X is an inclusion map, then there is an induced epimorphism i^\\sharp:\\bar{C}^*(X;G)\\to \\bar{C}^*(A;G). The kernel of i^\\sharp is a cochain subcomplex of \\bar{C}^*(X;G) which is denoted by \\bar{C}^*(X,A;G). If C^*(X,A) denote the subcomplex of C^*(X) of functions \\varphi that are locally zero on A, then \\bar{C}^*(X,A) = C^*(X,A)/C^*_0(X). The relative module is \\bar{H}^*(X,A;G) is defined to be the cohomology module of \\bar{C}^*(X,A;G) \\bar{H}^q(X,A;G) is called the Alexander cohomology module of (X,A) of degree q with coefficients G and this module satisfies all cohomology axioms. The resulting cohomology theory is called the Alexander (or Alexander-Spanier) cohomology theory ==Cohomology theory axioms== * (Dimension axiom) If X is a one-point space, G\\simeq \\bar{H}^*(X;G) * (Exactness axiom) If (X,A) is a topological pair with inclusion maps i:A\\hookrightarrow X and j:X\\hookrightarrow (X,A), there is an exact sequence \\cdots\\to\\bar{H}^q(X,A;G) \\xrightarrow{j^*} \\bar{H}^q(X;G)\\xrightarrow{i^*}\\bar{H}^q(A;G)\\xrightarrow{\\delta^*}\\bar{H}^{q+1}(X,A;G)\\to\\cdots * (Excision axiom) For topological pair (X,A), if U is an open subset of X such that \\bar{U}\\subset\\operatorname{int}A, then \\bar{C}^*(X,A)\\simeq \\bar{C}^*(X-U,A-U). * (Homotopy axiom) If f_0,f_1:(X,A)\\to(Y,B) are homotopic, then f_0^* = f_1^*:H^*(Y,B;G)\\to H^*(X,A;G) ==Alexander cohomology with compact supports== A subset B\\subset X is said to be cobounded if X-B is bounded, i.e. its closure is compact. Similar to the definition of Alexander cohomology module, one can define Alexander cohomology module with compact supports of a pair (X,A) by adding the property that \\varphi\\in C^q(X,A;G) is locally zero on some cobounded subset of X. Formally, one can define as follows : For given topological pair (X,A), the submodule C^q_c(X,A;G) of C^q(X,A;G) consists of \\varphi\\in C^q(X,A;G) such that \\varphi is locally zero on some cobounded subset of X. Similar to the Alexander cohomology module, one can get a cochain complex C^*_c(X,A;G) = \\\\{C^q_c(X,A;G),\\delta\\\\} and a cochain complex \\bar{C}^*_c(X,A;G) = C^*_c(X,A;G)/C_0^*(X;G). The cohomology module induced from the cochain complex \\bar{C}^*_c is called the Alexander cohomology of (X,A) with compact supports and denoted by \\bar{H}^*_c(X,A;G). Induced homomorphism of this cohomology is defined as the Alexander cohomology theory. Under this definition, we can modify homotopy axiom for cohomology to a proper homotopy axiom if we define a coboundary homomorphism \\delta^*:\\bar{H}^q_c(A;G)\\to \\bar{H}^{q+1}_c(X,A;G) only when A\\subset X is a closed subset. Similarly, excision axiom can be modified to proper excision axiom i.e. the excision map is a proper map. ===Property=== One of the most important property of this Alexander cohomology module with compact support is the following theorem * If X is locally compact Hausdorff space and X^+ is the one-point compactification of X, there is an isomorphism \\bar{H}^q_c(X;G)\\simeq \\tilde{\\bar{H}}^q(X^+;G) ===Example=== :\\bar{H}^q_c(\\R^n;G)\\simeq\\begin{cases} 0 & q eq n\\\\\\ G & q = n\\end{cases} as (\\R^n)^+\\cong S^n. Hence if n eq m, \\R^n and \\R^m are not of the same proper homotopy type. ==Relation with tautness== *From the fact that a closed subspace of a paracompact Hausdorff space is a taut subspace relative to the Alexander cohomology theory and the first Basic property of tautness, if B\\subset A\\subset X where X is a paracompact Hausdorff space and A and B are closed subspaces of X, then (A,B) is taut pair in X relative to the Alexander cohomology theory. Using this tautness property, one can show the following two facts * (Strong excision property) Let (X,A) and (Y,B) be pairs with X and Y paracompact Hausdorff and A and B closed. Let f:(X,A)\\to(Y,B) be a closed continuous map such that f induces a one-to-one map of X-A onto Y-B. Then for all q and all G, f^*:\\bar{H}^q(Y,B;G)\\xrightarrow{\\sim}\\bar{H}^q(X,A;G) * (Weak continuity property) Let \\\\{(X_\\alpha,A_\\alpha)\\\\}_\\alpha be a family of compact Hausdorff pairs in some space, directed downward by inclusion, and let (X,A) =(\\bigcap X_\\alpha,\\bigcap A_\\alpha). The inclusion maps i_\\alpha:(X,A)\\to (X_\\alpha,A_\\alpha) induce an isomoprhim :\\\\{i^*_\\alpha\\\\}:\\varinjlim\\bar{H}^q(X_\\alpha,A_\\alpha;M)\\xrightarrow{\\sim}\\bar{H}^q(X,A;M) ==Difference from singular cohomology theory== Recall that the singular cohomology module of a space is the direct product of the singular cohomology modules of its path components. A nonempty space X is connected if and only if G\\simeq \\bar{H}^0(X;G). Hence for any connected space which is not path connected, singular cohomology and Alexander cohomology differ in degree 0. If \\\\{U_j\\\\} is an open covering of X by pairwise disjoint sets, then there is a natural isomorphism \\bar{H}^q(X;G)\\simeq \\prod_j\\bar{H}^q(U_j;G). In particular, if \\\\{C_j\\\\} is the collection of components of a locally connected space X, there is a natural isomorphism \\bar{H}^q(X;G)\\simeq \\prod_j\\bar{H}^q(C_j;G) ===Variants=== It is also possible to define Alexander–Spanier homology and Alexander–Spanier cohomology with compact supports. ==Connection to other cohomologies== The Alexander–Spanier cohomology groups coincide with Čech cohomology groups for compact Hausdorff spaces, and coincide with singular cohomology groups for locally finite complexes. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * * Category:Cohomology theories Category:Duality theories",
