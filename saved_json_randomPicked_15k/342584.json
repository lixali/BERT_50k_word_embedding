 "text": "Shona (;Laurie Bauer, 2007, The Linguistics Student’s Handbook, Edinburgh ) is a Bantu language of the Shona people of Zimbabwe. It was codified by the colonial government in the 1950s. According to Ethnologue, Shona, comprising the Zezuru, Korekore and Karanga dialects, is spoken by about 7.5 million people. The Manyika and Ndau dialects of ShonaStabilization in the Manyika Dialect of the Shona Group, Hazel Carter, Africa: Journal of the International African Institute, Vol. 26, No. 4, Oct., 1956, pp. 398-405Report on the Unification of the Shona Dialects. By Clement M. Doke. 1931 are listed separately by Ethnologue, and are spoken by 1,025,000 and 2,380,000 people, respectively. The larger group of historically related languages—called Shona languages by linguists—also includes Ndau (Eastern Shona) and Kalanga (Western Shona). ==Instruction== thumb|Wikipedia in the Shona language. Shona is a written standard language with an orthography and grammar that was codified during the early 20th century and fixed in the 1950s. In the 1920s, the Rhodesian administration was faced with the challenge of preparing schoolbooks and other materials in the various languages and dialects and requested the recommendation of South African linguist Clement Doke. The first novel in Shona, Solomon Mutswairo's Feso, was published in 1957. Shona is taught in the schools, but is not the general medium of instruction in other subjects. It has a literature and is described through monolingual and bilingual dictionaries (chiefly Shona – English). Standard Shona is based on the dialect spoken by the Karanga people of Masvingo Province, the region around Great Zimbabwe, and Zezuru people of central and northern Zimbabwe. However, all Shona dialects are officially considered to be of equal significance and are taught in local schools. ==Classification== Shona is a member of the large family of Bantu languages. In Guthrie's zonal classification of Bantu languages, zone S.10 designates a dialect continuum of closely related varieties, including Zezuru, Karanga, Manyika, Ndau and Budya, spoken in Zimbabwe and central Mozambique; Tawara and Tewe, found in Mozambique; and Nambya and Kalanga in Botswana and Western Zimbabwe. ==Dialects== Shona is used to refer to a standardised language based on the central dialects of the Shona region. Shona languages form a dialect continuum from the Kalahari desert in the west to the Indian Ocean in the east and the Limpopo river in the south and the Zambezi in the north. While the languages are related, evolution and separation over the past 1000 years has meant that mutual intelligibility is not always possible without a period of acculturation. Therefore, Central Shona speakers have a difficult time understanding Kalanga speakers even though lexical sharing can be over 80% with some western Karanga dialects. In the same manner eastern dialects (Shanga) spoken along the Indian Ocean are also very divergent. There are many dialect differences in Shona, but a standardized dialect is recognized. According to information from Ethnologue (when excluding S16 Kalanga): * S14 Karanga dialect (Chikaranga). Spoken in southern Zimbabwe, near Masvingo. It is also mostly spoken in the Midlands province, most notably in Mberengwa and Zvishavane districts. :Subdialects: Duma, Jena, Mhari (Mari), Ngova, Venda (not the Venda language), Nyubi (spoken in Matabeleland at the beginning of the colonial period is now extinct), Govera. * S12 Zezuru dialect (Chizezuru, Bazezuru, Bazuzura, Mazizuru, Vazezuru, Wazezuru). Spoken in Mashonaland east and central Zimbabwe, near Harare. The standard language. :Subdialects: Shawasha, Gova, Mbire, Tsunga, Kachikwakwa, Harava, Nohwe, Njanja, Nobvu, Kwazvimba (Zimba). * S11 Korekore dialect (Northern Shona, Goba, Gova, Shangwe). Spoken in northern Zimbabwe, Mvurwi, Bindura, Mt Darwin, Guruve, Chiweshe, Centenary. :Subdialects: Gova, Tande, Tavara, Nyongwe, Pfunde, Shan Gwe. Languages with partial intelligibility with Shona, of which the speakers are considered to be ethnically Shona, are the S15 Ndau language, spoken in Mozambique and Zimbabwe, and the S13 Manyika language, spoken in eastern Zimbabwe, near Mutare specifically Chipinge. Ndau literacy material has been introduced into primary schools. Maho (2009) recognizes Korekore, Zezuru, Manyika, Karanga, and Ndau as distinct languages within the Shona cluster, with Kalanga being more divergent. ==Phonology and alphabet== All syllables in Shona end in a vowel. Consonants belong to the next syllable. For example, mangwanani (\"morning\") is syllabified as ma.ngwa.na.ni; \"Zimbabwe\" is zi.mba.bwe. No silent letters are used in Shona.https://wikitravel.org/en/Shona_phrasebook === Vowels === Shona's five vowels are pronounced as in Spanish: . Each vowel is pronounced separately even if they fall in succession. For example, \"Unoenda kupi?\" (Where do you go?) is pronounced . Vowels in Shona always make the same sound.https://wikitravel.org/en/Shona_phrasebook ===Consonants=== The consonant sounds of Shona are: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | ! rowspan=\"2\" |Bilabial ! rowspan=\"2\" |Labio- dental ! colspan=\"2\" |Alveolar ! rowspan=\"2\" |Palatal ! rowspan=\"2\" |Velar ! rowspan=\"2\" |Glottal |- !plain !whistled |- ! rowspan=\"4\" |Plosive !voiceless | | | | | | | |- !breathy | | | | | | | |- !implosive | | | | | | | |- !prenasalized | | | | | | | |- ! rowspan=\"3\" |Affricate !voiceless | | | | | | | |- !breathy | | | | | | | |- !prenasalized | | | | | | | |- ! rowspan=\"3\" |Fricative !voiceless | | | | | | | |- !breathy | | | | | | | |- !prenasalized | | | | | | | |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |Nasal !plain | | | | | | | |- !breathy | | | | | | | |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Trill | | | | | | | |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Approximant | | | | | | | |} Shona has two tones, a high and a low tone, but these tones are not indicated in spelling. ===Whistled sibilants=== Shona and other languages of Southern and Eastern Africa include whistling sounds, (this should not be confused with whistled speech). Shona's whistled sibilants are the fricatives \"sv\" and \"zv\" and the affricates \"tsv\" and \"dzv\". {| class=wikitable !Sound !! example !! translation || notes |- !rowspan=2|sv |masvosvobwa||\"shooting stars\" |rowspan=2|\"sv\" can be represented by S͎, from the Extensions to the International Phonetic Alphabet |- |masvosve||\"ants\" |- !tsv |tsvaira||\"sweep\" ||(Standard Shona) |- !svw |masvavembasvi||\"schemer\" ||(Shangwe, Korekore dialect) |- !zv |zvizvuvhutswa||\"gold nuggets\" ||(Tsunga, Zezuru dialect) |- !dzv |akadzva||\"he/she was unsuccessful\" || |- !zvw |huzvweverere||\"emotions\" ||(Gova, Korekore dialect) |- !nzv |nzvenga||\"to dodge\" ||(Standard Shona) |- !zvc | muzvcazi||\"the Milky Way\"||rowspan=2|Dental clicks.

The BBC Pronunciation Unit recommended the pronunciation \"chang-girr-ayi\" . ===Special characters=== *' - the apostrophe can be used after the character \"n\" to create a sound similar to the \"-ng\" from the English word \"ping\".

This included these letters: :ɓ (b with hook), :ɗ (d with hook), :ŋ (n with leg), :ȿ (s with swash tail), :ʋ (v with hook), :ɀ (z with swash tail). In 1955, these were replaced by letters or digraphs from the basic Latin alphabet. For example, today or is used for and or is used for . ==Grammar== Noun classes (mupanda) Mupanda, or noun class, is the way in which Shona words are grouped: # Zvaanoreva (\"their meanings\") e.g. words found in mupanda 1 and 2 describe a person: munhu (\"person\") is in mupanda 1 and musikana (\"girl\") is in mupanda 2. # Uwandu neushoma (\"singular and plural form\") e.g. words found in mupanda 8 are plurals of mupanda 7: zvikoro (\"schools\") in mupanda 8 is a plural form of chikoro (\"school\") in mupanda 7. # Sungawirirano (accordance) words in mupanda 5 have sungawirirano -ri- e.g. garwe iri (\"this crocodile\"), dombo iri (\"this stone\"), gudo iri (\"this baboon\"); 'iri' means 'this'. # Chivakashure (\"prefix\") e.g. words in mupanda 1 have prefix mu-, mupanda 8 zvi-, mupanda 10 dzi-, mupanda 11 ru-, etc. #Empty prefix units refer to words that do not require a prefix There are 21 mupanda. Mupanda 20 was omitted because it is considered vulgar. {| class=\"wikitable\" !colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"|Noun class !rowspan=\"2\"|Muenzaniso weIzwi (\"word example\") !colspan=\"2\"|Word construction Prefix+body=word !rowspan=\"2\"|English translation |- !Prefix !Body |- |1 |mu |mukomana |mu- |-komana |\"boy\" |- |1a | – |baba | |-baba |\"father\" |- |2 |va |vakomana |va- |-komana |\"boys\" |- |2a |va |vasahwira |va- |-sahwira |\"best friend\" |- |2a |vana |vanatezvara |vana- |-tezvara |\"father-in-law\" |- |2b |a |atete |a- |-tete |\"aunt\" |- |3 |mu |muti |mu- |-ti |\"tree\" |- |4 |mi |miti |mi- |-ti |\"trees\" |- |5 |ri |rize |ri- |-ze |\"scorpion\" |- |6 |ma |marize |ma- |-ze |\"scorpions\" |- |7 |chi |chingwa |chi- |-ngwa |\"bread\" |- |8 |zvi |zvingwa |zvi- |-ngwa |\"bread\" |- |9 |i |imba |i- |-mba |\"house\" |- |10 |dzi |dzimba |dzi- |-mba |\"houses\" |- |11 |ru |rwizi |ru- |-izi |\"river\" |- |12 |ka |kambwa |ka- |-mbwa |\"that little dog\" |- |13 |tu |tumbwa |tu- |-mbwa |\"those little dogs\" |- |14 |u |upfu |u- |-pfu |\"mealie meal\" |- |15 |ku |kuenda |ku- |-enda |\"going\" |- |16 |pa |pamba |pa- |-mba |\"home\" |- |17 |ku |kumusha |ku- |-musha |\"rural home\" |- |17a | – |zasi | |-zasi |\"below\" |- |18 |mu |mumunda |mu- |-munda |\"in the farm\" |- |19 |svi |svimbudzi |svi- |-mbudzi |\"goat\" |- |21 |zi |zigomana |zi- |-gomana |\"big boy\" |} == See also == * Shona calendar ==References== ==Bibliography== * Biehler, E.
