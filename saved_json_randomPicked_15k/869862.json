It is about young and carefree London aristocrats and bohemians, set in the interwar period.

Her last release of 2003 was Young Adam, in which she plays the girlfriend of a cruel barge worker (Ewan McGregor). Based on the novel of the same title, Mortimer's role in Young Adam garnered her acclaim; Evening Standard's critic wrote, \"In a performance of naked courage, Emily Mortimer shows that she is prepared to go to extreme lengths of masochism in her depiction of a woman undone by love\". Sight & Sound magazine thought the cast performances were \"edgy\", and Mortimer made the most out of an underwritten role. She also had a supporting part in the romantic drama The Sleeping Dictionary (2003). In 2004, Mortimer played the lead role in the drama Dear Frankie, about a young mother whose love for her son prompts her to plan a deception to protect him from the truth about his father. Her performance gained positive reviews; San Francisco Chronicle wrote, \"an unforgettable performance from Mortimer [...] a leading lady\". Matthew Leyland of the BBC gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, and was impressed with Mortimer's performance, which was played with \"heartfelt conviction\". In an interview with critic Roger Ebert, Mortimer said, \"I seem to find characters who are held back and guarded, physically and mentally. It's a relief after the film is over. [...] But when I'm acting, it's good to have something to play against, boundaries to break.\" Mortimer also voiced young Sophie in the English-dubbed version of 2004's Howl's Moving Castle. In 2005, she played Chloe Wilton, the oblivious spouse of Jonathan Rhys Meyers's adulterer in Woody Allen's Match Point. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, and co-starred Scarlett Johansson, and Matthew Goode.

Critical reception was mostly mixed, and Ruthe Stein of San Francisco Chronicle thought Mortimer and Reynolds lacked chemistry. The psychological thriller Transsiberian (2008), directed by Brad Anderson, saw Mortimer cast as Jessie. She co-stars with Woody Harrelson, and they portray a couple who befriend a pair of mysterious travellers.

A year later, she was cast in David Mamet's martial arts drama Redbelt, playing attorney Laura Black.

The plot follows widowed veteran (Michael Caine), who takes the law into his own hands when teenage violence ruin his community. Mortimer chose the role because \"It felt like unfamiliar territory for me which is always a challenge and interesting [...] the script is very gripping and brilliantly written [...] getting to work with Michael, and then just the character being in some ways both the opposite and the same as Michael's character.\" To prepare for the role, she spent time with a real female detective, and learnt about police interrogation techniques. Upon release, the critic from USA Today thought her performance was \"caring and savvy\", despite the film's \"senseless violence\". Betsy Sharkey of Los Angeles Times wrote of Mortimer's performance: \"Her clinical coolness plays well off of Caine's controlled heat.\" Mortimer played an aspiring actress opposite Andy García in City Island (2009). Although the film's reception was warm, her role in City Island was noted by two critics as \"vague\" and weak. She appeared as Rachel Solando in Martin Scorsese's 2010 thriller Shutter Island.

A family drama, about a man with Alzheimer's, Head Full of Honey (2018), was Mortimer's next release. She played the wife of Matt Dillon's character.

It co-stars Grace Van Patten as Lilian, a young woman who moves in with her father's friend, a reclusive novelist called Julia Price (Mortimer). Of her character, she said, \"I wish I had just one per cent of Julia's frostiness in my own life. I really enjoyed being that person, feeling what it's like to be intimidating.\" The film was made by Mortimer's friend, Dolly Wells, in her directorial debut. The actor's performance earned praise, but several critics were disappointed with her amount of screen time. Next, she appeared in Greg Kinnear's comedy Phil; it was negatively received by critics. In the horror film Mary, Mortimer starred opposite Gary Oldman. The film is about a family in isolated waters and the ship they bought which has terrifying secrets.
