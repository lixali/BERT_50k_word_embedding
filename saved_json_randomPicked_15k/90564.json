It was created from part of the former province of Normandy. The name in fact is taken from the Eure river flowing mainly in this department. After the allied victory at Waterloo, Eure was occupied by Prussian troops between June 1815 and November 1818. In the wake of Louis-Napoléons December coup of 1851, Eure was one of the departments placed under a state of emergency in order to avert resistance to the post-republican régime. In the event fewer than 100 government opponents in Eure were arrested.Jacques Olivier Boudon, Les Bonaparte : regards sur la France impériale. La Documentation photographique, dossier 8073, janvier-février 2010, p. 11 (carte de Gilles Pécout) == Geography == Eure is part of the current region of Normandy and is surrounded by the departments of Seine-Maritime, Oise, Val-d'Oise, Yvelines, Eure-et- Loir, Orne, and Calvados. The department is a largely wooded plateau intersected by the valleys of the Seine River and its tributaries. The altitude varies from sea level in the north to 248 metres above it in the south. ==Politics== The President of the General Council is Jean-Louis Destans of the Socialist Party. {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" |- style=\"background- color:#E9E9E9; border-bottom: 2px solid gray;\" !colspan=2| Party || seats |- ! style=\"background-color: \" |• |Socialist Party ||align=\"right\"| 12 |- ! style=\"background-color: \" | |Union for a Popular Movement ||align=\"right\"| 11 |- ! style=\"background-color: \" |• |Miscellaneous Left ||align=\"right\"| 7 |- ! style=\"background-color: \" |• |French Communist Party ||align=\"right\"| 4 |- ! style=\"background-color: \" | |Miscellaneous Right ||align=\"right\"| 4 |- ! style=\"background-color: \" | |New Centre ||align=\"right\"| 3 |- ! style=\"background-color: \" |• |Left Radical Party ||align=\"right\"| 2 |- |} ===Current National Assembly Representatives=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=\"2\"|Constituency!!Memberhttp://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/!!Party |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | Eure's 1st constituency | Séverine Gipson | La République En Marche! |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | Eure's 2nd constituency | Fabien Gouttefarde | La République En Marche! |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | Eure's 3rd constituency | Marie Tamarelle- Verhaeghe | La République En Marche! |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | Eure's 4th constituency | Bruno Questel | La République En Marche! |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | Eure's 5th constituency | Claire O'Petit | La République En Marche! |} == Tourism == The main tourist attraction is Giverny ( from Vernon) where Claude Monet's house and garden can be seen, as well as other places of interest (see external links, below).
