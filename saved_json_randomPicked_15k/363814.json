 "text": "This list of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) lists institutions of higher education in the United States that were established before 1964 with the intention of primarily serving the black community. Alabama leads the nation with the number of HBCUs, followed by North Carolina then Georgia. The list of closed colleges includes many that, because of state laws, were \"racially\" segregated. In other words, those colleges are not just \"historically\" black, they were entirely black for as long as they existed. ==Current institutions== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 100 |- !

Nothing came of the negotiations, however, and Avery College never reopened.
