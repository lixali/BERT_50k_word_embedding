 "text": "Rally Trophy is a 2001 historic PC rally simulation, developed by Bugbear Entertainment and published by JoWooD Productions for the Microsoft Windows operating system in 2001. ==Reception== Rally Trophy received \"favorable\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The Finnish gaming magazine Pelit summarized that \"Rally Trophy sets the standard for all future driving games. The graphics are absolutely stunning and the lack of inspiring game modes is compensated by the sheer thrill of driving cars that behave uniquely and realistically. A must-have for all rally fans\". IGN summarized that \"Rally Trophy is a superb game that offers an unusual alternative to the more technology packed offerings like McRae and Pro Rally\". Several critics compared the game to Grand Prix Legends including Pelit, IGN and GameSpot. GameSpot presented Rally Trophy with its annual \"Best Driving Game on PC\" award. The game was a nominee for PC Gamer USs \"2002 Best Racing Game\" award, which ultimately went to NASCAR Racing 2002 Season. The game sold over 650.000 copies. ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2001 video games Category:Cancelled Xbox games Category:Off-road racing video games Category:Rally racing video games Category:Video games developed in Finland Category:Video games scored by Jonne Valtonen Category:Video games set in Finland Category:Video games set in Kenya Category:Video games set in Russia Category:Video games set in Sweden Category:Video games set in Switzerland Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:JoWooD Entertainment games Category:Bugbear Entertainment games",
