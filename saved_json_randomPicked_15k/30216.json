 "text": "300px|thumb|Nations with which Turkmenistan has diplomatic relations. Turkmenistan's declaration of \"permanent neutrality\" was formally recognized by the United Nations in 1995. Former President Niyazov stated that the neutrality would prevent Turkmenistan from participating in multi-national defense organizations, but allows military assistance. Its neutral foreign policy has an important place in the country's constitution. Although the Government of Turkmenistan claims to favour trade with and export to the United States and Turkey, its single largest commercial partner is China, which buys the vast bulk of Turkmen natural gas via the Central Asia–China gas pipeline. Turkmenistan has significant commercial relationships with Russia and Iran and growing cross-border trade with Afghanistan. The Government of Turkmenistan often appears to use the conflicting interests of these regional powers as a means to extract concessions, especially on energy issues. ==International disputes== Signing of the Caspian Sea convention in 2018 brought only partial resolution of boundary disputes in the Caspian. Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan have disputes over water-sharing. Turkmenistan shares a long border with Afghanistan, a principal producer of heroin and opium. As a result, a large volume of narcotics are trafficked through Turkmenistan on their way to lucrative markets in Europe and Russia. ==Natural resources== Turkmenistan is rich in natural gas, and currently sells most of its gas to China. Turkmenistan unilaterally cut off exports of pipeline natural gas to Iran in 2017 over a payment arrears dispute. Russia ceased buying gas from Turkmenistan in 2016, but resumed small purchases of pipeline gas in 2019. Afghanistan buys liquid petroleum gas, shipped by rail to Ymamnazar and Torghundi for onward delivery by truck. Turkmenistan is a partner country of the EU INOGATE energy programme, which has four key topics: enhancing energy security, convergence of member state energy markets on the basis of EU internal energy market principles, supporting sustainable energy development, and attracting investment for energy projects of common and regional interest. ==Organisations== Turkmenistan is a member of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Economic Cooperation Organization, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the Islamic Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the International Organization of Turkic Culture. Turkmenistan maintains permanent representatives to the United Nations offices in New York City, Vienna, and Geneva. The United Nations maintains a permanent representation staffed by a resident coordinator along with representatives of some UN agencies in Ashgabat. The Asian Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and European Union have missions in Ashgabat, as well. == Diplomatic relations == List of countries which Turkmenistan has diplomatic relations with: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !# !Country !Date |- |1 | | |- |2 | | |- |3 | | |- |4 | | |- |5 | | |- |6 | | |- |7 | | |- |8 | | |- |9 | | |- |10 | | |- |11 | | |- |12 | | |- |13 | | |- |14 | | |- |15 | | |- |16 | | |- |17 | | |- |18 | | |- |19 | | |- |20 | | |- |– | | |- |21 | | |- |22 | | |- |23 | | |- |24 | | |- |25 | | |- |26 | | |- |27 | | |- |28 | | |- |29 | | |- |30 | | |- |31 | | |- |32 | | |- |33 | | |- |34 | | |- |35 | | |- |36 | | |- |37 | | |- |38 | | |- |39 | | |- |40 | | |- |41 | | |- |42 | | |- |43 | | |- |44 | | |- |45 | | |- |46 | | |- |47 | | |- |48 | | |- |49 | | |- |50 | | |- |51 | | |- |52 | | |- |53 | | |- |54 | | |- |55 | | |- |56 | | |- |57 | | |- |58 | | |- |59 | | |- |60 | | |- |61 | | |- |62 | | |- |63 | | |- |64 | | |- |65 | | |- |66 | | |- |67 | | |- |68 | | |- |69 | | |- |70 | | |- |71 | | |- |72 | | |- |73 | | |- |74 | | |- |75 | | |- |76 | | |- |77 | | |- |78 | | |- |79 | | |- |80 | | |- |81 | | |- |82 | | |- |83 | | |- |84 | | |- |85 | | |- |86 | | |- |87 | | |- |88 | | |- |89 | | |- |90 | | |- |91 | | |- |92 | | |- |93 | | |- |94 | | |- |95 | | |- |– | | |- |96 | | |- |97 | | |- |98 | | |- |99 | | |- |100 | | |- |101 | | |- |102 | | |- |103 | | |- |104 | | |- |105 | | |- |106 | | |- |107 | | |- |108 | | |- |109 | | |- |110 | | |- |111 | | |- |112 | | |- |113 | | |- |114 | | |- |115 | | |- |116 | | |- |117 | | |- |118 | | |- |119 | | |- |120 | | |- |121 | | |- |– | | |- |122 | | |- |123 | | |- |124 | | |- |125 | | |- |126 | | |- |127 | | |- |128 | | |- |129 | | |- |130 | | |- |131 | | |- |132 | | |- |133 | | |- |134 | | |- |135 | | |- |136 | | |- |137 | | |- |138 | | |- |139 | | |- |140 | | |- |141 | | |- |142 | | |- |143 | | |- |144 | | |- |145 | | |- |146 | | |- |147 | | |- |148 | | |} ==Bilateral relations== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\" |- ! style=\"width:15%;\"| Country ! style=\"width:12%;\"| Formal Relations Began !Notes |- valign=\"top\" |||21 February 1992|| Afghanistan has an embassy in Ashgabat and a consulate in Mary. Turkmenistan has an embassy in Kabul plus consulates in Herat and Mazar- i-Sharif. The rise of India as an economic giant and its increasing energy needs make Turkmenistan and Central Asia energy markets of choice for that country and also China. The Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline (TAPI) has been one of the most important regional initiatives to be undertaken by these countries. The agreement to build the pipeline to transport Turkmen gas to Afghanistan and Pakistan and beyond to India was signed in 2010. In addition, Afghanistan depends on Turkmenistan for meeting a large part of the country's electricity needs. At present, Afghanistan imports more than 320 million kilowatt hours of electricity every year from Turkmenistan. In 2011, Turkmenistan agreed to build a 150-km extension to a railway line to connect the rail line to Serhetabat to Andkhoy in Faryab province, Afghanistan. In February 2018, the existing rail line between Serhetabat and Torghundi in Afghanistan was restored to service. This line is planned to be extended to Herat, where it could potentially connect to a rail line under construction from Khaf, Iran. The line to Andkhoy went into service in January 2021. In 2013, work began on a link from Kerki via Ymamnazar on the Turkmen-Afghan border to Aqina in Andkhoy District. This link was opened in November 2016. It was extended 38 km to Andkhoy in January 2021, and is intended eventually to become part of a railway corridor through northern Afghanistan, linking it via Sherkhan Bandar, Mazar-i-Sharif and Kunduz to Tajikistan. As of 1 April 2011, there were 44 enterprises with Afghan assets in Turkmenistan. |- valign=\"top\" |||24 March 1994|| Both countries established diplomatic relations on March 24, 1994. |- valign=\"top\" |||9 October 1992||See Armenia–Turkmenistan relations * Formal relations were established in 1992 * Armenia has an embassy in Ashgabat. * Turkmenistan has an embassy in Yerevan. * Both countries are full members of the Organization for Security and Co- operation in Europe. * There are between 30,000 and 44,000 people of Armenian descent living in Turkmenistan. |- valign=\"top\" |||16 October 1992||See Austria–Turkmenistan relations Turkmenistan has an embassy in Vienna, which doubles as the permanent mission to United Nations agencies in Vienna. |- valign=\"top\" |||9 June 1992|| The two countries have embassies in each other's capitals.
