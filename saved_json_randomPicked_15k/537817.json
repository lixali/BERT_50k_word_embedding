 "text": "The Kassel World War II bombings were a set of Allied strategic bombing attacks which took place from February 1942 to March 1945. In a single deadliest raid on 22–23 October 1943, 150,000 inhabitants were bombed-out, at least 6,000 people died, the vast majority of the city center was destroyed, and the fire of the most severe air raid burned for seven days. The US First Army captured Kassel on 3 April 1945, where only 50,000 inhabitants remained, versus 236,000 in 1939. ==Targets== thumb|Bomb damaged buildings in Kassel, Untere Königsstraße As well as being the capital of the provinces of Hesse- Nassau and Kurhessen, Kassel had some important targets: *Fieseler aircraft plant *Henschel & Sohn facilities, maker of the Tiger I and King Tiger heavy tanks * The Henschel & Sohn firm's locomotive plant * engine plant * motor transport plant * railway works * Military HQs at Wehrkreis IX, and Bereich Hauptsitz Kassel * Central Germany HQ, highway & railway construction * Regional Supreme Court ==Bombing raids== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+Bombing raids on Kassel during World War II !style= width=20% | Date !style= width=18% | Target !style= | |- | | | 12px 10 Wellingtons and 3 Stirlings to Emden, Hamburg, Kassel and Aachen. |- | | Henschel | 12px 306 aircraft destroyed/seriously damaged 144/317 buildings, particularly in the city southwest.
