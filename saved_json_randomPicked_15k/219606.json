It was the first time freestyle wrestling was featured, as the first Olympic wrestling contests had been in the Greco-Roman style. Weight classes also made their first appearance. The sport would continue to be in the Olympic program to present day. 100px|border|Wrestling ==Medal summary== {| |- |Light flyweight | | | |- |Flyweight | | | |- |Bantamweight | | | |- ||Featherweight | | | |- |Lightweight | | | |- ||Welterweight | | | |- ||Heavyweight | | | |} ==Participating nations== right|thumb|300px|Wrestling match during 1904 Summer Olympics. A total of 42 wrestlers competed at the St. Louis Games: * * * * The nationalities of many medalists are disputed, as many American competitors were recent immigrants to the United States who had not yet been granted US citizenship. The International Olympic Committee considers Norwegian-American wrestlers Charles Ericksen and Bernhoff Hansen to have competed for the United States. Each man won a gold medal. In 2012, Norwegian historians however found documentation showing that Ericksen did not receive American citizenship until March 22, 1905, and that Hansen probably never received American citizenship. The historians have therefore petitioned the IOC to have the athletes registered as Norwegians. In May 2013, it was reported that the Norwegian Olympic Committee had filed a formal application for changing the nationality of the wrestlers in the IOC's medal database. In July 2021 IOC modified data at olympic database, recognized Ericksen and Hansen as Norwegians. Likewise, IOC recognized Gustav Thiefenthaler as a Swiss, and Frank Kugler as German. ==Medal table== ==Notes== ==References== * International Olympic Committee medal database Category:1904 Summer Olympics events 1904",
