 "text": "The Executive Council of Ontario (), often informally referred to as the Cabinet of Ontario (), is the cabinet of the Canadian province of Ontario. It comprises ministers of the provincial Crown, who are selected by the premier of Ontario (the first minister of the Crown) and appointed by the lieutenant governor. The activities of the Government of Ontario are directed by the Executive Council. The Executive Council is almost always made up of members of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Though the lieutenant governor does not generally attend Cabinet meetings, directives issued by the Crown on the advice of the ministers are said to be ordered by the Lieutenant Governor-in- Council. Ministers hold the honorific prefix \"The Honourable\" while members of the council. The Cabinet is similar in structure and role to the federal Privy Council for Canada, though smaller in size, and, whereas the federal Cabinet is actually a committee of the Privy Council, the Executive Council of Ontario and Cabinet of Ontario are one and the same. Also, unlike the Privy Council, members of the Ontario Executive Council are not appointed for life, and are not entitled to post-nominal letters. ==Current Cabinet== Doug Ford and his Cabinet were sworn in by Lieutenant Governor Elizabeth Dowdeswell on June 29, 2018, following the 2018 general election.
