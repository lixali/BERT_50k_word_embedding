Overman became involved in politics and was first elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives. In 1914, Overman became the first U.S. Senator from North Carolina to be elected by popular vote, after passage of the 17th Amendment to the Constitution in 1913 standardized popular election of senators. This was the beginning of his time when he was elected for a second term after his first term of six years had expired. In 1902 and 1909, Overman had been appointed to the Senate seat by the state legislature. The biggest reforms that Overman was in favor of were corporate interests and labor reform. Overman’s economic policies made him lean toward the progressive side.Daniel R.

After the war the senator was active in the investigation of German and Bolshevik propaganda and played a role in bringing on the first Red Scare that plagued American politics in 1919 and 1920. This was after the first World War when many innocent men and women were being called in and taken away from their jobs and lives and brought in for questioning and even jailed at some points.Daniel R.

He wanted to keep the Red Scare contained so people would not catch wind of it and live in fear. He wrote and sponsored the Overman Act of 1918, which gave President Woodrow Wilson extraordinary powers to coordinate government agencies in wartime. Overman chaired a Senate committee after World War I to investigate activities during the first Red Scare, which many see as a precursor to the House Un-American Activities Committee. In 1922, Overman was one of the leaders of a 1-hour, 45 minute filibuster that helped defeat the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill. In his lengthy speech, he said that the bill was a partisan attempt to solidify the Republican hold on the northern black vote, that the bill had been written by a black person, and that ignorant black people in the South would interpret the bill as permission to \"commit the foulest of outrages.\"\"Filibuster Kills Anti-Lynching Bill\", New York Times, December 3, 1922 ==Overman Committee== Overman chaired the Overman Committee, a subcommittee that investigated foreign propaganda and Bolshevism in the United States during the first Red Scare from 1919 to 1921. He was chosen to head the commission called the Overman Committee by President Woodrow Wilson. After the war the senator was active in the investigation of German and Bolshevik propaganda and played a role in bringing on the so-called Red Scare that plagued American politics in 1919 and 1920 (Beaver). ==See also== *List of United States Congress members who died in office (1900–49) ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Category:1854 births Category:1930 deaths Category:Members of the North Carolina House of Representatives Category:United States senators from North Carolina Category:Duke University Trinity College of Arts and Sciences alumni Category:North Carolina Democrats Category:Anti-communism in the United States Category:Democratic Party United States senators Category:People from Salisbury, North Carolina Category:American anti-communists",
