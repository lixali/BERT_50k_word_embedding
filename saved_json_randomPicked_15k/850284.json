 "text": "The Wigan by-election of 23 September 1999 was held after the death of the incumbent Labour MP, Roger Stott. The by-election was contested by nine candidates in total, with Labour selecting Neil Turner, who had been a local councillor for 27 years, to defend the seat. Meanwhile, the Conservatives chose Tom Peet, who was an active Trade Unionist and had worked at a nearby coal mine. The result was a hold for the Labour Party, with Turner gaining 59.6% of the vote, in spite of a 5% swing to the Conservative Party. ==Result of the by-election== ==Result of the previous general election== ==References== Category:By-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Greater Manchester constituencies Category:Elections in the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan Category:1999 elections in the United Kingdom Category:1999 in England Category:1990s in Greater Manchester Category:September 1999 events in the United Kingdom",
