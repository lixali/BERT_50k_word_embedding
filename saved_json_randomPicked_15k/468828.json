It is located in the southern part of the country (Upper Egypt), and covers a stretch of the Nile Valley. Since 1960, its capital has been the city of Sohag. Prior to that, the capital was the city of Girga and the name of the governorate was Girga Governorate. == Overview == The rate of poverty is more than 60% in this governorate but recently some social safety networks have been provided in the form of financial assistance and job opportunities. The funding has been coordinated by the country's Ministry of Finance and with assistance from international organizations. In early 2019, some residents of the poorer villages of Sohag were able to move into their new homes built, in part, with aid from the National Bank of Kuwait. There was a celebration for the completion of 115 homes where residents also received cattle and other gifts. ==Archaeology== In April 2019, the archaeological mission of the Ministry of Antiquities led by Mostafa Waziri uncovered a tomb of a nobleman called Toutou and his wife at Al-Dayabat archaeological site dating back to the Ptolemaic era. The tomb contained two tiny rooms with two limestone sarcophagi. Besides, well preserved mummy, mummified animals and birds including falcons, eagles, cats, dogs and shrews were also revealed in the tomb. ==Municipal divisions== The governorate is divided into municipal divisions with a total estimated population as of July 2017 of 4,995,155. In the case of Sohag governorate, there are two new cities, five agsam and twelve marakiz. In some instances there is a markaz and a kism with the same name. {| class=\"sortable wikitable plainrowheaders\" |+ Municipal Divisions ! Anglicized name !! Native name !! Arabic transliteration !!
