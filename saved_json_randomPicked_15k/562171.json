This usage is most often employed to compare English- and French-language literature, media, art and institutions. #When discussing the Two Solitudes, in which English Canada (i.e. the anglophones of Canada) is one of two founding nations of Canada along with French Canada (i.e. the francophones of Canada), and in which these two societies share a country but rarely communicate with each other.
