 "text": "The 2002 NBA draft was held on June 26, 2002, at The Theater at Madison Square Garden. In this draft, National Basketball Association (NBA) teams took turns selecting 57 amateur college basketball players and other first-time eligible players, such as players from non-North American leagues.NBA.com: 2002 Draft Handbook This was the last draft that was broadcast on TNT, as ESPN secured rights to air the 2003 draft. The NBA announced that about 42 college and high school players, and five international players, had filed as early-entry candidates for the draft.NBA.com. Twenty-Four Early Entry Candidates Withdraw from Draft 2002. Retrieved June 26, 2007. The Chicago Bulls and the Golden State Warriors each had a 22.5% chance of acquiring the first pick, but the Houston Rockets, with just an 8.9% probability, won the NBA draft lottery on May 19.NBA.com. Ties Broken for NBA Draft Order of Selection. April 24, 2002. Retrieved June 26, 2007. The Bulls and Warriors were second and third, respectively. As punishment for salary-cap violations during the 2000–01 season, the Minnesota Timberwolves forfeited their first-round draft pick. The 2002 draft set a record of 17 international selections, with six of them coming in the first round.Lago, Joe. Draft record set with 17 foreign-born picks. June 26, 2002. Retrieved June 26, 2002. Number 2 pick Jay Williams violated his contract by riding a motorcycle, and nearly lost his life in an accident that shattered his pelvis, severed a main nerve in his leg, and tore three ligaments in his left knee including his ACL. Although he underwent intense rehabilitation, Williams never played a game in the NBA again. When it became clear Williams would not be returning to the Bulls because of his injuries, he was waived. The Bulls could have voided Williams' contract because it prohibited riding a motorcycle. Instead, the Bulls executed a $3 million buyout of the contract in 2004 instead of having him walk away with nothing.Nance, Roscoe. Bulls, Jay Williams agree to contract buyout. February 2, 2004. Retrieved January 21, 2015. The draft was relatively weak outside of the top prospects. Several top players had promising careers end prematurely due to injury, including Yao Ming, Williams and Dajuan Wagner. Nevertheless, Yao was named a Hall of Famer—a selection predicated as much on his role in popularizing basketball in China as it was for his on-court play. , Udonis Haslem is the only remaining active player from the 2002 class, though he went undrafted. ==Draft selections== {|class=wikitable | PG || Point guard | SG || Shooting guard | SF || Small forward | PF || Power forward | C || Center |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\" ! width=\"1%\"| Round ! width=\"1%\"| Pick ! width=\"19%\"| Player ! width=\"1%\"| Position ! width=\"16%\"| Nationality ! width=\"35%\"| Team ! width=\"20%\"| School or club team |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 1 | bgcolor=\"#FFFF99\"| ^ | C | | Houston Rockets | Shanghai Sharks (China) |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 2 | | PG | | Chicago Bulls | Duke (Jr.) |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 3 | | SF/SG | | Golden State Warriors | Duke (Jr.) |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 4 | | PF/C | | Memphis Grizzlies | Kansas (Jr.) |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 5 | | PF/C | | Denver Nuggets | Benetton Treviso (Italy) |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 6 | | PG | | Cleveland Cavaliers | Memphis (Fr.) |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 7 | | C/PF | | New York Knicks (traded to Denver)The Knicks traded #7 pick along with Marcus Camby and Mark Jackson to the Nuggets for Antonio McDyess, #25 pick and a 2003 second-round pick. | Vasco da Gama (Brazil) |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 8 | | PF/C | | Los Angeles Clippers (from Atlanta) | Maryland (So.) |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 9 | bgcolor=\"#FBCEB1\"| *~ | PF/C | | Phoenix Suns | Cypress Creek HS (Orlando, Florida) |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 10 | bgcolor=\"#FFCC00\"| + | SF | | Miami Heat | Connecticut (So.) |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 11 | | PF/C | | Washington Wizards | Indiana (So.) |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 12 | | C/PF | | Los Angeles Clippers | Fresno State (Sr.) |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 13 | | PF | | Milwaukee Bucks | Tennessee (Jr.) |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 14 | | SG | | Indiana Pacers | Oregon (Sr.) |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 15 | | SF/PF | | Houston Rockets (from Toronto) | Benetton Treviso (Italy) |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 16 | | SG/SF | | Philadelphia 76ers (traded to Golden State) | Union Olimpija (Slovenia and Adriatic League) |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 17 | | PG | | Washington Wizards (from New Orleans) | Maryland (Sr.) |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 18 | | C | | Orlando Magic (traded to Utah) | Stanford (Jr.) |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 19 | | PF | | Utah Jazz (traded to Orlando) | Notre Dame (Sr.) |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 20 | | SG | | Toronto Raptors (from Seattle via New York, traded to Los Angeles Lakers) | Missouri (Jr.) |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 21 | | SF | | Portland Trail Blazers | Northeast Mississippi CC (So.) |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 22 | | SG | | Phoenix Suns (from Boston) | Stanford (Jr.) |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 23 | | SF | | Detroit Pistons | Kentucky (Sr.) |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 24 | | C/PF | | New Jersey Nets | Partizan Belgrade (Sinalco Superleague and Adriatic League) |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 25 | | PG | | Denver Nuggets (from Dallas, traded to New York) | Illinois (Jr.) |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 26 | | SF/SG | | San Antonio Spurs (traded to Philadelphia) | Miami (Sr.) |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 27 | | SF | | Los Angeles Lakers (traded to Toronto) | Fresno State (Jr.) |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 28 | | PG | | Sacramento Kings (traded to Atlanta) | Gonzaga (Sr.) |- |align=center| 1 |align=center| 29 |bgcolor=\"lightgray\"| Forfeited pick | | | Minnesota Timberwolves (forfeited their first-round pick due to salary cap violations) | |- |align=center| 2 |align=center| 30 |bgcolor=\"C0C0C0\"|# | PG | | Golden State Warriors | Cincinnati (Sr.) |- |align=center| 2 |align=center| 31 | | SG | | Chicago Bulls | Virginia (Jr.) |- |align=center| 2 |align=center| 32 | | PF | | Memphis Grizzlies | Illinois (Sr.) |- |align=center| 2 |align=center| 33 | | SF | | Denver Nuggets | Tennessee (Sr.) |- |align=center| 2 |align=center| 34 | | C | | Milwaukee Bucks (from Houston) | UCLA (Sr.) |- |align=center| 2 |align=center| 35 | bgcolor=\"#FBCEB1\"| * | PF | | Cleveland Cavaliers | Duke (Jr.) |- |align=center| 2 |align=center| 36 |bgcolor=\"C0C0C0\"| #
