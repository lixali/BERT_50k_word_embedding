The city is located in the south of Eaton Rapids Township, on the boundary with Hamlin Township, though it is politically independent of both townships. Its nickname is the Island City, since the downtown is located on an island, with a public park, in the Grand River. , Eaton Rapids, MI ==History== The Potawatomi people established a village in the area of what is now Eaton Rapids in about 1774. This was part of their wide territory in historic times.R. David Edmonds, The Potawatomis: Keepers of the Fire (Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1978), p. 99 The area constituting Eaton Rapids was first settled by Euro-Americans around the year 1835, who were drawn there because of the timber and water power in the area. It became a center of industry. The following year, a sawmill was constructed near Spring Brook in Spicerville; it provided the lumber settlers used to build Eaton Rapids. In 1837, the Old Red Mill was constructed by the mill company; it used waterpower from the stream to grind corn. The mill company later used wood from Spicerville to construct their own sawmill along the Grand River, as well as a wool carding mill. In 1852, mineral water was first discovered by E.B. Frost, earning Eaton Rapids worldwide fame and the nickname The Saratoga of the West, referring to Saratoga Springs, New York, which had tourism based on such waters. This water was in huge demand, and resulted in many people coming to take mineral water baths, considered to have health benefits, as well as cures from specific ailments. Fourteen wells were drilled in total to supply water for the baths. Only three are still operational. In 1921, John B. Davidson, Sr. came to Eaton Rapids from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He started the only textile mill in Michigan that spun its own yarn. The Davidson Mill supplied 95% of the wool yarn for major league baseball uniforms, as well as high-grade yarns for other applications. After 48 years in business, the mill burned in 1969. John B. Davidson became a politician, elected as mayor of Eaton Rapids, and later representing the area in both the State House and State Senate. In 1927, Irving Jacob Reuter and his wife Janet built Medovue, a 17-room, 10,000-square foot, Tudor Revival- style mansion, where they lived for nine years. President of the Oldsmobile automobile company, Reuter was also a financier and inventor. The Reuters donated substantial sums to charity. Their property was sold to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lansing, and became the private residence of its first Bishop, the Most Reverend Joseph H. Albers.Archdiocese of Lansing home page and history The diocese later sold the mansion. It was purchased by CJ and Mille Sumner, who adapted it and reopened it to operate as an Adult Foster Care Home. They furnished it with antiques and named it \"Ivy Manor\". The home was sold again in 1990 and was renovated for use as a bed and breakfast, known as the English Inn. In 1991 it was recognized and listed in the state List of Registered Historic Places in Michigan.English Inn history page The original building, complete with many of the original antique furnishings, has of gardens and pastoral countryside located on the river. It was purchased by Gary and Donna Nelson in 1996, who also developed a restaurant and pub on the property. It is open to the public for viewing. Their son Erik Nelson has taken over operations.{{cite web|url=https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/life/2018/09/18/english-inn- mansion-history-eaton-rapids-bed-and-breakfast/1173342002/ |author=Vickki Dozier |title=What you may not have known about English Inn's rich history |work=Lansing State Journal| date=18 September 2018|access-date=8 May 2019 ==Geography== Eaton Rapids is on the northward course of the Grand River as it flows from Jackson to Lansing.
