Elisha Lane located nearby, as did William Farley, and Rufus Allen. Other early settlers of Riverdale included Adam Fife, Alexander Patterson, Warren Gould Child Sr, Thomas Slater, Richard Woolsey, John Child, John C. Thompson, William Stimpson, Myron Barber Child, and George Ritter. Daniel Burch built a grist mill along the eastern bank of the Weber River in 1853. John Taylor, an LDS apostle, purchased and expanded the mill in 1858. Other industries began establishing, including match manufacturing (by Hugh Findlay, who later served as the settlement's first teacher), a blacksmith shop, and a canning factory. The town of Riverdale was finally incorporated on March 4, 1946. ==See also== * List of cities and towns in Utah ==References== ==External links== * Category:Cities in Utah Category:Cities in Weber County, Utah Category:Ogdenâ€“Clearfield metropolitan area Category:Populated places established in 1853",
