 "text": "Transport in Greece have undergone significant changes in the past two decades, vastly modernizing the country's infrastructure and transportation. Although ferry transport between islands remains the prominent method of transport between the nation's islands, improvements to the road infrastructure, rail, urban transport, and airports have all led to a vast improvement in transportation. These upgrades have played a key role in supporting Greece's economy, which in the past decade has come to rely heavily on the construction industry. ==Cable transport== thumb|alt=Lycabettus railway car|Lycabettus railway car thumb|alt=Cable car of Santorini|Cable car of Santorini *Lycabettus Funicular *Parnitha Funitel *Santorini cable car ==Rail transport== ===Railways=== *total: , ( are, or will be, electrified) *standard gauge: gauge *narrow gauge: gauge; gauge *dual gauge: combined and gauges (three rail system) (2004) The state owned company that owns and maintains Greece's railway network is called OSE, while TrainOSE is the company responsible for operating all passenger and freight trains. ===Metro=== right|thumb|Athens Metro Train (1st Generation) Cities with a rapid transit railway network: *Athens Metro (3 lines) (1 under construction) *Thessaloniki Metro (2 lines) (under construction) ===Commuter rail=== Cities with a commuter rail network (Proastiakos): *Athens (5 lines) *Thessaloniki (2 lines) *Patras (1 line) ===Tram=== *Athens Tram *List of town tramway systems in Greece ==Road transport== ===Highways=== *As of 2017, Greece has 2500 km of motorways.

Most of the regional units, though, have their own regional network of buses, and have their regional unit names labeled on KTEL vehicles that operate there. (e.g. KTEL Argolidas). There are 3 major bus terminals in Greece, the biggest is in Thessaloniki (Macedonia Inter city bus terminal) which serves all of Greece while Athens has 2 separate bus terminals serving different parts of Greece (Kifissos bus terminal and Liossion bus terminal). A new Athens bus terminal in Elaionas will replace the two separate terminals and serve all of Greece with completion by 2025. ==Water transport== ===Waterways=== thumb|View of the port of Patras The 80 km system consists of three coastal canals including the Corinth Canal (6 km) and three unconnected rivers.
