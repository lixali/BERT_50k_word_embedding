 "text": "Dr. Feelgood (stylized as D℞. FEELGOOD) is the fifth studio album by American heavy metal band Mötley Crüe, released on September 1, 1989. Dr. Feelgood topped the Billboard 200 chart, making it the band's only album to claim this position. It was the first album Mötley Crüe recorded after their quest for sobriety and rehabilitation in 1989. In addition to being Mötley Crüe's best selling album, it is highly regarded by music critics and fans as the band's best studio album. This was also the band's last album to be recorded with lead singer Vince Neil until the 1997 album Generation Swine. ==Recording== Producer Bob Rock found working with the Crüe difficult, describing them as \"four L.A. bad asses who used to drink a bottle of wine and want to kill each other.\" To minimize conflict and allow production to proceed smoothly, Rock had each member record their parts separately. The lyrics of \"Don't Go Away Mad (Just Go Away)\" feature a reference to \"Too Young to Fall in Love\" from the band's 1983 album Shout at the Devil. The intro track \"T.n.T. (Terror 'n Tinseltown)\" features a sample of a woman saying \"Dr Davis, telephone please\". This was the same sample used by the band Queensrÿche for their song \"Eyes of a Stranger\" which was off of their album Operation: Mindcrime released one year prior to Dr. Feelgood. The end of \"Slice of Your Pie\" is based on \"She's So Heavy\", from the Beatles' Abbey Road album. Steven Tyler of Aerosmith sings backing vocals on \"Sticky Sweet\". \"Nikki and Tommy and I hung out a lot,\" said Tyler, who was in Vancouver around the same time, recording Pump. \"Of course, we're all akin by our old drinking and drugging days.\"Rolling Stone 1989 retrospective, precise date unknown ==Release== Dr. Feelgood has sold more than 6 million copies in the U.S., and went Gold in the U.K. In various interviews, members of Mötley Crüe stated that it was their most solid album from a musical standpoint, due in no small part to their collective push for sobriety. ==Critical reception== Reviews for Dr. Feelgood have been highly positive. Critics remarked the renewed energy and entertaining values that permeate the album, bringing the listeners \"in a world of everlasting party\", where they \"savored the joys of trashy, unapologetically decadent fun\". Bob Rock's meticulous production was universally praised, in particular for affording \"the band the ability to write stronger melodic hooks without losing the hard rock sound they so coveted\" and for the power of the guitar riffs. Canadian journalist Martin Popoff wrote that Dr. Feelgood is an album \"made by a dumb band trying really hard\" while a BBC Music reviewer declared it \"a glitzy flashy experience... ultimately shallow and narcissistic\". Other critics stated that Mötley Crüe are not \"out to win humanitarian awards or impress us with lyrical muscle\", but to rock \"...hard\"! Dr. Feelgood, wrote Mick Wall in a review of 2009's reissue, \"was the first time Mötley Crüe actually became well-known for music. Until then, their unthinking mash-up of glam and metal had made them a hoot onstage but a disappointment on record… Though pushed close by last year's shock return with the weighty Saints of Los Angeles, [the album is] the best Mötley Crüe have ever released.\" \"Dr. Feelgood\" and \"Kickstart My Heart\" were nominated for Grammy awards for Best Hard Rock Performance in 1990 and 1991, but lost both years to Living Colour.Grammy Awards:Best Hard Rock Performance Mötley Crüe won the best Hard rock/Heavy metal album of the year at the American Music Awards in January 1991 for Dr. Feelgood. ==Legacy== Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich recruited Bob Rock to produce their self-titled 1991 album after being impressed with Rock's production work on Dr. Feelgood.Rosen, Craig.
