Roosevelt was originally called Jersey Homesteads, and was created during the Great Depression as part of President Roosevelt's New Deal, its main purpose being to resettle Jewish garment workers. The town was conceived as an integrated cooperative project, with farming, manufacturing, and retail all on a cooperative basis.Perdita Buchan, When Louis Kahn and Roosevelt Created a New Jersey Utopia dated December 4, 2014, at curbed.com, accessed January 14, 2016 The project fell under the discretion of the Resettlement Administration, but was conceived and largely planned out by Benjamin Brown.History Of Roosevelt, New Jersey, Rutgers University Library, accessed April 11, 2007. Farmland in Central Jersey was purchased by Jersey Homesteads, Inc., a corporation owned by the federal government but under control of a board of directors selected by Brown. Construction started around 1936. Soon after there were 200 homes and various public facilities in place. The economy of the town consisted of a garment factory and a farm. Objectives of the community were to help residents escape poverty, to show that cooperative management can work, and as an experiment in government intervention. Albert Einstein gave the town his political and moral support. Artist Ben Shahn lived in the town and painted a fresco mural viewable in the current Roosevelt Public School. The three panels show the history of the Jersey Homesteads, starting with the eastern European origins of its Jewish residents, their passage through Ellis Island and making plans for the community in Roosevelt.Roosevelt Mural, Roosevelt Arts Project website, accessed December 13, 2009.Jonas, Gerald; Meehan, Thomas; and Whiteside, Thomas. \"In Homage\", The New Yorker, September 29, 1962.

Political opposition came from those who thought too much money was being spent on the project, as well as those opposed to the New Deal in general. The Jersey Homesteads cooperative didn't last through World War II. It failed for a number of reasons.
