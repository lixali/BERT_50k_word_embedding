 "text": "Colby College is a private liberal arts college in Waterville, Maine. It was founded in 1813 as the Maine Literary and Theological Institution, then renamed Waterville College after the city where it resides. The donations of Christian philanthropist Gardner Colby saw the institution renamed again to Colby University before settling on its current title, reflecting its liberal arts college curriculum. Approximately 2,000 students from more than 60 countries are enrolled annually. The college offers 54 major fields of study and 30 minors. Located in central Maine, the 714-acre Neo-Georgian campus sits atop Mayflower Hill and overlooks downtown Waterville and the Kennebec River Valley. Along with fellow Maine institutions Bates College and Bowdoin College, Colby competes in the New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC) and the Colby-Bates-Bowdoin Consortium. In addition to Bates and Bowdoin, Colby is among the most selective liberal arts institutions in the country, and is considered a Little Ivy. ==History== === 19th century === On February 27, 1813, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, led by Baptists, adopted a petition to establish the Maine Literary and Theological Institution.Mayflower Hill, A History of Colby College, Earl Smith, University Press of New England, 2006 It was moved to Waterville, Maine, and used 179 acres of land donated by citizens. In 1818, trustees assigned the institution to Rev. Jeremiah Chaplin and classes began in a vacant Waterville home. After Maine separated from Massachusetts in 1820, the first Maine legislature affirmed the Massachusetts charter for the institution, but made significant changes. Students could no longer be denied admission based on religion, the institution was prohibited from applying a religious test when selecting board members, and the trustees now had the authority to grant degrees. The Maine Literary and Theological Institution was renamed Waterville College on February 5, 1821, and four years later, the theological department was discontinued. In 1828 the trustees decided to turn the somewhat informal preparatory department of the college into a separate school named Waterville Academy (most recently called the Coburn Classical Institute).\"Little Talks #749\" Colby College Special Collections. December 31, 1967. Accessed at In 1833, Rev. Rufus Babcock became Colby's second president, and students formed the nation's first college-based anti-slavery society. In 1845, the college's first Greek Society was formed, a chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon, which was followed by chapters of Zeta Psi in 1850 and Delta Upsilon in 1852.Colby College 1820-1925: An Account of Its Beginnings, Progress and Service, Edwin Carey Whittemore During the Civil War, many young men were called away from school to join the fight; from Waterville College, Richard C. Shannon, Henry C. Merriam, and Benjamin Butler. Twenty-seven Waterville College students perished in the war, and more than 100 men from the town. In the years following the war, as was the case at many American colleges, Waterville College was left with few students remaining to pay the bills and a depleted endowment. The college was on the verge of closing. thumb|alt=Colby University Logo|The emblem of Colby University, c. 1895 On August 9, 1865, prominent Baptist philanthropist Gardner Colby attended Waterville College's commencement dinner, and unbeknownst to anyone in attendance except college president James Tift Champlin, announced a matching $50,000 donation to the college; two years later the college was named after him. Trustees of the college voted to construct a library and chapel to honor the Colby men who died in the war, called the Memorial Hall; it was dedicated at the commencement of 1869. The college remained isolated from neighboring Bates College, and Bowdoin College due to its location in Waterville, coupled with socio-economic and political differences. At the 1871 commencement, a Martin Milmore sculpture based on the Lion of Lucerne was added as the centerpiece of the building. In the fall of 1871, Colby University was the first all-male college in New England to accept female students. The national Sigma Kappa sorority was founded at Colby in 1874 by the college's first five female students. However the college resegregated them in 1890. One of the buildings is named after the first woman to attend, Mary Caffrey Low, who was the valedictorian of the Class of 1875. In 1874, based on the success of its partnership with the Coburn Classical Institute, Colby created relationships with Hebron Academy and Houlton Academy (most recently known as Ricker College).The History Of Ricker, Ricker Alumni Association In 1893, the Higgins Classical Institute was also deeded to Colby - the last preparatory school that the university would acquire.History of the Baptists in Maine, by Henry Sweetser Burrage. p 437, Marks Printing House, 1904 Students published the first issue of The Colby Echo in 1877. On January 25, 1899, Colby president Nathaniel Butler Jr. '73, renamed the \"university\" Colby College. thumb|alt=Map of Old Colby Campus in Downtown Waterville|A map of the Old Colby Campus in Downtown Waterville, 1935 In 1920, Colby celebrated its centennial, marking not the date of the original charter (1813), but the date of its charter from the new State of Maine in 1820. === 20th century === Franklin W. Johnson was appointed president of the college in June 1929. That same year saw the public release of the Maine Higher Education Survey Report, which gave Colby's campus a less than desirable review. Criticisms included a cramped location on just 28 acres located between the Kennebec River and the Maine Central Railroad Company tracks through Waterville, an aging physical plant, proximity to the unpleasant odors of a pulp mill, and the soot of the railroad. Using the report as justification, President Johnson presented a proposal to the Trustees on June 14, 1929, to move the college to a more adequate location . The campaign to raise funds for the move was immediately complicated by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression, and competing offers for the college's contemplated location emerged.The Man of Mayflower Hill: A Biography of Franklin W. Johnson, by Ernest C. Marriner, Colby College Press, 1968 Most notably, William H. Gannett offered a site in Augusta - a financially attractive option for the college, but a troublesome prospect for the town of Waterville. Ultimately, a joint effort between Waterville citizens and the college raised more than $100,000 to purchase near the outskirts of the city on Mayflower Hill, and the deed was presented to the college on April 12, 1931.Mayflower Hill: A History of Colby College, Earl H. Smith, University Press of New England, 2006. pp 36-50. ====Mayflower Hill==== Colby employs 216 instructional faculty members, approximately 90% of whom hold a doctorate or other terminal degree. In 1937, according to master plans drawn up by Jens Fredrick Larson, construction broke ground on Lorimer Chapel, the first building on the new Mayflower Hill campus. In 1956, the Maine State Highway Commission diverted the proposed path of Interstate 95 to swing clear of the new campus to the west,http://digital.olivesoftware.com/Default/Skins/ColbyCollege/Client.asp?Skin=ColbyCollege&AppName;=2&AW;=1443640212710 and in 1961, Parade magazine called the 24-mile section of I-95 from Augusta to Waterville \"America's finest example of a 'driver's road' \" for scenery, speed, and safety. The college began competing athletically with Bowdoin and Bates in the 1940s, and officially joined the two colleges in the Colby-Bates- Bowdoin Consortium in 1965, after the University of Maine increased enrollment and moved to another athletic conference. The consortium became an athletic rivalry and academic exchange program. === 21st century === William D. Adams was the President of Colby from 2000 to 2014. Major accomplishments included conducting the largest capital campaign in the history of Maine, which raised $376 million; a new strategic plan for the college; accepting a major gift for the Colby College Museum of Art- the Lunder Collection of American Art - and the construction of a new wing for the museum to house it in 2013; expansion onto the \"Colby Green\" with the construction of the Diamond Building in 2007 and the Davis Science Building in 2014. In 2014, a documentary was created depicting a wide range of student experiences, including academic climate, social gatherings, athletics, and graduate outlooks, called Colby Life.Archived at Ghostarchive and the Wayback Machine: On July 1, 2014, David A. Greene took office as the new president of the college.Called to Action, Colby Magazine, Summer 2014 Ed. ==Academics== left|thumb|The Miller Library at dusk Students choose from courses in 54 major fields and have flexibility in designing independent study programs, electing special majors, and participating in internships and study-abroad programs. Colby emphasizes project-based learning. Colby's most popular majors are Government, Economics, and Biology. Volunteer programs and service learning take many students into the surrounding community. Colby employs 216 instructional faculty members, approximately 90% whom hold a doctorate or other terminal degree. The academic year follows a 4–1–4 with two four-course semesters plus a Winter Term session in January. The Winter Term, often called \"Jan-plan\", allows students to enroll in one intensive course, pursue independent research, or complete an off-campus internship. More than two-thirds of Colby's students spend time studying off-campus before they graduate. The college recognizes credits earned at over 200 off-campus programs in more than 60 countries. Additionally, studies at four programs locations are recognized for inclusion in students calculated grade-point averages: The International Center for French Studies at the University of Burgundy in Dijon, France; the St. Petersburg Classical Gymnasium in Saint Petersburg, Russia; The University of Salamanca in Salamanca, Spain; and the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Boothbay Harbor, Maine. Colby also participates in engineering dual-degree programs with the Columbia School of Engineering and Applied Science at Columbia University, and the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College. The programs vary in length and requirements. The Dartmouth College program, which is on a 2–1–1–1 schedule, is the more popular one. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; font-size:85%; margin:10px; text- align:center; font-size:85%; margin:auto;\" ! !2019 !2018 !2017 !2016 !2015 !2014 |- |Applicants |13,584 |12,313 |11,190 |9,833 |6,655 |5,407 |- |Admits |1,295 |1,602 |1,768 |1,838 |1,301 |1,408 |- |Admit rate |9.5% |13% |15.8% |18.7% |22.5% |28.1% |- |Enrolled |N/A |N/A |N/A |N/A |N/A |N/A |- |Median SAT |1500 |1490 |1420 |1370 |N/A |N/A |- |Median ACT |34 |33 |32 |31 |30 |30 |} For the class of 2024, Colby College admitted 9% of applicants, accepting 1,307 out of 13,922 applicants.http://www.colby.edu/news/2020/03/30/class- of-2024-admitted-to-colby/. Colby.edu. Retrieved 2020-07-06. This represents a 13.5 percentage point decrease from the acceptance rate for the Class of 2019, which was 22.5%, due in part to the college's decision to waive certain admissions requirements, such as the supplemental essay, and by increasing financial aid commitments. ===Rankings=== The 2020 annual ranking of U.S. News & World Report rates it tied for the 11th best liberal arts college overall in the U.S., 16th for \"Best Value\", tied at 18th for \"Most Innovative\" and tied at 48th for \"Best Undergraduate Teaching\" among liberal arts colleges.

The Goldfarb Center has assumed responsibility for organizing and awarding the Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award annually, established in 1952, the Morton A. Brody Distinguished Judicial Service Award, the William R. and Linda K. Cotter Debate Series, the Senator George J. Mitchell Distinguished International Lecture Series, and Colby's Visiting Fellows Program. The center also organizes Colby's civic engagement programs, the Colby Volunteer Center and Colby Cares about Kids. The college earned a top-25 listing on the Peace Corps' \"ranking of colleges that produce the most volunteers.\" Colby is a residential college and almost all students live on campus. The dormitories vary in design and age; some are from the original Mayflower Hill construction, with the newest addition being the Alfond Senior Apartments. Room arrangements range from singles to quads and apartment suites. Cotter Union is the center of student life and programming, and houses the Pulver Pavilion, Pugh Center for Multicultural Affairs, Page Commons auditorium, and the Student Post Office.

Admission is free to the museum, which serves both as a teaching resource for Colby College and as an active cultural institution for the residents of Maine and visitors to the state. It is notable for an entire wing dedicated to works by American painter Alex Katz, a particularly strong collection of American art, and its major outdoor sculptures by Richard Serra and Sol LeWitt. The museum is part of the Bixler Art and Music Center, a building named in honor of President J. Seelye Bixler (1942–1960) in recognition of his visionary support for the arts at Colby. The most recent addition to the museum was the Alfond-Lunder wing, opened in 2013 to display the recently donated Lunder Collection of American Art. The gallery space in the museum now exceeds 38,000 square feet, surpassing the Portland Museum of Art and making it the largest art museum in Maine. ===Sustainability=== In the fall of 2009, Colby launched Green Colby to highlight Colby's environmental policies (carbon footprint, conservation, student involvement etc.). The school has signed a number of official agreements to reduce its environmental impact, including the Maine Governor's Carbon Challenge and the American College and University President's Climate Commitment (ACUPCC). As of April 2013, Colby became the 4th institution of higher education to achieve campus carbon neutrality. All of the school's electricity comes from renewable sources—hydro and biomass—with 10 percent of campus electricity provided by an on-campus cogeneration turbine. The college has stated that all new buildings will comply with a minimum LEED silver standard, and renovated buildings will also include green features. The dining halls make an effort to purchase local and organic foods, and the elimination of trays has saved 79,000 gallons of water and 50 tons of food waste annually. Colby also has a composting program which processes more than 100 tons of food and yard waste annually. On the College Sustainability Report Card 2009 Colby earned a B; Colby's grade was brought down by its lack of endowment transparency and shareholder engagement. ==Student life== Colby's 1,800-plus students, evenly divided between men and women, come from every state and more than 60 countries. Colby students are listed as 67.2% white, 10.2% unknown race, 24% of its students being ALANA (Asian, Latino, African American, etc.) and 7% being international. Colby's was one of the five original schools to partner with the Shelby Davis Scholarship program for graduates from the United World Colleges, dramatically increasing the international student population.

The college was originally authorized to have a seal by its founding charter, granted by the Massachusetts General Court in 1813, in section 4. Presently, the seal figures prominently on college diplomas as well as other official communications and merchandise. ====History and Revisions==== thumb|right|200px|alt=Colby University Logo|The emblem of Colby University, c. 1895 The history of the seal tracks both the history of the school, which began under the name Maine Literary and Theological Institution, and sigillography generally. The earliest known seal came while the school was called Colby University. It featured a sun in splendour with eight straight rays above the school's Latin motto. Surrounding the center are the words \"Sigillum Universitatis Colbianae,\" meaning \"the seal of Colby College\", and two crossed olive branch with five leaves each.
