 "text": "The Process of Weeding Out is an instrumental EP released by Black Flag in 1985 on SST Records. One of the most potent realizations of Ginn's fascination with the avant-garde, The Process of Weeding Out is described by critic Chris True of Allmusic as \"an interesting document of Greg Ginn's development from high-speed guitar 'sculptor' to one of the few punk artists to embrace 12-tone experimental music.\" Robert Palmer of The New York Times described the album as \"what jazz-rock could have become if the best of the musicians who first crossbred jazz improvising with rock's sonic fire power had followed their most creative impulses.\" The back cover has a quote from guitarist Greg Ginn, reading, in part: \"...even though this record may communicate certain feelings, emotions, and ideas to some, I have faith that cop-types with their strictly linear minds and stick-to-the-rules mentality don't have the ability to decipher the intuitive contents of this record.\" ==Track listing== All songs by Greg Ginn, except where noted. Side one #\"Your Last Affront\" – 9:39 #\"Screw the Law\" – 2:24 Side two #\"The Process of Weeding Out\" – 9:58 #\"Southern Rise\" (Ginn/Kira Roessler/Bill Stevenson) – 5:00 ==Personnel== *Greg Ginn – guitar *Kira Roessler – bass guitar *Bill Stevenson – drums *Raymond Pettibon – cover art ==References== Category:Black Flag (band) EPs Category:1985 EPs Category:SST Records EPs Category:Albums produced by Bill Stevenson (musician)",
