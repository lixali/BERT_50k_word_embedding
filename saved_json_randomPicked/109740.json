Most notable were \"Hell-Town\" (muggy, inhospitable land covered with briars, mosquitoes, thorns, snakes) \"Jernigan's Landing\", \"Scratch Ankle\" (due to the briars that grew along the riverbank), and \"Hard Scrabble.\" According to Florida historian Allen Morris, \"Just which Milton was honored by the final name is a dispute. Some say it is a contraction of an earlier Milltown; others that it was Milton Amos, pioneer and ancestor of the present Amos family; still others that it was John Milton—not the English poet, but the Civil War governor of Florida.\" ==History== Milton was settled in the early 1800s as a small village centered on the lumber industry. The settlement originally was known as Scratch Ankle because of the briars and bramble that grew in the area.
