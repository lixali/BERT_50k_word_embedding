For the purposes of the 1995 census, the government of Laos recognized 149 ethnic groups within 47 main ethnicities. whereas the Lao Front for National Construction (LFNC) recently revised the list to include 49 ethnicities consisting of over 160 ethnic groups. The term ethnic minorities is used by some to classify the non-Lao ethnic groups, while the term indigenous peoples is not used by Lao authorities. These 160 ethnic groups speak a total of 82 distinct living languages. ==Mon-Khmer== *Aheu (population of approximately 1,770 in Bolikhamsai Province) *Alak (population of approximately 4,000 in southern Laos) *Arem (population of approximately 500 in Laos) *Bo (population of 2,950 in Laos) *Bru (population of approximately 69,000 in Laos) *Chut (population of 450 in Khammouane Province) *Halang Doan (population of 2,350 in Attapeu Province and on the Kasseng Plateau) *Hung or Tum (population of 2,000 in Bolikhamsai and Khammouane Provinces) *Ir (population of 4,420 in Salavan Province) *Jeh (population of 8,013 in southern Laos) *Katang (population of 107,350 in Laos) *Katu (population of 14,700 in Laos) *Khlor (population of 6,000 in Laos) *Khmer (population of 10,400 in Laos) *Khua (population of 2,000 in Laos) *Kri *Kuy (population of 51,180 in Laos) *Lavae (also referred to as Brao)Ta Ong Trail *Lave (population of 12,750 in Laos) *Laven (population of 40,519 in Laos) *LaviLaos Cultural Profile (Ministry of Information and Culture/Visiting Arts) *Maleng (population of 800 in Laos) *Mon *Ngae (population of 12,189 in Laos) *Nguon *Nyaheun *Ong *Oi (population of 23,500 in Laos) *Pakoh *Phong *Sadang *Salang (ethnic group) *Sapuan (ethnic group) *Makong *Sou *Souei *Taliang *Ta-oi *Vietnamese (population of 76,000 in Laos) *Yae ==Palaungic== *Bit (population of 1,530 in Laos, disputed as to whether Palaungic or Khmuic) *Con (population of 1,000 in Luang Namtha Province) *Samtao (population of 2,359 in Laos) *Lamet (population of 16,740 in Laos) ==Khmuic== *Khmu (population of 389,694 in Laos) *Khuen (population of approximately 8,000 in Laos) *Mal (population of 23,200 in Laos) *Mlabri (population of 24 in Laos, also known as the Yumbri) *O'du *Phai (population of 15,000 in Laos) *Xinh Mul (population of 3,164 in Laos, including Phong-Kniang and Puoc, also known as the Sing Mun)Ta La, Laos ==Tibeto-Burman== *Lolo ethnicity **Kaw (population of approximately 58,000 in Laos) **Hani (population of 1,122 in Phongsaly Province) **Kaduo (population of 5,000 on Laos-China border) **Lahu (population of 8,702 in Laos, also referred to as Museu) **Lahu Shi (population of 3,240 in Laos) **Phana **Phunoi **Si La *Kado (population of 225 in Phongsaly Province) ==Hmong-Mien== *Hmong Daw (population of 200,000 in Laos) *Hmong Njua (population of 245,600 in Laos) *Iu Mien (population of 20,250, also called Yao) *Kim Mun (population of 4,500 in Laos) ==Tai and Rau== *Tai Daeng *Tai Dam *Tai Gapong *Tai He (or Tai E) *Tai Khang (population of 47,636 in Laos) *Tay Khang *Tai Kao *Kongsat *Kuan (population of 2,500 in Laos) *Tai Laan *Tai Maen *Lao (population of 3,000,000 in Laos) *Lao Lom *Tai Long *Tai Lue (population of 300,000 in Laos) *Northeastern Thai (including the Tai Kaleun and Isan people) *Tai Nuea *Kassak (located to the south and southeast of Luang Prabang, in an area bounded by the Nam Khan River, Phu Hin Salik, Nam Sanane River, Nam Ming River, and Nam Khan River up to Xieng Ngeun District).
