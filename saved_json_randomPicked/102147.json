 "text": "Mount Frankland National Park is a national park in the South West region of Western Australia, south of Perth. The park is part of the larger Walpole Wilderness Area that was established in 2004, an international biodiversity hotspot. ==Geography== It covers the low granite hills to the north of the town of Walpole and is covered largely by forests of karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor) and red tingle (Eucalyptus jacksonii), two of the world's largest trees. The three tingle species are unique to the area between the park and the coast and the only eucalypts to be buttressed, a feature which reflects the moist conditions prevailing within the park. On exposed areas where continuous rain washes away soil, a low heathland is the dominant vegetation. Annual rainfall at Walpole is around . On the 422-metre high peak of Mount Frankland, though no rain gauge has ever been installed, annual rainfall is probably around . Most rain falls between May and August, but unlike drier parts of southwestern Australia, showers are not infrequent even during the summer. ==See also== * Protected areas of Western Australia ==References== Category:National parks of Western Australia Category:Protected areas established in 1988",
