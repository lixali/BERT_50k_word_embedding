In 1875, S. S. McCall established the Illinois Canning Company to can locally grown vegetables; and this was so successful that in 1878 the Hoopeston Canning Company was established, which later became part of Stokely-Van Camp, Inc. In addition, Silgan Can (formerly American Can) had a factory which manufactured the tin cans themselves, and an FMC plant manufactured agricultural machinery. There was also an engine company there until at least 1915, the Hoopeston Gas Engine Company, which catered to agriculture and home use. In honor of its agricultural roots, including the growing of sweet corn, Hoopeston holds a Sweet Corn Festival each September, starting the Thursday before Labor Day and ending on Labor Day.

Its contestants are runners-up from the Miss America state pageants who have been invited to Hoopeston for the competition. The event, which has no official ties to the Miss America Organization, is sponsored by the Hoopeston Jaycees and is held on Labor Day weekend in conjunction with the town's annual Sweetcorn Festival. Most contestants were the first runners-up in their state pageants, but second and other runners-up are invited if the first runner-up chooses not to attend. The winner of the title receives a $1,200 scholarship and a pendant shaped like an ear of corn. Winning this title does not guarantee that a contestant will win a Miss America state title, but since 1980, five Miss National Sweetheart winners have gone on to win both their state and the Miss America title. Since 1970 there have been nine Miss America titleholders who have competed in the National Sweetheart pageant. In 2016, the Miss America organization officially disassociated itself with the Miss National Sweetheart Organization. Pursuant to their decision, Miss America state pageant contestants are prohibited from competing for Miss National Sweetheart. ==Notable people== * Mary Hartwell Catherwood, American author, longtime resident * Frankie Gustine, infielder for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Browns * Thad Matta, Ohio State University head men's basketball coach * Tom Merritt, Illinois state senator and businessman ==References== ==External links== * City of Hoopeston * hoopeston.org, Hoopeston related web sites and businesses * Hoopeston school district Category:Cities in Illinois Category:Cities in Vermilion County, Illinois Category:Populated places established in 1871 Category:1871 establishments in Illinois",
