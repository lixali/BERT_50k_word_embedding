Along with Snoop Dogg and Nate Dogg, he formed the hip-hop trio 213, named for Long Beach's area code. A pioneer of G-funk, he attained mainstream success with the 1994 single \"Regulate\", a duet with Nate Dogg. The younger stepbrother of producer Dr. Dre, he introduced him to Snoop Dogg, who was later signed by him. His debut album, Regulate... G Funk Era, was certified 3x multi-platinum. \"Regulate\" spent 18 weeks in the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, with three weeks at No. 2, while \"This D.J.\", reached No. 9. Both songs earned Grammy nominations. Three songs from his second album, Take a Look Over Your Shoulder, reached the Top 40,Warren G's third Top 40 hit, at #32 in October 1996, is his 1997 album's track \"What's Love Got to Do With It\", featuring singer Adina Howard, but had been released first on the 1996 soundtrack of the American release of Jackie Chan's 1992 Chinese film Supercop. as did his 1998 duet with Nate Dogg, \"Nobody Does It Better\". Both Take a Look Over Your Shoulder and his next album, I Want It All, were certified gold, the last of his albums to attain certification. His 2001 comeback attempt, The Return of the Regulator, failed to reach his earlier heights despite a star-studded collaborator list, and he was criticized for undermining from his strengths by trying to exceed them. His next two albums, 2005's In the Mid-Nite Hour and then 2009's The G Files, released independently, were self-produced and escaped popular notice. In the 2010s, he experienced a resurgence in popularity amid the digital age. In 2015, he released Regulate... G Funk Era, Pt. II, an EP featuring archived recordings of Nate Dogg, who died in 2011. In 2017, \"Regulate\", platinum since 1994, went 2x multi-platinum, propelled by digital downloads. ==Early life== Warren Griffin III was born on November 10, 1970, in Long Beach, a city in California's Los Angeles County. He had three sisters and was the only son of Warren Griffin Jr., an airplane mechanic, and Ola, a dietician.Brenna Sanchez, \"Contemporary Musicians: Warren G\", Encyclopedia.com, Cengage, updated April 12, 2020. They divorced when Warren was 4 and he lived with his mother and three sisters in East Long Beach until he was just about to start middle school. In 1982, Warren went to live with his father in North Long Beach. His new wife, Verna, had three children from a prior marriage, one of whom was Andre Young, the soon-to-become Dr. Dre who in 1984 joined a leading DJ crew, the World Class Wreckin' Cru, which by 1985 doubled as an electro rap group, which in 1987 put out the Los Angeles area's first rap recording under a major label.David Diallo, ch 10 \"From electro-rap to G-funk: A social history of rap music in Los Angeles and Compton, California\", in Mickey Hess, ed., Hip Hop in America: A Regional Guide, Volume 1: East Coast and West Coast (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2010).David Diallo, \"Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg\", in Mickey Hess, ed., Icons of Hip Hop: An Encyclopedia of the Movement, Music, and Culture (Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood Press, 2007), pp 319–322. By then, a Jordan High School student, Warren was playing football and running with friends. At age 17, Warren was jailed for gun possession. While incarcerated, he took the nickname Warren G. Released soon after, he began focusing on music after Dr. Dre taught him how to use a drum machine. Meanwhile, still in 1988, Dr. Dre was the lead record producer for Ruthless Records and for, as a member of, N.W.A—a new rap group on the new label—whose landmark album, Straight Outta Compton, was driving the Los Angeles area's rap scene to swiftly drop electro for gangsta, while Warren G, fresh out of high school, was jailed for selling drugs. Once out, he worked at the Long Beach shipyards. By 1990, Warren G had formed the trio 213,Mosi Reeves, \"Warren G and Nate Dogg's 'Regulate': The oral history of a hip-hop classic\", Rolling Stone website, Penske Media LLC, December 19, 2014. with two longtime running mates, Nathaniel \"Nate Dogg\" Hale and Calvin \"Snoop Dogg\" Broadus. 213 was a contributor to the G-funk sound to soon emerge in rap.Jeff Weiss explains, \"As much as 'The Chronic' is a psychedelic and sinister warp of the Parliament and Funkadelic records that constantly rotated on Dre's childhood turntable, it is the sound of Long Beach, too: the ecumenical hymns of the Baptist church turned into filthy harmonic gospel by Snoop, Nate Dogg, Warren G and Daz\" [J Weiss, \"25 years later, Dr. Dre's 'The Chronic' remains rap's world-building masterpiece\", Washington Post & Chicago Tribune, December 15, 2017]. For some on this in Warren's own words, see Ebro Darden & Laura Stylez, interviewers, \"Warren G talks growing up as Dr. Dre's brother, Snoop's early rap battles and his new album\", Hot 97 @ YouTube, August 10, 2015, 22:30 mark. The trio dissolved after Warren G connected them to Dr. Dre. At that point, two solo careers were launched: Dr. Dre's and Snoop Dogg's, upon G-funk.Ben Westhoff, \"The making of The Chronic\", LA Weekly, November 19, 2012.\"Dr. Dre speaks at Snoop Dogg's Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony 11.19.18\", The Hollywood Fix @ YouTube, November 19, 2018. Nate, too, signed to Dr. Dre's Death Row Records. Warren G initially helped there, but, not desiring a career in his mentor and stepbrother's shadow, signed to Def Jam Recordings, in New York City. ==Career== === Start with 213 (circa 1990) === By 1990, in his hometown Long Beach, as record producer and rapper, Warren formed a music trio with two of his longtime running mates, Nathaniel \"Nate Dogg\" Hale, a rapperlike singer, and Calvin \"Snoop Rock\" Broadus,In his 1994 single \"Do You See,\" Warren G reminisces on his background, while incidentally noting, twice, that 213 had originally been Warren G, Nate Dogg, and Snoop Rock, amid visuals that briefly show the V.I.P record shop [Warren G, \"Do You See\", Warren G @ YouTube, October 6, 2009]. a singerlike rapper. The Long Beach trio, fond of Oakland rap group 415, named for the Bay area's area code, took the name 213, the Los Angeles area's. Practicing and recording in the modest studio in Long Beach record store V.I.P., they cut a demo tape. Dr. Dre, already a celebrity, rebuffed his younger stepbrother Warren's requests for him to listen.P.R., \"Warren G\", in Nathan Brackett with Christian Hoard, eds., The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2004), p 859. For Warren's own telling, see Ebro Darden & Laura Stylez, interviewers, \"Warren G talks growing up as Dr. Dre's brother, Snoop's early rap battles and his new album\", Hot 97 @ YouTube, August 10, 2015. On the V.I.P. record store, see Andrea Domanick, \"World famous V.I.P. Records to close\", LA Weekly, January 5, 2012. Before long, homemade copies of 213's songs spread in Los Angeles county, particularly the cities Compton and Pomona, and Los Angeles city's sections Watts and South Central, but no label picked them up. One day, Warren phoned Dre to catch up, and found him at a bachelor party—thrown for Dre's friend Andre \"LA Dre\" Bolton, another record producer—whereupon Warren found himself invited to join it. There, once the songs began to repeat, Warren offered LA Dre the 213 tape. Liking it, he summoned Dr. Dre, who, hearing the Snoop rap \"Super Duper Snooper\", immediately welcomed the trio. Days later, 213 moved into Dre's lavish troubadour-style house in Calabasas, home to both his wife and his recording studio.In Calabasas, on the hills west of the San Fernando Valley, Dre had bought, in perhaps 1989, \"a lavish troubadour-style home\", and put a recording studio in an upstairs bedroom [Gerrick D. Kennedy, Parental Discretion Is Advised: The Rise of N.W.A and the Dawn of Gangsta Rap (New York: Atria Books, 2017), pp 123 & 132. In April 1992, Dr. Dre's debut solo single \"Deep Cover\" introduced America to Snoop Doggy Dogg, the track's guest but instantly star rapper.David Diallo, \"Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg\", in Mickey Hess, ed., Icons of Hip Hop: An Encyclopedia of the Movement, Music, and Culture, Volume 1 (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2007), pp 326–327. Warren helped Dre find sounds for Dre's debut solo album The Chronic, further debuting Snoop, whereby superstardom chased Snoop into 1993 and, via Snoop's own debut solo album, Doggystyle, captured him by 1994.Stereo Williams, \"When Snoop became the most wanted man in America\", Daily Beast, November 18, 2018. By then, also solo, Nate, too, had joined Dre's label, Death Row Records.By the July 1998 release of Nate Dogg's repeatedly delayed solo album, the curtain was already closing on G-funk's popular run [Thomas Erlewine, \"Nate Dogg: G Funk Classics, Vols. 1 & 2\", AllMusic.com, Netaktion LLC, visited April 24, 2020]. Warren, returning to Long Beach, aimed to find his own way.Gill, Karam, director, \"G Funk | Official Documentary\", SnoopDoggTV @ YouTube Premium, 11 Jull 2018, which webpage offers a written synopsis.

Singleton asked Warren to produce a song for the soundtrack of his forthcoming film Poetic Justice. Warren thus produced Mista Grimm's song \"Indo Smoke\", featuring Warren G and Nate Dogg. The single's success led to Warren's invitation to Russell Simmons's label Def Jam Recordings, where Warren G signed a record deal. Also that year, Warren and Nate, along with Kurupt—whom the 213 trio had brought to Dre to help on his album The Chronic—feature on \"Ain't No Fun\", a huge underground hit, too risque to be a single, on Snoop's Doggystyle album, released in November.About tracks on Dr. Dre's album 2001, Soren Baker writes, \"If fact, even songs that did not receive accompanying videos became huge underground hits, as had been the case with The Chronic's 'Bitches Ain't Shit' and Doggystyle's 'Ain't No Fun (If the Homies Can't Have None)\" [S Baker, The History of Gangster Rap (New York: Abrams Image, 2018)]. On the Above The Rim soundtrack, from Death Row Records in April 1994, the single \"Regulate\" was a duet cowritten and performed by Warren G and Nate Dogg.

Yet at May 2020, the only song this adds to the Hot 100's Top 40 is \"Do You See\", #42 in January 1995. Incidentally, the Billboard.com webpage apparently dates by latest peak position, with \"Regulate\", for instance, at #2 in July 1994. Apparently dating instead by earliest peak position, with \"Regulate\" at #2 in May 1994, is Joel Whitburn, \"Warren G\", The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits (New York: Billboard Books, 2010), p 696: in chronological order, \"Regulate,\" with Nate Dogg (#2 in May 1994 and three weeks); \"This D.J.\" (#9 in July 1994); \"What's Love Got to Do with It,\" featuring Adina Howard (#32 in September 1996); \"I Shot the Sheriff\" (#20 in March 1997); \"Smokin' Me Out,\" featuring Ronald Isley (#35 in June 1997); Nate Dogg's single \"Nobody Does It Better,\" featuring Warren G (#18 in July 1998); \"I Want It All,\" featuring Mack 10 (#23 in October 1999). it was the summer's top rap hit.

And his modest rap styling maximized, by heeding, his modest lyricism.P.R., \"Warren G\", in Nathan Brackett with Christian Hoard, eds., The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2004), p 859. \"Regulate\" doubled as the lead single Warren G's debut album, Regulate...

In August, it was certified 2x multi-platinum, two million copies sold. Its second single, \"This D.J.\", went gold, half a million copies, in September, while peaking in July at No. 9. At the 1995 Grammy Awards, in March, both singles were nominated.\"Regulate\" was nominated in Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group, and \"This D.J.\" in Best Rap Solo Performance.

And 1996 saw Warren G on the \"Groupie\" track of Snoop's second album, Tha Doggfather. === Followup albums (1997–2001) === Warren G's second album, Take a Look Over Your Shoulder, released in March 1997, was certified gold, half a million copies sold, in May. Sharing with the Supercop soundtrack the single \"What's Love Got To Do with It\", featuring singer Adina Howard, a spin on the 1984 single by Tina Turner, reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart,\"Warren G\", OfficialCharts.com, The Official UK Charts Company, visited May 12, 2020. and peaked in the US at No. 32 on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Smokin' Me Out\", featuring Ron Isley of the classic soul group, reaching No. 35, was big on the Los Angeles area's radio play. \"I Shot the Sheriff\", a lyrical spin on the 1973 single by Bob Marley & the Wailers, yet an instrumental borrow from rap group EPMD's 1988 single \"Strictly Business\", which itself samples that Wailers classic, reached No. 20. Yet a letdown overall, the album missed his debut's superstar potential.John Bush, \"Warren G: I Want It All\", AllMusic.com, Netaktion LLC, visited May 8, 2020. In July 1998, Warren G's sixth appearance in the Billboard Hot 100's upper tier Top 40 became Nate Dogg's single \"Nobody Does it Better\"—on Nate's repeatedly delayed debut album—featuring Warren G, in another duet, which peaked at No. 18 on the Billboard Hot 100. Here, incidentally, Warren raps a bar indicating his transition to family life.In the \"Nobody Does It Better\" single, in his third and final verse, Warren G raps, in two bars, \"Hot rap singles, on the charts now / Got a baby, so I'm breaking hearts now\" \"Nobody Does It Better lyrics—Nate Dogg\", MetroLyrics.com, CBS Interactive Inc., 2020]. Warren's third album, I Want It All, released in October 1999, has Warren mainly producing—where, perhaps, his greater comparative strength among musical peers abides—while vocals go largely to guest artists, including Nate Dogg, Snoop Dogg, RBX, Kurupt, Eve, Slick Rick, and Jermaine Dupri. Certified gold in November 1999, it bears the single \"I Want It All\", featuring Mack 10, which, becoming Warren's most recent Top 40 appearance, peaked on the Hot 100 at No. 23. Over 20 years later, his 1997 and 1999 albums remain at gold certification, which none of his subsequent albums have achieved. Released in December 2001, Warren's fourth album, The Return of the Regulator, with a litany of collaborators, including the P-Funk father and G-funk godfather George Clinton and, elsewhere, Dr. Dre producing a track, is allegedly overdone, a comeback undone by Warren's reaching beyond his strengths and being outdone by his guests.Jason Birchmeier, \"Warren G: The Return of the Regulator\", AllMusic.com, Netaktion LLC, He \"wastes a hot, Dre-produced beat\", in the single \"Lookin' at You\", alleges a Vibe writer, who finds G-funk on its deathbed and Warren G \"administering the fatal shot\".Shawn Edwards, \"Warren G: The Return of the Regulator\", Vibe, 2002 Jan;10(1):124.

Heavily featuring his native, 213 groupmates Nate and Snoop, it is devotedly Warren's own project, homemade on a low budget. Music critics assess it to better carry Warren G's own virtues as G-funk's everyman. Yet by that very virtue, as expected, it saw scarce exposure beyond Warren G's fans. His sixth album, in September 2009, The G Files, \"still the same basic G-funk sound\", adds to \"that classic soul vibe\", Warren explains, \"a taste of that modern electro sound\".Jeff Weiss, \"The G-funk continuum: Warren G talks 'The G-Files,' 'The X-Files' and West Coast hip hop\", Pop & Hiss, the L.A.

And in August 2014, on the Mnet channel's reality series American Hustle Life, he directed an alternate music video for \"Boy In Luv\", by South Korean boy band BTS. Nostalgic fans would ask Warren for more of classic G-funk, and even ask for more from Nate Dogg, who had died in 2011.Ebro Darden & Laura Stylez, interviewers, \"Warren G talks growing up as Dr. Dre's brother, Snoop's early rap battles and his new album\", Hot 97 @ YouTube, August 10, 2015Erika Ramirez, \"Warren G to release 'Regulate…G Funk Era Part II' EP this summer\", Billboard.com, July 8, 2015.

Released on August 6, it features E-40, Too Short, Jeezy, Bun B, and, in all four songs, Nate Dogg. With his unique knack for intuiting Warren's production cues, Nate leaves behind some of his 213 partner's favorite recordings. ==Personal life== Apart from his music career, Warren has four children with his wife, Tenille Griffin.

As a kid, all my pops used to do was cook, create recipes and play good music. He would tell my sisters, brothers and I all about the stories of his many journeys. Even though it was fun to hear him talk about those things, it was also very interesting to me. One of the things that stood out the most to me was when he would talk BBQ. The flavor of the smoke on the meat and just the good feeling of having family around caught me up and rang a bell in my head. As I got older, all I wanted to do was be like my dad on the smoker and grill because it reminded me of his morals and good family fun; and so, a pit master was born into a lifestyle of fun, family and celebration.
