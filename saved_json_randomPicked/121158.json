In 1991 the city contributed $35,000 to the Regional Arts Retreat and Cultural Center to convert a downtown mercantile building into a multi-use arts and cultural facility. As a per-capita investment, this expenditure would be the equivalent of Minneapolis giving $13.7 million to an arts facility. The center, remodeled through a community- wide volunteer effort, opened its doors in June, 1992, as a non-profit Arts organization founded by John Davis. Further renovations include a new hardwood maple floor in the main gallery and an outdoor deck completed in 2005. While other communities withered in the face of declining populations and deteriorating main streets, New York Mills has remained stable economically, while the Cultural Center continues to draw people, activity, revenue and national attention to the community. ====Programs==== * Artist-In-Residence Program * Education/Outreach programs * Gallery Exhibits * “Great American Think-Off” Annual Philosophical Debate * Literary and Theater Events * Music Concert Series * Sculpture Park ====Past exhibiting artists==== * Robin Barcus Slonina * Charles Beck * Betsy Bowen * Duane & Bambi Goodwin * Eric Johnson * Kent Kapplinger * Maxwell MacKenzie * David Salmela * Charvis Harrell ==Notable people== *Peter Hayes (born 1976), indie rock guitarist and singer *Janet Karvonen, pioneer for girls' basketball ==See also== * Finn Creek Museum ==References== ==External links== *ExploreNewYorkMills.com -- New York Mills, MN -- Visitor Information site * City of New York Mills website Category:Cities in Minnesota Category:Cities in Otter Tail County, Minnesota Category:Populated places established in 1883 Category:1883 establishments in Minnesota Category:Finnish-American culture in Minnesota",
