Baldwyn has the unusual distinction of having been incorporated in four counties. It was incorporated by an act of the Legislature in Tishomingo and Itawamba counties on April 1, 1861. Lee county was formed from parts of Itawamba and Pontotoc on October 26, 1866, while Tishomingo was divided into Alcorn, Prentiss, and Tishomingo on April 15, 1870. Baldwyn is an outgrowth of the village of Carrollville: when the Mobile and Ohio Railroad was being built during the years of 1848 to 1861, it missed Carrollville by one and one-half miles and the citizens moved to the new town of Baldwyn, which was named for the civil engineer who surveyed the road through the town.
