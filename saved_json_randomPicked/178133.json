On 1 January 1909, the municipality was split into three: Austad in the south (population: 1,263), Kvås in the north (population: 736) and Lyngdal in the central area (population: 2,698). During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the municipalities of Austad (population: 608), Kvås (population: 493), Lyngdal (population: 2,916) as well as the Gitlevåg area (population: 103) in Spangereid municipality, west of Lenesfjorden, were all merged to form one large municipality of Lyngdal. On 1 January 1971, the Ytre Skarstein and Indre Skarstein areas of Lyngdal (population: 21) was transferred to the neighboring municipality of Farsund. On 1 January 2001, the municipality of Lyngdal declared that the municipal centre of Alleen would be a town called Lyngdal. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring municipalities of Audnedal and Lyngdal merged into a new, larger municipality called Lyngdal. ===Name=== The municipality is named after the Lyngdalen valley in which the municipality is located. The Old Norse form of the name was Lygnudalr. The first element is the genitive case of the river name Lygna and the last element is dalr which means \"valley\" or \"dale\". The river name is derived from logn which means \"quietness\" and so the meaning is \"the quiet one\". Prior to 1908, the parish (but not the municipality) of Lyngdal was called Aa, named after the vicarage. The name of the vicarage was first mentioned in 1312 as \"a Am\", the dative plural of á which means '(small) river'. The farm lies between two rivers. ===Coat of arms=== The current coat of arms was approved for use starting on 1 January 2020. The arms are green with a white tree on top of three wavy lines. The tree symbolizes growth. It has nine leaves symbolizing the nine main population centres within Lyngdal. The wavy lines represent waves and meadows. There are three lines to represent the three large rivers in the municipality as well. The old coat of arms was granted on 27 March 1987 and in use until 1 January 2020. The arms are green with a white cow facing left in the center. The local breed of cows () is very well known in Norway and at the yearly cattle fair traders from all over Southern and Western Norway visit the municipality.

Based around the port of Agnefest, Lyngdal prospered on maritime trade, and in 1771 an application was made for status as a small coastal town. Its coastal location also facilitated emigration; in the 17th and 18th century largely to the Dutch Republic, and in the 19th century to the United States. Even before the merger of the municipalities in 1964, the parishes of Austad and Kvås, together with Å (or Aa - Lyngdal proper), made up the greater Lyngdal parish. A census from 1801 showed 3529 inhabitants in the area that today makes up Lyngdal: 1850 in Å, 929 in Austad, 585 in Kvås and 165 in the eastern part of Spangereid. The number today is approximately 8000 inhabitants. Religious life and missionary work have always had a strong position in Lyngdal, and worthy of special note is the minister Gabriel Kielland (1796–1854), who served in the parish from 1837 to 1854, and his wife Gustava (1800–1889). Known today as a missionary pioneer and a popular songwriter, Gustava also wrote one of the first autobiographies by a woman in Norway: her \"Reminiscence from my Life\" from 1880. ==Geography== thumb|left|upright 1.1|Agnefest in the south of Lyngdal has since 1771 an approved natural harbor on the Rosfjord Lyngdal is a coastal municipality that and borders Lindesnes municipality to the east, Evje og Horness and Åseral to the north, Hægebostad and Kvinesdal and Farsund to the west.
