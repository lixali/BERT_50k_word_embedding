He learned to play the guitar at age 13. ==Career== ===Nickelback=== In the early 1990s, Kroeger was part of a grunge cover band, Village Idiot, with his cousin Brandon Kroeger and future Nickelback members bassist Mike Kroeger (his brother) and singer Ryan Peake. In 1995, Kroeger, Peake, Mike Kroeger, and then drummer Brandon Kroeger, formed the band Nickelback.

Also in 2002, Kroeger wrote and sang on \"Why Don't You & I\" for Santana's Shaman. However, when Arista decided to release the song as a single in Summer 2003, Kroeger's label, Roadrunner, refused permission, citing concerns that Kroeger appearing on a \"high-profile single\" would compromise the excitement over Nickelback's fall 2003 release The Long Road. Kroeger recommended The Calling's Alex Band, another Arista artist, as a replacement for re-recording the single.\"Nickelback's Record Company Explains Chad Kroeger ban on Santana Single \" – July 2, 2003 @ RoadrunnerRecords.com\"Carlos Santana Says Label Politics Forced Chad Kroeger/Alex Band Change On New Single\" @ Music.Yahoo!
