In the 1880s, Oscar Townsend and the Cleveland, Lorain, & Wheeling Railroad developed a prosperous vacation resort, eventually called Chippewa Lake Park, on the banks of Chippewa Lake. The Great Depression and extinction of interurban rail service crippled the park, but in 1937, Parker Beach purchased the resort, and it enjoyed a swinging Golden Age through 1969, as he kept the park's ballroom filled with dancers and famous bands. In 1978, after more than 100 years of operation, Chippewa Lake Park was shut down and left to decay. In 2008, scenes for the horror film Closed For the Season (released in 2010) were shot at the abandoned amusement park, using many of its decrepit attractions as backgrounds.
