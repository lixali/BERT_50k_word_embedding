 "text": "The year 1967 in film involved some significant events. It is widely considered one of the most ground-breaking years in American cinema, with \"revolutionary\" films highlighting the shift towards forward thinking European standards at the time, including: Bonnie and Clyde, The Graduate, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, Cool Hand Luke, The Dirty Dozen, In Cold Blood, In the Heat of the Night, The Jungle Book and You Only Live Twice. ==Highest-grossing films== ===North America=== The top ten 1967 released films by box office gross in North America are as follows: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto; margin:auto;\" |+ Highest-grossing films of 1967 |- !

It broke many taboos of its time, such as the visual depiction of violence. It has been considered a landmark film in Hollywood filmmaking, with its groundbreaking and ingenious visual styles. The success of Bonnie and Clyde helped bring forth the New Hollywood era, a period of artistic and commercial renewal. * October 18 — Walt Disney's production of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book premieres. It was the last animated feature film to be personally supervised by Disney before his death the previous year. It was also one of the last Disney films to be personally approved by him, along with The Happiest Millionaire and Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day. The story's moral message of friendship, love, and trust have been embraced by critics and audiences worldwide. The Jungle Book is notable for its realistic character animation and voice casting. The film's soundtrack, which includes the Academy Award-nominated \"The Bare Necessities\", '\"I Wan'na Be Like You\", \"Trust in Me\", and \"My Own Home\", also contributed to the film's enormous success. It would be the most successful animated film to be made by Disney until The Rescuers, ten years later. * December 21 — The Graduate, starring Dustin Hoffman (in his acting film debut), Anne Bancroft, and Katharine Ross, premieres. It tells a story of an aimless young man, seduced and betrayed by an older woman, while falling in love with her daughter. The theme of an innocent and confused youth who is exploited, misdirected, seduced (literally and figuratively), and betrayed by a corrupt, decadent, and discredited older generation (that finds its stability in the film's keyword \"plastics\") was well understood by film audiences and captured the spirit of the times, in light of the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1963 and the increasing turbulence in American society in the mid-to-late 1960s. Like Bonnie and Clyde, The Graduate broke many well-established taboos in American cinema, and represents a new era in groundbreaking achievements in filmmaking. == Awards == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20px;\"| Category/Organization !! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:250px;\"| 25th Golden Globe Awards February 12, 1968 !! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:250px;\"| 40th Academy Awards April 10, 1968 |- ! width=200| Drama !! style=\"width:200px;\"| Musical or Comedy |- | Best Film || In the Heat of the Night || The Graduate || In the Heat of the Night |- | Best Director || colspan=\"3\" | Mike Nichols The Graduate |- | Best Actor || Rod Steiger In the Heat of the Night || Richard Harris Camelot || Rod Steiger In the Heat of the Night |- | Best Actress || Edith Evans The Whisperers || Anne Bancroft The Graduate || Katharine Hepburn Guess Who's Coming to Dinner |- | Best Supporting Actor || colspan=\"2\" | Richard Attenborough Doctor Dolittle || George Kennedy Cool Hand Luke |- | Best Supporting Actress || colspan=\"2\" | Carol Channing Thoroughly Modern Millie || Estelle Parsons Bonnie and Clyde |- | Best Screenplay, Adapted || colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Stirling Silliphant In the Heat of the Night || Stirling Silliphant In the Heat of the Night |- | Best Screenplay, Original || William Rose Guess Who's Coming to Dinner |- | Best Original Score || colspan=\"2\" | Frederick Loewe Camelot || Alfred Newman and Ken Darby Camelot Elmer Bernstein Thoroughly Modern Millie |- | Best Original Song || colspan=\"2\" | \"If Ever I Would Leave You\" Camelot || \"Talk to the Animals\" Doctor Dolittle |- | Best Foreign Language Film || colspan=\"2\" | Live for Life || Closely Watched Trains |} Palme d'Or (Cannes Film Festival): :Blowup, directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, Italy Golden Lion (Venice Film Festival): :Belle de jour, directed by Luis Buñuel, France / Italy Golden Bear (Berlin Film Festival): :Le départ, directed by Jerzy Skolimowski, Belgium ==1967 film releases== US unless stated ===January–March=== *January 1967 **5 January ***A Countess from Hong Kong (U.K.) **18 January ***The Born Losers ***Come Spy with Me ***The Venetian Affair ***Warning Shot **19 January ***Hotel **25 January ***First to Fight **26 January ***The Deadly Affair (U.K.) **27 January ***Hot Rods to Hell *February 1967 **1 February ***The Ballad of Josie **3 February ***The Corrupt Ones (West Germany)/(Italy)/ (France) **7 February ***Tobruk **8 February ***Monkeys, Go Home! **9 February ***Accident (U.K.) ***Hurry Sundown **10 February ***The Night of the Generals (U.K.)/ (France) **12 February ***Deadlier Than the Male (U.K.) **15 February ***A Covenant with Death ***Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad **18 February ***Good Morning and...
