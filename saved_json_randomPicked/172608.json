 "text": "Gerd Gudrun Maria Schyman (born 9 June 1948) is a Swedish politician. She is currently the spokesperson of Feminist Initiative, a political party she co- formed in 2005. She served as leader of the Swedish Left Party from 1993 until January 2003. She remained a member of the Left Party until 2004, when she left to focus entirely on her feminist political work following a tax evasion scandal. She remained an independent member of the Riksdag until 2006. ==Leader of the Left Party== In 1993, Schyman was elected leader of the Left Party. Schyman's greatest asset was her appeal to the voters, and her party more than doubled its number of MPs during her leadership. She gained popularity for her candor: for example, she was open about her struggle with alcoholism and supported an initiative to make the Riksdag an alcohol-free workplace.Therésia Erneborg, \"Gudrun Schyman: Det är alkohol-industrins vinstintressen som styr,\" Dagen March 1, 2003, retrieved July 26, 2011 During her period as party president, the party adopted feminism as an ideological basis. In 2003, she was charged with and later found guilty of misleading the tax authorities by attempting to take illicit tax deductions.Åsa Kroon and Mats Ekström, Vulnerable woman, raging bull or mannish maniac?: Gender differences in the visualization of political scandals, Working Paper 4, 2006, Örebro University: \"Gudrun Schyman -- Leader of the Left Wing Party 1993 – 2003,\" pp. 7–8, \"The Schyman scandal,\" pp. 9–14 (pdf) She was temporarily succeeded by Ulla Hoffmann. In 2002, she made a controversial speech concerning men's oppression of women, in which she said \"The discrimination and the violations appears in different shapes depending on where we find ourselves. But it's the same norm, the same structure, the same pattern, that is repeated both in the Taliban's Afghanistan and here in Sweden\".Text of so- called \"Taliban Speech\" to 2002 Congress of the Left Party In October 2004, Schyman together with other MEPs of the Left Party proposed before the Riksdag, a national assessment of the cost of men's violence towards women; furthermore they demanded that the state fund women's shelters.Gudrun Schyman et al., Motion 2004/05:So616 Ansvaret för mäns våld mot kvinnor, Sveriges Riksdag, October 5, 2004 The proposal attracted wide attention, with the media calling it a \"man tax\".\"Schyman in equality policy shock: tax men,\" The Local October 5, 2004, retrieved July 26, 2011. ==Founder of the Feminist Initiative== Schyman left the Left Party in 2004, and in 2005 co-founded Feminist Initiative (Fi), an organization which at its first congress decided to contest the coming parliamentary elections. Jane Fonda supported her in 2006, during the party's campaign prior to the 2006 general election. Fi received only approximately 0.7% of the vote, well below the 4% threshold required for parliamentary representation. In the 2009 European parliament elections, the party received 2.22% of the vote. In the summer of 2010—leading up to the 2010 general election—Schyman burned 100,000 Swedish krona in a protest against unequal pay in Sweden. The stunt, staged by advertising collective Studio Total, gave Fi widespread attention;Fredrik Wass, \"TV: Här bränner Gudrun Schyman 100 000,\" Makthavare.se, July 6, 2010, retrieved July 26, 2011 however, in the election the party received only 0.4% of the vote. The 2014 European Parliament election proved to be the party's most successful election so far; it attracted 5.3% of the national vote, with Soraya Post taking one seat as an MEP. In the 2014 general election Fi received 3.1% of the vote; despite still not meeting the 4.0% threshold for getting seats, it became the most popular party outside of the Riksdag. ==Notes== ==References== Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:People from Täby Municipality Category:Left Party (Sweden) politicians Category:Leaders of political parties in Sweden Category:Swedish feminists Category:Women members of the Riksdag Category:Feminist Initiative (Sweden) politicians Category:Members of the Riksdag 2002–2006 Category:21st-century Swedish women politicians",
