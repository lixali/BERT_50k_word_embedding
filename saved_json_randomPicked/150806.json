Many members of the Onondaga Nation decline to participate in the U.S. Census, as they do not consider themselves to be U.S. citizens. Therefore, census reportage of the Onondaga Reservation is notoriously untrustworthy. According to a resident speaking in 2001, at the time she spoke, there had been no non-Native residents on the reservation since 1973. ==External links== *, Onondaga Nation ==References== Category:American Indian reservations in New York (state) Category:Onondaga Category:Syracuse metropolitan area Category:Geography of Onondaga County, New York Category:Populated places in Onondaga County, New York",
