 "text": "Neville Township is a township in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. Its land area consists entirely of Neville Island, which is an island on the Ohio River. The population was 1,084 at the 2010 census. ==History== The island was formerly known as Montour's Island, named for the Native American interpreter Andrew Montour, who lived on the land in colonial times. Before the American Revolution, the island was claimed by both Pennsylvania and Virginia. Both states awarded a claim to the island to citizens of their states. The dispute found its way to the Supreme Court in Irvine v. Sims's Lessee (1799). Charles Simms won the case and gained possession of the island. It was eventually transferred to his partner in the lawsuit, General John Neville, for whom the island, and the township, is named. Neville lived on the island in his final years. The township was incorporated on April 8, 1854, from a part of Ohio Township. It obtained first-class status in 1901. A 1903 newspaper advertisement for real estate on the island promoted it as the next Manhattan Island. ==Island Sports Center== In 1998, the Hillman Company built the Island Sports Center on the western tip of Neville Island. Robert Morris University purchased the Island Sports Center in 2003. The sports center includes a 1,200-seat hockey rink, a golf range, a miniature golf course, athletic fields and a pro shop. ==Geography== The township boundary encompasses Neville Island and a surrounding portion of the Ohio River.
