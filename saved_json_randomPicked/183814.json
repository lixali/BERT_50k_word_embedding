McGuire was the only child of Thomas Johnson McGuire and Isabelle Flaherty McGuire. She made her stage debut at the age of 13 at the local community playhouse in Barrie's A Kiss for Cinderella. Her co- star was Henry Fonda, who was also born in Nebraska and was making a return visit to his home town after becoming a success on Broadway. After her father's death, McGuire attended a convent school in Indianapolis, Indiana. She later attended Pine Manor Junior College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, serving as president of that school's drama club. She graduated from Pine Manor when she was 19. ===Theatre=== McGuire appeared in summer stock at Deertrees, Maine, in 1937 before going to New York. She acted on radio, playing Sue in the serial Big Sister (1937) and took part in an experimental television broadcast, The Mysterious Mummy Case (1938). She was hired by producer Jed Harris to understudy the ingenue in a Broadway play, Stop Over (1938), which ran only 23 performances. McGuire was an understudy to Martha Scott in Our Town in 1938, eventually taking over Scott's role. She toured in My Dear Children opposite John Barrymore, and in 1939, was in a revue with Benny Goodman, Swingin' the Dream. She had a role in the short-lived Medicine Show (1940), and a part in the longer-running revival of Kind Lady (1940). McGuire gained attention on Broadway when cast in the title role of the domestic comedy Claudia.[2] It ran for 722 performances from 1941 to 1943. Brooks Atkinson wrote: \"She gives a splendid performance of a part that would be irritating if it were played by a dull actress. She is personally genuine; the charm she radiates across the play is not merely theatrical mannerism.\" ===Film=== Brought to Hollywood by producer David O. Selznick (who called her \"a born actress\") on the strength of her stage performance, McGuire starred in her first film, Claudia (1943), a movie adaptation of her Broadway success, portraying a child bride who almost destroys her marriage through her selfishness. Selznick developed the project, then sold it to 20th Century Fox; under this deal, Selznick would share McGuire's contract with Fox.SELZNICK ASSETS ACQUIRED BY FOX: Latter Buys Rights to 'Keys of the Kingdom,' 'Claudia' and Script of 'Jane Eyre' PLAYERS' SERVICES IN DEAL Joan Fontaine and Dorothy McGuire Included -- Many Contracts Involved New York Times 16 Nov 1942: 15.
