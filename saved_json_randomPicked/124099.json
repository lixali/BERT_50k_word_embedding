The entry of the United States into World War I was followed by anti-German sentiment, which extended to a town that bore the name of Germany's capital. A 1918 series of fires that destroyed a block of the town's main street was attributed to anti-German crusaders. In October 1918, less than a month before the war's end, the town's name was changed to its current Otoe. Berlin Precinct was left unchanged, however. A 1925 edition is available for download at University of Nebraskaâ€”Lincoln Digital Commons.
