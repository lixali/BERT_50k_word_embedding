The area was bought by Christopher Dabbs, a doctor from Virginia who submitted the plans for Cotton Port in 1854; it was officially recognized in 1859. It too languished until the arrival of the Vicksburg, Shreveport, & Texas Railroad and the construction of the bridge over the Ouachita. Cotton Port boomed as a river port and rail depot.http://www.antiquealleyshops.org/about.php ==Geography== According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 8.0 square miles (20.6 km), of which 7.7 square miles (20.0 km) is land and 0.2 square mile (0.6 km) (3.14%) is water.

According to long-term Mayor Dave Norris, the study confirms \"the value of many of the projects we've focused on to enhance quality of life.\" The report identifies situations in need of improvement, many of which have already been addressed, including insufficient or inaccurate signage to area attractions, brown water and the need to renovate certain wells, limited shopping opportunities for clothing, traffic problems on Thomas Road, and the failure to promote the popular phenomenon created from the West Monroe-based A&E; reality television series, Duck Dynasty.
