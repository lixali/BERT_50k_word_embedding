 "text": "New Roads (historically ) is a city in and the parish seat of Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana, United States. The center of population of Louisiana was located in New Roads in 2000. The population was 4,831 at the 2010 census, down from 4,966 in 2000. The city's ZIP code is 70760. It is part of the Baton Rouge Metropolitan Statistical Area. == History == Le Poste de Pointe Coupée (\"the Pointe Coupée Post\" or Cut Point Post) is one of the oldest communities in the Mississippi River Valley established by European colonists. The trading post was founded in the 1720s by settlers from France. It was located upstream from the point crossed by explorers, immediately above but not circled by False River. The name referred to the area along the Mississippi River northeast of what is now New Roads. The post was initially settled by native French, as well as French-speaking Creoles born in the colony. Additional ethnically French settlers migrated down the Mississippi River from Fort de Chartres, Upper Louisiana. The colonists imported numerous African slaves from the French West Indies (Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint-Domingue), and many directly from Africa, as workers for the plantations. Historian Gwendolyn Midlo Hall discovered extensive French and Spanish documentation of the early slave trade, which provided more information than is usually available as to the ethnicity and names of individual slaves, all in the court house at New Roads. Using this and other research, she has produced \"The Louisiana Slave Database and the Louisiana Free Database: 1719–1820,\" which is searchable on line. ===Commandants of Pointe Coupee (1729–1762)=== *1729: Chevalier Henri du Loubois *1731: Jean Baptiste François Tisserand de Moncharvaux *1734–38: Claude Joseph de Favrot *1738–1742: Jean Louis Richard de la Houssaye *1742–1744: Claude Joseph de Favrot *1744–1753: Jean Joseph Delfau de Pontalba, a relative by marriage of Micaela Almonester, Baroness de Pontalba, the New Orleans native who in the mid-19th century built the Pontalba Buildings and redesigned Jackson Square. *1753: Chevalier Morlière *1753–1756: Francois Artaud *1756–1759: Pierre Benoist, Sieur Payen de Noyan de Chavoy *1759–1762: Jean Louis Richard de la Houssaye ==Spanish rule== After several floods, Governor Luis de Unzaga in 1772 moved the European settlement from Pointe Coupee to a new post, the so-called Post Unzaga. Recently, historians Frank Cazorla and J. David Polo, from the Louis de Unzaga Historical Society research team, using satellite remote sensing techniques and comparative plans from the General Archive of the Indies, have managed to locate the position of the Unzaga post, which included, along with it , a parish. Unfortunately after the slave rebellion of 1795 this settlement was left uninhabited. Cazorla, Frank, The governor Louis de Unzaga (1717-1793) Pioneer in birth of the United States of America and in Liberalism, Foundation Malaga, 2019, pages 58, 133 After Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years' War (also known as the French and Indian War in North America), France ceded this territory to Spain. About 1776, the Spanish built a Chemin Neuf, French for \"New Road,\" connecting the Mississippi River with False River, a long oxbow lake and formerly the main channel of the Mississippi. In 1791, the Mina (an African people) slave uprising, the Mina Conspiracy, started on the estate of Widow Robillard at New Roads. Three years later, there was another area slave revolt near Point Coupee, the Pointe Coupée Conspiracy. ==Louisiana Purchase== In 1803 the United States made the Louisiana Purchase, and the territory became part of the United States. In-migration of American settlers increased, changing Louisiana culture. In 1822, Catherine Dispau (a free woman of color called \"La Fille Gougis\") made a four or six block subdivision out of her False River plantation. This was located at the terminus of a \"new road\" linking False River with the older Mississippi River settlement to the north. This is the area now bounded by West Main, New Roads, West Second and St. Mary Streets. The latter was named for St. Mary's Catholic Church, founded in 1823. The community was referred to variously as the \"village of St. Mary\" or Chemin Neuf. The founding of the church helped the community develop. In 1847, New Roads was named as the seat of Pointe Coupée Parish, and a courthouse was built. Between these \"strong celestial poles,\" the Main Street business district developed. After the abandonment of the competing parish port of Waterloo during 1882–84 due to flooding, New Roads became the major commercial port and city of Pointe Coupée Parish. The railroad reached the city in 1898–99, bringing much industrial development. The official name of the community changed frequently during the years after Louisiana became part of the United States. The first post office was established in 1858 as \"False River,\" but it was discontinued in 1861. When the town was incorporated by the state legislature in 1875, it was named \"New Roads.\" But, in 1878, when the post office reopened, it was named \"St. Mary's.\" In 1879, the city and post office name was changed to New Roads. The old incorporation fell into disuse. The city was reincorporated in 1892, and received its charter two years later. Several names were proposed, among them \"St. Mary\" and \"Rose Lake.\" But \"New Roads\" was finally chosen, although it was often misspelled \"New Rhodes.\" New Roads was spared any major battles during the Civil War. There were periodic raids and the Union Army briefly encamped in the Place de la Croix, the public square in front of St. Mary's. On January 31, 1865, toward the end of the war, five squadrons of Union cavalry marched into New Roads. They found five Confederate officers under the command of Colonel John S. Scott hiding in closets, under houses, and in a hole. Scott and his guerrilla forces had operated around Morganza, trading for black market supplies from Union forces in control of Baton Rouge. Union officials exchanged food, clothing, and other necessities for cotton smuggled by Scott's men.John D. Winters, The Civil War in Louisiana, Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1963, , p. 412 Since its founding, New Roads has been the hub of an agricultural community that cultivated commodity crops of sugar cane, cotton, and pecans, among others. Today, the economy has grown to support large industries such as healthcare and social assistance, construction, and retail facilities. ==Notable people== *Hewitt Leonidas Bouanchaud, politician, served as Lieutenant Governor and state House Speaker *Brian J.

The town's first recorded Mardi Gras ball was staged in 1881, and its first-known parade rolled in 1897. Today, as many as 100,000 people converge on the hospitable Creole town for family-friendly parades. New Roads' parades are civic events, open to public participation. The Community Center Carnival parade, founded in 1922 and the state's oldest outside New Orleans, rolls at 11 a.m. The New Roads Lions Carnival parade, founded in 1941 and which is staged as a charitable fundraiser, rolls at 2:00 p.m. New Roads' narrow, tree- lined streets include examples of 19th-century Creole and Victorian architecture, particularly along Main Street, Poydras Street, Pennsylvania Avenue, and North Carolina Avenue.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. Gradually sloping from a high of above sea level on Main Street immediately adjacent to False River to a low of along Portage Canal in the north, the city lies on a Mississippi River flood-plain but has never flooded to any great extent since 1912. Levee breaks or \"crevasses\" on the Mississippi River to the north and east overbanked False River and submerged all of New Roads in 1867, 1882 and 1884. The 1882 flood was the most severe, with four feet of water standing in Main Street during the height of the crisis. During the floods of 1912 and 1927, however, the southern portion of the town, including the main business district, remained dry, as the flood waters to the north and east were held back by the Texas & Pacific Railroad embankment. Mid-city flooding had periodically occurred during hurricanes and other heavy rainfall events due to the overbanking of the Portage Canal, the lowest part of the city.Costello, Brian J.

Mrs. Scott was appointed to complete his term and was thereafter elected to two full terms of her own. A former educator who attended H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College in New Orleans and Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Trina Scott was instrumental in revitalizing Main Street, increasing the size and effectiveness of the police force, and extending the municipal boundaries. Under her administration, New Roads was elevated from town to city status. During William Scott's administration, New Roads joined with the Pointe Coupee Parish Police Jury to acquire property on which to construct needed facilities. Under Mrs. Scott, the city and parish brought forth the Scott Civic Center, False River Regional Airport, playgrounds, and sports parks. Trina Scott was succeeded as mayor by Sylvester Muckelroy, the first African American in the office. Former mayor, Robert Myer, also an African American, was first elected in 2010. On August 3, 2016, Myer was indicted by a Pointe Coupee Parish grand jury on nine counts of malfeasance in office and abuse of power. From 2011 to 2014, Myer allegedly used a city-issued credit card for personal reasons. He also allegedly permitted the former municipal finance director to use the card in exchange for sexual favors. ==References== ==External links== * City of New Roads * Gwendolyn Midlo Hall, \"The Louisiana Slave Database and the Louisiana Free Database: 1719-1820\", iBiblio website * Pointe Coupee Tourism * Pointe Coupee Chamber of Commerce Category:Cities in Louisiana Category:Cities in Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana Category:Parish seats in Louisiana Category:Cities in the Baton Rouge metropolitan area",
