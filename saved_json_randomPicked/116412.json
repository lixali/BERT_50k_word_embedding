Popular tradition maintains that Church Creek predates Cambridge, Maryland as the earliest settlement in Dorchester County, and was first established at some point before 1684 under the name Dorchester Town and then White Haven.Dorchester County Resources Committee. \"This is Dorchester County, Maryland\". Cambridge, Maryland, 1952. p 46. This has been disputed by historian Elias Jones, who found no indication of land sales in the area before 1700 in County Land Records.Jones, Elias. \"New Revised History of Dorchester County, Maryland\". Cambridge, Maryland: Tidewater Publishers, 1966. pp 106-7. Both the town and river of Church Creek derive their name from the nearby Episcopal church, now known as Old Trinity Church, built c. 1675.Wroten, William H. Jr. \"The Protestant Episcopal Church in Dorchester County, 1692-1860\". Maryland Historical Magazine 45 (1950): p 106. In 1867, Church Creek officially became the forty-second Incorporated town in Maryland, and remains one of the 123 such towns today. In 1975, the town adopted its first municipal tax in order to qualify for state tax grants and federal revenue-sharing.Megargee, Frank. \"Shore Town of Church Creek Adopts Its First Tax In History.\" Evening Sun, 2 July 1975. ===Economy=== The first major industry in Church Creek was shipbuilding, established at some point before 1767, which took advantage of surrounding forests plentiful with white oak and pine. As a result, the population of the town grew during the 18th and 19th centuries. The 1860 census recorded 218 families and 1,103, of which 51 percent were occupied as \"laborers\" and 26 percent occupied as \"farmers\".Molisani, Jackie. \"1860 Census of Dorchester County, Maryland.\" USA: Family Line Publications, 1984. Toward the end of the 19th century, regional deforestation resulted in a downturn in the wooden shipbuilding industry. This adversely affected the industrial prosperity of Church Creek, and the population subsequently declined. The economy of Church Creek has historically benefited from human traffic due to the town's location at the crossroads of Taylor's Island Road (Route 16) and Church Creek-Golden Hill Road (Route 335). During the first half of the twentieth century, the residents of Church Creek maintained eight or nine general stores.Wharton, Carol. \"Sam H. Jones: Mackerel-Barrel Philosopher\". Baltimore Sun, 4 August 1946. But during the second half of the 20th century, the town's economy and population continued to decline. According to the United States Census Records, the town contained 187 people in 1950, down to 115 in 1990.\"Church Creek\".

The state passed the Public Instruction Act of 1865 to earmark public funds for the education of African-American students. But white-dominated Maryland county and city school boards refused to distribute the allocated money for the building and maintenance of African-American schools in the segregated system.Fuke, Richard Paul. \"The Baltimore Association For The Moral And Educational Improvement Of The Colored People, 1864–1870\". Maryland Historical Magazine. 66 (1971): 371–373 Instead, private organizations, such as the northern American Missionary Association, spearheaded the raising and allocation of money throughout Maryland. The fifth African-American county school was established in Church Creek on September 27, 1865 under the care of Mary S. Osbourne, with a total enrollment of thirty-two students.Fuke, Richard Paul. \"The Baltimore Association For The Moral And Educational Improvement Of The Colored People, 1864–1870\". Maryland Historical Magazine. 66 (1971): pp 377–378 The County schools were quickly opposed by local residents, sometimes violently. In October and November 1865, arsonists destroyed African-American schools in Millington, Edesville, and Kent County.Fuke, Richard Paul. \"The Baltimore Association For The Moral And Educational Improvement Of The Colored People, 1864–1870\". Maryland Historical Magazine. 66 (1971): pp 381–382 Though the school at Church Creek was not attacked, it did encounter local antagonism. In December 1865, a group of Church Creek residents held an \"indignation meeting\" to organize and communicate their opposition to the African-American school and its teacher, Mary S. Osbourne. The Church Creek school for African-American students operated successfully throughout the 1865–66 school year. As teacher Mary S. Osbourne reported: \"One class of six knew the alphabet but could not read at all; now they read well, as far as First Step No. 12 on the Chart. … A class of seven read well in the First Reader, and are to commence Arithmetic at once. Another … [is] using the Third Reader and studying Geography.\"Fuke, Richard Paul. \"The Baltimore Association For The Moral And Educational Improvement Of The Colored People, 1864–1870\". Maryland Historical Magazine. 66 (1971): pp 384 From 1861 to 1876 more than one-third of teachers in southern colored schools were African Americans, so it is likely that Osbourne was replaced by a southern African American teacher even during Reconstruction. In addition, one of every six teachers from the North were African American.Ronald E.
