 "text": "Protected areas of Tasmania consist of protected areas located within Tasmania and its immediate onshore waters, including Macquarie Island. It includes areas of crown land (public land) managed by Tasmanian Government agencies as well as private reserves. As of 2016, 52% of Tasmania's land area has some form of reservation classification, the majority is managed by the Tasmania Parks & Wildlife Service (about 42% of total Tasmanian land area). Marine protected areas cover about 7.9% of state waters. Within each classification of reserve there may be a variation of IUCN categories Australia is a signatory to the Convention of Biological Diversity and as such has obligations to report the status of its National Reserve System.IUCN provides on its website a prescription for activities consistent with the categorisation system. Changes made to the Nature Conservation Act 2002 in 2014 permit timber harvesting. These changes made in addition to the already established right to access minerals means that many of the IUCN categorisations assigned to individual reserves in Tasmania are no longer fit for purpose. In addition many reserves have had their reserve status downgraded from a class excluding timber harvesting and mineral extraction to ones where these activities are now permitted. This mis-application of the IUCN protected area categories needs to be remedied or the reserves protected land class under the Nature Conservation Act 2002 should be adjusted to reflect its currently assigned IUCN category. ==Legislation and management== *Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service manages crown land reserved under the Nature Conservation Act 2002. The 10 classes of protected land are: conservation area, historic site, game reserve, national park, nature recreation area, nature reserve, regional reserve and state reserve. The National Parks and Reserves Management act 2002 determines the management objectives for each class. *'Permanent timber production zone land' is crown land managed by Sustainable Timber Tasmania under the Forest Management Act 2013. It contains areas of informal reserves (e.g. landscape connectivity, streamside buffers, etc.) *The Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (DPIPWE) administers 'future potential production forest' crown land (formerly 'future reserve land') as defined in The Forestry (Rebuilding the Forest Industry) Act 2014. *The Wellington Park Management Trust is outlined in the Wellington Park Act 1993. ==Summary of area totals== At 30 June 2016, Tasmania's terrestrial reserves cover (about 50.1% of the area of Tasmania), of which Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service manages 823 reserves (about , or over 42% of the area of Tasmania). The following table demonstrates the distribution of terrestrial protected areas as of June 2016, any marine areas are excluded. All protected areas not managed by Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service or Sustainable Timber Tasmania is grouped into \"other\", including: formal and informal reserves on public land, reserves on private land, and Wellington Park. {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:right; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; border:none;\" !

All of the reserves are part of the South-east Commonwealth Marine Reserve Network which contains an additional 4 reserves. * Beagle * Boags * Flinders * Franklin * Freycinet * Huon * Macquarie Island * South Tasman Rise * Tasman Fracture * Zeehan ===Tasmanian marine protected areas=== Marine protected areas (MPAs) in Tasmanian state waters are classed as either conservation area, national park or nature reserve. Only the nature reserve or national park class have either restricted fishing or no take zones. Of the approximately of marine protected areas, about is restricted fishing or no take, Macquarie Island (~) is a wholly no-take zone. In total 7.9% of Tasmania's State coastal waters is reserved, however only 4.2% is in no-take areas and the majority of this is concentrated around subantarctic Macquarie Island. Only 1.1% of Tasmania's immediate coastal waters are fully protected in no-take areas. ==Private reserves== Reserves on private land is about 4% of the terrestrial protected areas in Tasmania. ===Conservation Covenant=== Landowners may protect some areas of their land by entering into a Conservation Covenant which is legally binding under the Nature Conservation Act (2002) and is registered on the land title. Although usually in perpetuity, about 7% of the covenant area in Tasmania is fixed-term. In December 2016, there were 819 covenants covering an area of about . ===Indigenous Protected Areas=== There are 8 Indigenous Protected Area in Tasmania, covering an area of about . IUCN V *Babel Island *Badger Island *Great Dog Island *lungatalanana *Mt Chappell Island *Putalina *Risdon Cove IUCN VI *Preminghana ===Private sanctuaries=== Land reserved for the significant natural or cultural values while permitting the carrying out of agricultural or other activities consistent on preserving the values of the land. ==Wellington Park== Wellington Park is the protected area which encompasses Mount Wellington and surrounds near Hobart. It is IUCN protected area category II and covers an area of about . It is managed by the Wellington Park Management Trust established in 1993 whose members include: Hobart and Glenorchy City Councils, Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service, DPIPWE, TasWater and Tourism Tasmania. ==State forest== ===Future potential production forest=== 'Future potential production forest land' (FPPF or FPPFL) is crown land administered by the Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (DPIPWE) where, except in some circumstances for \"special species timbers\", no native forest harvesting can be undertaken. It was formally classified as 'future reserve land' (FRL) under the Tasmanian Forests Agreement. FPPF may be converted to 'permanent timber production zone land' (PTPZ or PTPZL) after 2020. ====Background==== The Tasmanian Forests Agreement which was passed in 2013 after almost 4 years of negotiations, categorised about of crown land native forest as FRL, which included areas of forests of the Styx, Weld, Upper Florentine, Great Western Tiers and Tarkine regions. The fate of FRL was dependent upon Tasmanian forest practices gaining Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification. In the recent 2014 audit, Forestry Tasmania (now Sustainable Timber Tasmania) complied with 193 indicators, but needed further action on 10 more. In September 2014 the Tasmanian government passed legislation which reclassified the 400,000 hectares of FRL as FPPF. After the expiration of the memorandum in April 2020, areas of FPPF can be converted to PTPZ where native forest logging can occur, subject to parliamentary approval. Until 2020, only limited \"special species timber\" harvesting can be undertaken in FPPF. ===Permanent timber production zone land=== Sustainable Timber Tasmania is a government business enterprise owned by the Tasmanian Government which manages and operates state forest on crown land (officially classified as 'permanent timber production zone land'). Some of this land has informal protection and is managed for conservation as part of the Tasmanian CAR reserve system (e.g. habitat for threatened species, streamside protection, landscape connectivity). Informal reserves on the public production forest land cover about . ====Forest reserves==== Forest reserves are located on 'permanent timber production zone land' and may have recreation or other tourism facilities. *Brookerana *Dalgarth *Griffin *Hollybank *Jean Brook *Lawrence Rivulet *Oldina *Springfield *Tahune *Upper Natone *Wes Beckett ==Conservation areas== A protected area of land predominantly in a natural state.
