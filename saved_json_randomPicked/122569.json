 "text": "Pocahontas is a village in Cape Girardeau County, Missouri, United States. The population was 97 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Cape Girardeau- Jackson, MO-IL Metropolitan Statistical Area. ==Name== Tradition has that Samuel Green opened a post office and started the town, and was required by the government to provide a name for the town. Samuel Green had fallen in love with a princess of the Shawnee and Delaware tribes living along Apple Creek, but she had left the region along with the Shawnee and Delaware when they moved west. Green intended to name the town after this woman whom he longed for. Unfortunately, the name of this princess was difficult to pronounce and nearly as impossible to spell, so when registering the town’s name, Green instead decided to substitute his love’s name for the name of a historic Indian princess Pocahontas, of colonial Virginia fame.Mary Koeberl Rechenberg, \".\" Southeast Missourian. August 5, 2013. \"Joseph Abernathy who looked like an Indian and according to tradition was a descendant of Pocahontas, was the head of another branch of the Abernathy family. He too was born in NC and moved to MO at a very early date. The town of Pocahontas was named in honor of him and in recognition of this tradition.\"Quoted from THE ABERNATHY FAMILY by Elizabeth Denty Abernathy, 1929. This book is a compilation of articles which appeared in the Pulaski (TN) Citizen Print. ==History== The early inhabitants of the area were the Mississippian Mound Builders, who were part of the Mississippian culture. The Mound Builders went into decline in the 12th and 13th centuries, resulting in a depopulation of the area. In the latter part of the 18th century, French and Spanish officials allowed the immigration of Shawnee and Delaware Indians from Ohio. In the 1820s, these Indians were moved further west, with only a few remaining behind. The last of the Indians to stay were removed from the area in 1857. Early American settlers to the area were the Abernathy and Little families, who farmed the land around present-day Pocahontas. Samuel Green, an Englishman, purchased land from Joseph Abernathy and operated the Green Station general store and post office. The Applecreek Presbyterian Church was established in 1821 and celebrates its 200 year anniversary in 2021, German and Austrian immigrants began to settle around Pocahontas. St. John Iowa Synod Lutheran Church was founded in 1870, and in 1889 Zion Lutheran Church Missouri Synod was built. It was incorporated as a town in 1893. A flour mill was constructed by John Hatcher, and today the mill is still operated as the Bowman Milling Company. A public school and two Lutheran parochial schools were also established.
