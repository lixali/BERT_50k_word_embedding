 "text": "Sextus Empiricus (, ; flourit mid-late 2nd century AD) was a Greek Pyrrhonist philosopher and Empiric school physician. His philosophical works are the most complete surviving account of ancient Greek and Roman Pyrrhonism, and because of the arguments they contain against the other Hellenistic philosophies, they are also a major source of information about those philosophies. In his medical work, as reflected by his name, tradition maintains that he belonged to the Empiric school in which Pyrrhonism was popular. However, at least twice in his writings, Sextus seems to place himself closer to the Methodic school. Little is known about Sextus Empiricus. He likely lived in Alexandria, Rome, or Athens. The Suda, a 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, states that he was the same person as Sextus of Chaeronea,Suda, Sextos σ 235. as do other pre- modern sources, but this identification is commonly doubted.Luciano Floridi Sextus Empiricus: The Transmission and Recovery of Pyrrhonism 2002 pp 3–7. == Writings == Diogenes LaërtiusDiogenes Laërtius Lives of Eminent Philosophers \"Life of Timon\" Book IX Chapter 12 Section 116 and the SudaSuda, Sextos σ 235. report that Sextus Empiricus wrote ten books on Pyrrhonism. The Suda also says Sextus wrote a book Ethica. Sextus Empiricus's three surviving works are the Outlines of Pyrrhonism (Πυῤῥώνειοι ὑποτυπώσεις, Pyrrhōneioi hypotypōseis, thus commonly abbreviated PH), and two distinct works preserved under the same title, Adversus Mathematicos (Πρὸς μαθηματικούς, Pros mathematikous , commonly abbreviated \"AM\" and known as Against Those in the Disciplines, or Against the Mathematicians). Adversus Mathematicos is incomplete as the text references parts that are not in the surviving text. Adversus Mathematicos also includes mentions of three other works which did not survive: * Medical Commentaries (AD I 202) * Empirical Commentaries (AM I 62) * Commentaries on the Soul which includes a discussion of the Pythagoreans' metaphysical theory of numbers (AD IV 284) and shows that the soul is nothing (AM VI 55)Machuca, Diego Sextus Empiricus : his outlook, works, and legacy 2008 p. 35 The surviving first six books of Adversus Mathematicos are commonly known as Against the Professors. Each book also has a traditional title; although none of these titles except Pros mathematikous and Pyrrhōneioi hypotypōseis are found in the manuscripts. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Book !

He doubted the validity of inductionSextus Empiricus. Outlines of Pyrrhonism trans. R.G. Bury (Loeb edn) (London: W. Heinemann, 1933), p. 283. long before its best known critic David Hume, and raised the regress argument against all forms of reasoning: Because of these and other barriers to acquiring true beliefs, Sextus Empiricus advisesThe extent to which a skeptic can hold beliefs as well as the kinds of beliefs a skeptic can have is a matter of scholarly dispute. that we should suspend judgment about virtually all beliefs; that is to say, we should neither affirm any belief as true nor deny any belief as false. This view is known as Pyrrhonian skepticism, as distinguished from Academic skepticism as practiced by Carneades, which, according to Sextus, denies knowledge altogether. Sextus did not deny the possibility of knowledge. He criticizes the Academic skeptic's claim that nothing is knowable as being an affirmative belief. Instead, Sextus advocates simply giving up belief; in other words, suspending judgment (epoché) about whether or not anything is knowable.See PH I.3, I.8, I.198; cf. J. Barnes, \"Introduction\", xix ff., in Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Scepticism. Julia Annas and Jonathan Barnes (transl.) (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000). Only by suspending judgment can we attain a state of ataraxia (roughly, 'peace of mind'). Sextus did not think such a general suspension of judgment to be impractical, since we may live without any beliefs, acting by habit. Sextus allowed that we might affirm claims about our experience (e.g., reports about our feelings or sensations). That is, for some claim X that I feel or perceive, it could be true to say \"it seems to me now that X.\" However, he pointed out that this does not imply any objective knowledge of external reality. Though I might know that the honey I eat at a certain moment tastes sweet to me, this is merely a subjective judgment, and as such may not tell me anything true about the honey itself. Interpretations of Sextus's philosophy along the above lines have been advocated by scholars such as Myles Burnyeat,Burnyeat, M., \"Can The Sceptic Live His Scepticism\" in Myles Burnyeat and Michael Frede (ed.), The Original Sceptics: A Controversy (Hackett, 1997): 25–57. Cf. Burnyeat, M., \"The Sceptic in His Place and Time\", ibid., 92–126. Jonathan Barnes,Barnes, J., \"The Beliefs of a Pyrrhonist\" in Myles Burnyeat and Michael Frede (ed.), The Original Sceptics: A Controversy (Hackett, 1997): 58–91. and Benson Mates.Mates, B. The Skeptic Way (Oxford UP, 1996). Michael Frede, however, defends a different interpretation,Frede, M., \"The Sceptic's Beliefs\" in Myles Burnyeat and Michael Frede (ed.), The Original Sceptics: A Controversy (Hackett, 1997): 1–24. Cf. Frede, M., \"The Skeptic's Two Kinds of Assent and the Question of the Possibility of Knowledge\", ibid., 127–152. according to which Sextus does allow beliefs, so long as they are not derived by reason, philosophy or speculation; a skeptic may, for example, accept common opinions in the skeptic's society. The important difference between the skeptic and the dogmatist is that the skeptic does not hold his beliefs as a result of rigorous philosophical investigation. In Against the Ethicists, Sextus in fact directly says that \"the Skeptic does not conduct his life according to philosophical theory (so far as regards this he is inactive), but as regards the non-philosophical regulation of life he is capable of desiring some things and avoiding others.\" (XI, 165). Thus, on this interpretation (and as per Sextus' own words), the skeptic may well entertain the belief that God does or does not exist or that virtue is good. But he will not believe that such claims are true on the basis of reasons since, as far as the skeptic is aware, no reason for assenting to such claims has yet been shown to be \"any more\" credible than the reasons for their denial. (XIX) It must also be remembered that by \"belief\" (i.e., dogma) Sextus means \"assent to something non-evident [ἄδηλος, adēlos]\" (PH I, 16). And by \"non-evident\" he means things which lie beyond appearances (i.e., phantasiai), and thus are beyond proof or disproof, such as the existence and/or nature of causality, time, motion, or even proof itself. Thus, the skeptic will, for example, believe the proposition that \"Dion is in the room\" if sense-data and ordinary reasoning led to the emergence of such a belief. On the other hand, if he were to \"strongly\" assert that Dion was \"really\" in the room, then he may be met with opposing arguments of equal psychological force against the self-same proposition and experience mental disquietude as a result. Thus, the Pyrrhonian does not assent to the proposition \"Dion is in the room\" in a dogmatic way as that would purport to describe a non-evident reality which lies beyond the \"appearance\" [φαινόμενον, phainomenon] of Dion being in the room. The Skeptic simply goes along with the appearance just as \"a child is persuaded by...his teacher.\" (PH I, 229). It is for this reason then that Sextus says the Skeptic lives undogmatically in accordance with appearances and also according to a \"fourfold regimine of life\" which includes the guidance of nature, compulsion of pathe (feelings), laws and customs, and instruction in arts and crafts. The Skeptic follows this course of life while suspending judgment concerning the ultimate truth of the non-evident matters debated in philosophy and the sciences (PH I, 17). Thus, the Pyrrhonist achieves ataraxia not by casting certain judgments about appearances but rather through his refined ability to \"oppose appearances to judgments\" such that he is \"brought firstly to a state of mental suspense and next to ataraxia.'\" (IV, 8) == The ten modes of Pyrrhonism == Pyrrhonism is more of a mental attitude or therapy than a theory. It involves setting things in opposition and owing to the equipollence of the objects and reasons, one suspends judgement. \"We oppose either appearances to appearances or objects of thought to objects of thought or alternando.\"Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism, Trans. R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p. 23 The ten modes induce suspension of judgement and in turn a state of mental suspense followed by ataraxia. If ever one is in a position in which they are unable to refute a theory, Pyrrhonists reply \"Just as, before the birth of the founder of the School to which you belong, the theory it holds was not as yet apparent as a sound theory, although it was really in existence, so likewise it is possible that the opposite theory to that which you now propound is already really existent, though not yet apparent to us, so that we ought not as yet to yield assent to this theory which at the moment seems to be valid.\"Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism, Translated by R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p. 23 These ten modes or tropes were originally listed by Aenesidemus (see The ten modes of Aenesidemus). # \"The same impressions are not produced by the same objects owing to the differences in animals.\"Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism, Trans.

R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p.69-71 # “We deduce that since no object strikes us entirely by itself, but along with something else, it may perhaps be possible to say what the mixture compounded out of the external object and the thing perceived with it is like, but we would not be able to say what the external object is like by itself.\"Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism, Trans. R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p.73 # \"Based, as we said, on the quantity and constitution of the underlying objects, meaning generally by \"constitution\" the manner of composition.\" So, for example, goat horn appears black when intact and appears white when ground up. Snow appears white when frozen and translucent as a liquid.Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism, Trans. R.G.

Petrus and Jacobus Chouet published the Greek text for the first time in 1621. Stephanus did not publish it with his Latin translation either in 1562 or in 1569, nor was it published in the reprint of the latter in 1619. Sextus's Outlines were widely read in Europe during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, and had a profound effect on Michel de Montaigne, David Hume and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, among many others. Another source for the circulation of Sextus's ideas was Pierre Bayle's Dictionary. The legacy of Pyrrhonism is described in Richard Popkin's The History of Skepticism from Erasmus to Descartes and High Road to Pyrrhonism. The transmission of Sextus's manuscripts through antiquity and the Middle Ages is reconstructed by Luciano Floridi's Sextus Empiricus, The Recovery and Transmission of Pyrrhonism (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002). Since the Renaissance French philosophy has been continuously influenced by Sextus: Montaigne in the 16th century, Descartes, Blaise Pascal, Pierre-Daniel Huet and François de La Mothe Le Vayer in the 17th century, many of the \"Philosophes\", and in recent times controversial figures such as Michel Onfray, in a direct line of filiation between Sextus' radical skepticism and secular or even radical atheism.Recent Greek-French edition of Sextus's works by Pierre Pellegrin, with an upbeat commentary. Paris: Seuil-Points, 2002. Sextus is the earliest known source for the proverb \"Slowly grinds the mill of the gods, but it grinds fine\", alluded to in Longfellow's poem \"Retribution\".D.L.
