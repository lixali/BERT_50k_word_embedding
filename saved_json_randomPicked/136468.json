The population was 235 at the 2010 census. ==History== In the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, Mingus, known as a \"wet\" town, had a thriving set of liquor stores and bars patronized by those in \"dry\" areas in Palo Pinto County and other area counties. This era in Mingus history was memorialized in a comedic country song by John Clay and the Lost Austin Band called \"Road to Mingus.\"Although Clay performed the song informally as early as 1963 at the Monterey Folk Festival, it was first recorded in 1976 for the album \"Drifting Through The Seventies\" by John Clay and the Lost Austin Band. The lyrics tell of the deaths of three young men from Strawn, Texas, who travel to Mingus for beer, and, coming home in their '39 Ford, try to beat the Katy at a crossing and die when they are struck by the \"reckless railroad train.\" Area residents blamed aggressive law enforcement for the demise of the stores and bars. By the 2000s, the Cossacks Motorcycle Club patronized the remaining commercial establishments in the town.Lyons, Julie. \"Biker Kingdom: Who Are the Cossacks and What Happened in Waco?\" (Archive).
