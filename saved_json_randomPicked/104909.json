It incorporated in 1988. The population was 1,238 at the 2010 census. The town is included in the Mobile metropolitan area. The island (originally named Massacre Island) was renamed for Louis XIV of France's great-grandson and heir, the dauphin, the future Louis XV of France. The name of the island is often mistaken as Dolphin Island; the word dauphin is French for dolphin, but historically, the term was used as the title of the heir apparent to the French monarch. The island is one of the Mississippi–Alabama barrier islands, with the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and the Mississippi Sound and Mobile Bay to the north. The island's eastern end helps define the mouth of Mobile Bay. The eastern, wider portion of the island is shaded by thick stands of pine trees and saw palmettos, but the narrow, western part of the island features scrub growth and few trees. Dauphin Island is home to Fort Gaines, Dauphin Island Sea Lab, The Estuarium public aquarium, the Dauphin Island Airport, boat ramps, a large public pier that sits on dry land,Dauphin Island Fishing Pier .

Beaches attract tourism, and fishing is a popular activity in the waters around the island. The island is connected to the mainland by the Gordon Persons Bridge. Although the island has several bird sanctuaries, the main one is the Audubon Bird Sanctuary. Because Dauphin Island is the first land encountered by many birds as they migrate north from South America, many species can be found resting there before continuing their journey. In May 2012, the central public beach began charging for access. This marked the second beach on the island to charge the public following the creation of the privately owned West End Beach.Dauphin Island public beach fee set to begin in late May | al.com.

Shell Mound Park, along the Island's northern shore, is administered by Alabama Marine Resources Division. thumb|left|View of the southeastern shore of the island. In 1519, the Spanish explorer Alonso Álvarez de Pineda was the first documented European to visit, staying long enough to map the island with remarkable accuracy. The island's French history began on January 31, 1699, when the explorer Pierre Le Moyne, sieur d'Iberville, one of the founders of French Louisiana, arrived at Mobile Bay, and anchored near the island on his way to explore the mouth of the Mississippi River. D'Iberville mistakenly named it Île du Massacre (Massacre Island) because of a large pile of human skeletons discovered there. In reality, the site was a Mississippian burial mound which had been broken open by a hurricane, not a massacre site; however, the dramatic misnomer stuck. D'Iberville later established a port for Fort Louis de La Louisiane on the island due to its abundant timber, reliable supply of fresh water, and deep-water harbor. The settlement consisted of a fort, a chapel, government-owned warehouses, and residences. The island served as a major trading depot where goods from Saint-Domingue (Haiti), Mexico, Cuba and France were unloaded and a short-lived fur trade was conducted. Before a channel was dredged, Mobile Bay was too shallow and its sandbars too treacherous for ocean-going vessels to travel up the bay and Mobile River to Fort Louis de La Louisiane. Thus, smaller boats carried the cargo within Mobile Bay to and from Dauphin Island. In 1719 the first African slaves of Alabama arrived at Dauphin Island. After the French and Indian war known as the Seven Years' War ended in 1763, the island was ceded to the British. After the American Revolutionary War, the territory again came under Spanish jurisdiction, being part of the Province of West Florida until 1812. In 1795 after the Treaty of San Lorenzo was signed between Spain and the United States, new settlers began migrating to Alabama from Virginia, North & South Carolina and Georgia. In 1805, the Chickasaw, Cherokee and Choctaw were forced to cede their lands to the government. The Creek Tribes aggressively fought to hold their lands, but eventually were forced to cede in 1813. Fort Gaines on the eastern tip of the island was built between 1821 and 1848. It was occupied by Confederate forces in 1861 and captured by the Union Army during the Battle of Mobile Bay. The phrase, \"Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead,\" was supposedly spoken by U. S. Admiral David Farragut just a few hundred yards from Dauphin Island's shore. thumb|Typical elevated house on Dauphin Island The first Sand Island Light, authorized in 1834, was replaced by a structure high, at a cost of $35,000, that was destroyed by Confederate forces. The present lighthouse (1873; in use until 1970), has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Its ownership was recently transferred from the Department of Interior to the town of Dauphin Island. ==Geography== According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 167.1 square miles (430.1 km2), of which 6.2 square miles (16.1 km2) is land and 159.9 square miles (414.1 km2) (96.27%) is water. ===Climate=== The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters.

The boat is a shrimping vessel which represents the livelihood of many of the residents of the island. The dolphin is a mammal seen quite often in the Gulf of Mexico and Mobile Bay waters surrounding the island. The birds are pelicans, which are numerous around the island and the entire Gulf coast. The Fleur-de-lis represents the presence of France on the island from 1699–1764. The sailing ship is a Spanish galleon to represent Spain's role in settling the area between 1781–1813. == Hurricanes == Over the centuries, many hurricanes have struck the island. Some recent storms include: * In 1969, Hurricane Camille flooded 70% of the island, and was the worst storm to strike the area until Hurricane Frederic. * In 1979, Hurricane Frederic (September 12, 1979) destroyed the bridge to the mainland, which had been opened in 1955. * In 1985, Hurricane Elena brought wind gusts of over to the island. * In 1997, Hurricane Danny caused extensive flooding on the east end of the island. * In 1998, Hurricane Georges destroyed 41 houses on the island. * In 2004, Hurricane Ivan caused nearly one-fourth of the island to be covered with approximately two feet of water. * On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina brought damage to parts of Dauphin Island. Some homes on the west end of the island were destroyed, and the Katrina Cut was formed as a channel splitting off the western part. However, most areas of the Central and East end of the island experienced little flooding from the storm surge. The approach road to the island fared better than expected. The damage to most East End beachfront homes was limited to decks, stairs and storage buildings. In DeSoto Landing, a gated gulf-front subdivision on Dauphin Island, the main homes had no water entering the homes unless a window or roof system failed; many avoided surge waters entirely. Damage was limited due to Sand Island (Pelican Island), a large sandbar south of DeSoto Landing which broke the force of battering waves. An oil drilling platform grounded near the island as the hurricane passed by. It was identified by its owners, Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., as the Ocean Warwick, pushed nearly from its original location by the hurricane. * Beginning on September 14, 2020, storm surge from offshore Hurricane Sally began flooding the island. ==Tourist attractions== The old walled Fort Gaines is on the east end of Dauphin Island. A ferry from nearby Fort Morgan in Gulf Shores brings both vehicles and pedestrians to the island. One of the closest attractions to the ferry dock is The Estuarium, a fresh- and saltwater aquarium highlighting species native to Alabama. The Dauphin Island Heritage and Arts Council features works by local artists, as well as information on the history of Dauphin Island. It organizes the annual Dauphin Island Native American Festival. ==See also== * History of Mobile, Alabama * Dauphin County, Pennsylvania ==References== ==Further reading== ==External links== * Town of Dauphin Island, official website * Still in Harm's Way, NOW on PBS, Video on Dauphin Island * Dauphin Island Park and Beach Board Dauphin Island, Alabama * Dauphin Island Foundation * Historic Fort Gaines on Dauphin Island, Alabama Category:Barrier islands of Alabama Category:Towns in Mobile County, Alabama Category:Towns in Alabama Category:Populated coastal places in Alabama Category:Populated places established in 1702 Category:French-American culture in Alabama Category:Landforms of Mobile County, Alabama Category:1702 establishments in the French colonial empire",
