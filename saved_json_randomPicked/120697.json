Firefighters from five districts responded to fight the fire that burned for more than five hours Approximately 2/3 of the building was destroyed by the fire. In a letter from the Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) and it's commissioner, Gene Mammenga, dated November 13, 1991, the school board was officially informed that the school could not be rebuilt. In response, the town started a campaign to change his mind. They wrote letters and made phone calls to the MDE and the governor and created a petition. Ultimately, the campaign was successful and the rebuilding of the school was approved. Classes for the 210 7th-12th grade students were held in the town's community center and churches, and in parts of the elementary school across the street, until the new high school was completed in September 1992. The fire marshal determined that the fire was caused by a defective switch in a Bunn coffee maker.
