 "text": "Singapore Airlines (abbreviation: SIA) is the flag carrier airline of Singapore with its hub at Singapore Changi Airport. The airline is notable for using the Singapore Girl as its central figure in corporate branding. It has been ranked as the world's best airline by Skytrax four times and topped Travel & Leisure best airline rankings for more than 20 years. Singapore Airlines Group has more than 20 subsidiaries, including many airline-related subsidiaries. SIA Engineering Company handles maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) business across nine countries, with a portfolio of 27 joint ventures, including with Boeing and Rolls-Royce. Singapore Airlines Cargo operates SIA's freighter fleet and manages the cargo-hold capacity in SIA's passenger aircraft. Scoot, a wholly owned subsidiary, operates as a low-cost carrier. Singapore Airlines was the launch customer for the Airbus A380 — the world's largest passenger aircraft — as well as the Boeing 787-10 and the ultra-long-range version of the Airbus A350-900. It ranks amongst the top 15 carriers worldwide in terms of revenue passenger kilometers, and is ranked tenth in the world for international passengers carried. Singapore Airlines was voted as the Skytrax World's Best Airline Cabin Crew 2019. The airline also won the second and fourth positions as the World's Best Airlines and World's Cleanest Airlines respectively for 2019. ==History== ===Origin=== Singapore Airlines began with the incorporation of Malayan Airways Limited (MAL) on 1 May 1947, by the Ocean Steamship Company of Liverpool, the Straits Steamship Company of Singapore and Imperial Airways. The airline's first flight was a chartered flight from the British Straits Settlement of Singapore to Kuala Lumpur on 2 April 1947 using an Airspeed Consul twin-engined aircraft. Regular weekly scheduled flights quickly followed from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh and Penang from 1 May 1947 with the same aircraft type. The airline continued to expand during the rest of the 1940s and 1950s, as other British Commonwealth airlines (such as BOAC and Qantas Empire Airways) provided technical assistance, as well as assistance in joining IATA. By 1955, Malayan Airways' fleet had grown to include a large number of Douglas DC-3s, and went public in 1957. Other aircraft operated in the first two decades included the Douglas DC-4 Skymaster, the Vickers Viscount, the Lockheed 1049 Super Constellation, the Bristol Britannia, the de Havilland Comet 4 and the Fokker F27. When Malaya, Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak formed the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, the airline's name was changed, from \"Malayan Airways\" to \"Malaysian Airways\". MAL also took over Borneo Airways. In 1966, following Singapore's separation from the federation, the airline's name was changed again, to Malaysia-Singapore Airlines (MSA). The next year saw a rapid expansion in the airline's fleet and routes, including the purchase of MSA's first Boeing aircraft, the Boeing 707s, as well the completion of a new high- rise headquarters in Singapore. Boeing 737s were added to the fleet soon after. In 1970, the airline began what turned out to be very lengthy negotiations aimed at obtaining approval to operate services to the US. ===Incorporation and growth=== MSA ceased operations in 1972, and both Singapore Airlines and Malaysian Airlines System commenced operations in its place. The reason for this development was strategic: Singapore wanted to increase its international routes, but Malaysia wanted to develop its domestic network before moving on to international routes. Singapore Airlines kept all of MSA's Boeing 707s and 737s, and retained the international routes out of Singapore as well as the existing corporate headquarters in the city, with J.Y. Pillay, former joint chief of MSA, as its first chairperson. Female flight attendants continued to wear the sarong kebaya uniform, which had been first introduced in 1968. A local start-up advertising company, Batey Ads was given the right to market the airline, eventually selecting the sarong and kebaya-clad air stewardesses as an icon for the airline and calling them Singapore Girls. SIA expanded almost overnight after the split from MSA in 1972, adding cities in the Indian subcontinent and Asia to its network, and new airliners, including Boeing 747s, to its fleet. The first two 747s arrived in the summer of 1973 and were deployed on the lucrative Singapore-Hong Kong- Taipei-Tokyo (Haneda Airport) run. As of 1976, SIA had an all-Boeing fleet of 21 aircraft: 5 Boeing 737-100s, 11 Boeing 707-300s, and 5 Boeing 747-200s. The airline's passenger network covered 28 cities in 23 countries, ranging from London in the north west to Auckland in the south east. The 737s flew regional services, including most of the company's 52 flights per week to Kuala Lumpur. The larger airliners operated on longer distance routes. Flights to London were operated daily by 747s, departing from Singapore International Airport at Paya Lebar at 8.30 pm each night, but with a variety of flight numbers and routings. On Tuesday and Saturday nights at 9.00 pm, a 707 flight departed for Amsterdam. That year, SIA also operated daily 747 flights to Tokyo, daily 707 flights to Osaka, and daily flights to Sydney using a mix of 747s and 707s. Other flights went more frequently to Jakarta, Bangkok and Hong Kong, and less frequently to Perth, Melbourne and Auckland. The 707s were the company's workhorses; they flew 189 passenger flights per week. One of the 707s was configured as a 'pure' freighter, and each week it operated three out and back cargo services, to Amsterdam, Los Angeles and Paris, respectively. However, SIA passenger services to the US were still three years away. In August 1976, negotiations between SIA and the US Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) over possible SIA services to the US stalled over the key issue of the route any such services could take. SIA wanted to operate via Tokyo, the most lucrative transit point at the time, but the CAB thought that such a routing would have too significant an effect on the profits of SIA's US-based competitor, Pan Am. The CAB reportedly insisted that SIA would have to fly \"in parallel\" with Pan Am services to Singapore to earn approval, on a Singapore – Guam – Honolulu – San Francisco routing. The following year, 1977, was SIA's 30th anniversary. To mark the occasion, the airline announced in late 1976 that it would be sponsoring the second running of the London–Sydney Marathon car rally, which was to take place in August-September 1977. In March 1977, negotiations between SIA and the CAB were resumed, and in August 1977 it was reported that the airline had placed an order for four McDonnell Douglas DC-10s.McDonnell Douglas breaks Boeing's five-year hold on Singapore Airlines Freight & Container Transportation August 1977 page 4 The same month, SIA took delivery of its first Boeing 727-200 Advanced, flying the aircraft on its inaugural service from Singapore to Manila. The B727 was SIA's successor to the B737-100s that it had inherited from MSA. In late September 1977, at the end of seven rounds of negotiations, SIA and the CAB finally agreed that the airline could operate passenger services to the US, on a route to San Francisco via Hong Kong, Guam and Honolulu, initially three times per week, and increasing to five times per week by 1980. thumb|left|Concorde in Singapore Airlines livery at Heathrow in 1979. In December 1977, British Airways and SIA shared a Concorde for flights between London and Singapore via Bahrain. The aircraft, BA's Concorde G-BOAD, was painted in Singapore Airlines livery on the port side and British Airways livery on the starboard side. The service was discontinued after 4 days and three return flights because of noise complaints from the Malaysian government; it was reinstated on a new route by passing Malaysian airspace. Then, India too cited problems with the boom and did not allow Concorde from reaching supersonic speeds in Indian airspace. Determined to make the route a success, British Airways and Singapore Airlines resumed flights on 24th January 1979, this time avoiding Malaysian airspace as well as Indian's. However, the service was discontinued for good on 1st November 1980. The two carriers cited decreasing traffic as one of the reasons, with the route estimated to be costing them around £2m a year. Meanwhile, SIA extensively publicised and then introduced its new passenger services to the US. The marketing campaign, using the slogan \"California here we come\", included the painting of the slogan on many of SIA's airliners from July 1978. SIA initially planned to operate the US services using new Boeing 747-200 'Super B' aircraft, but the new jets were not going to arrive until approximately September 1979. Thus, when the airline inaugurated the route in April 1979, it did so with its new fleet of DC-10s, three of which had entered service. Operation of the first few of the US flights was hampered by a severe aviation fuel shortage in the US, due to production cuts by Iran. Then, on 25 May 1979, shortly after the fuel shortage had abated, an American Airlines DC-10 crashed in Chicago, causing 273 fatalities. Soon afterwards, and as a consequence of the crash, the US Federal Aviation Administration banned the flying of DC-10s in US airspace. SIA therefore had to switch its new US services to operation by 707s until late August 1979, when its new Boeing 747-200 'Super Bs' took over the route. The airline also sold all of its DC-10s by late 1983. The 1980s saw expanded SIA services to United States, Canada, and additional European cities with Madrid becoming the first Hispanic city to be served by SIA. Boeing 747-300s were leased and introduced into the SIA fleet in the early 1980s and named 'Big Tops'. The 747-300s replaced the 747-200s on all trans-pacific routes as well as the prime European destinations. Again a short-term affair was begun with a few Boeing 757s later followed by the addition of Airbus A310s and Airbus A300s The A310s became the Asian regional workhorse of the fleet, with the small A310-200 fleet serving until the late 1990s, and the much larger A310-300 fleet serving into the 2000s. In 1989, the first of 50 B747-400s was added to the fleet. The Airbus A340-300s augmented the 747-400s on long-range routes to Spain, Zurich, Copenhagen, San Francisco and cities not suitable for 747 service. Services extended to southern Africa in the 1990s when the airline began flights to Johannesburg in South Africa; Cape Town and Durban were later added. The 1990s also saw the opening of Terminal 2 in Changi Airport in 1991; all flight operations later moved to the new terminal. Police raided SIA's offices in Germany for offering tickets that were priced at such a low level they were allegedly illegal. The airline called a press conference condemning the police, which led to the raid being stopped. ===Modern history=== On 29 September 2000, SIA announced an order for up to 25 Airbus A3XX (as the A380 was known at the time). The US$8.6 billion order comprised a firm order of 10 aircraft, with options on another 15 airframes. The order was confirmed by Singapore Airlines on 12 July 2001. In 2003, SIA obtained 5 long range Airbus A340-500 aircraft and started the two longest nonstop flights in aviation history, Singapore – Newark and Singapore – Los Angeles. In winter 2007 SIA saw its first double decker Airbus A380-800 join the fleet. Today Singapore Airlines is the world's 2nd largest operator of the type after Emirates of the UAE. SIA employs the A380 on routes to London, Zurich, Frankfurt, Paris, Mumbai, Beijing, Sydney, Melbourne, Los Angeles and New York. SIA is also currently a far reaching global carrier and is a cornerstone member of Star Alliance. In 2004, SIA began non-stop trans-Pacific flights from Singapore to Los Angeles and Newark, utilising the Airbus A340-500. These flights marked the first non-stop air services between Singapore and the US. The Singapore to Newark flight held the record for the longest scheduled commercial flight, with a flying time of about 18 hours each way. Singapore Airlines has converted its five Airbus A340-500 aircraft from a 64 Business Class/117 Premium Economy Class configuration to a 100-seat all- Business Class configuration for its routes to Newark and Los Angeles. In January 2005, the airline unveiled the slogan \"First to Fly the A380 – Experience the Difference in 2006\", to promote itself as the first airline to take delivery of the A380-800, which was expected to take place in the second quarter of 2006. In June 2005, Airbus confirmed that due to unforeseen technical problems, initial deliveries of the Airbus A380 would be delayed by up to six months,Airbus confirms super-jumbo delay (BBC News: 1 June 2005) with the first delivery now slated for November 2006. The announcement was met with fury by SIA's chief executive officer, Chew Choon Seng, who threatened to sue Airbus, saying: \"Airbus took some time to acknowledge the delay in the timetable for the A380's entry into service...I would have expected more sincerity.\" At a Cabinet meeting on 22 February 2006, the Government of Australia decided not to grant fifth freedom rights to Singapore Airlines on flights from Australia to the United States. Singapore Airlines had argued that transpacific flights from Australia suffered from under-capacity, leading to limited competition and relatively high air fares. The move was seen as a measure taken to protect Qantas from increased competition. SIA had encountered such protectionist measures in the past when SIA was shut out from the Toronto market after complaints from Air Canada, and was forced to stop flying Boeing 747-400s into Jakarta in the wake of protests from Garuda Indonesia when it could not use similar equipment to compete. He further stated that SIA will be turning its attention to Boeing instead, since it would be receiving the Boeing 777-300ER before the A380. Nevertheless, SIA has indicated that this would not affect its promotional campaign. In February 2006, the first A380 in full Singapore Airlines livery was flown to Singapore, where it was displayed at Asian Aerospace 2006. On 14 June 2006, Singapore Airlines placed an initial order for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner as part of its future aircraft expansion. The order consisted of 20 787-9s and rights for 20 more. This order came one day after Airbus announced that the A380 Superjumbo would be delayed by another 6 months. A third delay was announced on 3 October 2006, pushing the initial delivery of the first A380 to October 2007.Airbus Confirms Further A380 Delay and Launches Company Restructuring Plan (Airbus: 3 October 2006) On 25 October 2007, the first commercial A380 service, SQ 380, carried 455 passengers from Singapore to Sydney, touching down in Sydney Airport at 3:24 pm local time, where it received significant attention from the media. The airline donated all revenue generated from the flight to three charities in a ceremony the next day in Sydney. SIA began regular services with the A380 on 28 October 2007. It eventually served London, Tokyo, Paris, Hong Kong, Melbourne, Zurich, Los Angeles as well as New York JFK (via Frankfurt) In January 2009, SIA took the decision to stop its thrice weekly flights to Vancouver, Canada as the global financial crisis had sapped demand on the route. The last flight was scheduled to take place on 25 April 2009. On 16 February 2009, the airline announced that it would remove 17 aircraft from its operating fleet between April 2009 and March 2010, as part of a cost- saving initiative to help counter falling passenger and cargo demand, having originally planned to phase out only four aircraft. The airline stated that it could not rule out delaying deliveries on aircraft already ordered. On 18 February 2009, SIA carried its one millionth A380 passenger. Singapore Airlines, along with Star Alliance partner South African Airways, was fined 25 million South African Rand (S$4.1 million) as an administrative penalty to partially settle a price-fixing investigation against the airline by the South African Competition Commission from 2008 to 2012. In 2012, SIA announced that it would order a further five more A380 planes (along with an order for 20 Airbus A350 XWB orders). On 6 April 2012, Singapore Airlines phased out the last 747 in its fleet after 40 years of service. A final round-trip commemorative flight was operated from Singapore to Hong Kong with flight numbers SQ747 and SQ748 respectively. As well as an extended flying time, special meals, performances and inflight celebrations, passengers were given well stocked 747 goody bags. The airline announced that it will end its direct flights from Singapore to both Newark and Los Angeles from 20 October and 23 November 2013, respectively. The flight to Newark was considered the longest flights in the world. However, Los Angeles will continue to be served from Singapore via Tokyo-Narita. On 13 October 2015, Singapore Airlines announced that it had signed an agreement with Airbus to be the launch customer of a new version of the Airbus A350 XWB called the A350-900ULR (for \"Ultra Long Range\"). The flights began on 11 October 2018, with regular daily commercially scheduled flights starting from 18 October 2018. This version of the A350 would have a 2 class layout, with 67 Business Class seats and 94 Premium Economy seats. SIA was the launch customer for the Boeing 787-10, and it was delivered on 25 March 2018. In 2016, the airline confirmed that one A380 would be returned to its leasing company at the end of its 10-year lease in October 2017, with a decision still to be made regarding retention of four additional A380 aircraft whose leases expire between January and June 2018. On 18 May 2018, Singapore Airlines announced that the SilkAir fleet would undergo a major cabin product upgrade from 2020 before being fully merged into the parent company. As part of the merger, SilkAir's website was discontinued and integrated into Singapore Airlines' website on 31 March 2019. Cabin upgrades were expected to begin in 2020. On 11 February 2019, Singapore Airlines announced that Thompson Aero Seating had been selected for the upgrade of the SilkAir business class seats, prior to their incorporation into the Singapore Airlines fleet, with work beginning in May 2020. In June 2018, Singapore Airlines and subsidiary Scoot listed Taiwan as part of China under the requirement of Chinese civil aviation administration. As of 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic across the country, for ensuring safety of passengers, Singapore Airlines has launched an application that works like a Digital Health Passport. The application will include all passenger information along with COVID-19 diagnosis for easy passage via the airport. On January 20, 2021, the airline has launched a one-stop online portal that will help passengers to book pre-departure COVID-19 tests. The test results will be delivered to them within 36 hours through the portal. Passengers can show these results when they check-in at the Changi Airport. Singapore Airlines recorded its worst- ever results in the last financial year (31 March 2020 to 2021), posting a record $3.2 billion annual loss and saw passenger traffic fall 97.9% due to border restrictions. ==Corporate affairs== Singapore Airlines is majority- owned by the Singapore government investment and holding company Temasek Holdings, which held 55% of voting stock as at 31 March 2020. The Singapore government, which holds a golden share via the country's Ministry of Finance, has stressed its non-involvement in the management of the company, a point emphasised by Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew when he said the Singapore Changi Airport's front-runner status as an aviation hub is more important than the SIA. However, he was personally involved in defusing tensions between the company and its pilots in the early 2000s, warned the airline to cut costs, and made public his advice to the airline to divest from its subsidiary companies. Singapore Airlines is headquartered at Airline House, an old hangar at the Changi Airport in Singapore. ===Branding=== Branding and publicity efforts have revolved primarily around flight crew, in contrast to most other airlines, who tend to emphasise aircraft and services in general. In particular, the promotion of its female flight attendants known as Singapore Girls has been widely successful and is a common feature in most of the airline's advertisements and publications. The Singapore Airlines logo is a bird, inspired by a dagger featured in regional folklore known as a silver kris or keris. The kris is central in Singapore Airlines' branding, such as the SilverKris lounge and the KrisWorld entertainment system. The logo has remained unchanged since Singapore Airlines' inception from the split of Malaysia–Singapore Airlines, except for a minor tweak in 1987.\"Mr SIA Fly Past: Introducing the life and times of a legend- Lim Chin Beng- who was instrumental in the creation of Singapore Airlines\" (2015) by Ken Hickson; . Chapter 4 Foreword ==Destinations== Singapore Airlines flies to 78 destinations in 32 countries on five continents from its primary hub in Singapore. After the Asian financial crisis in 1997, Singapore Airlines discontinued its routes to Kagoshima, Berlin, Darwin, Cairns, Hangzhou and Sendai. Toronto was discontinued in 1994. During the SARS outbreak in 2003–04, Singapore Airlines ceased flights to Brussels, Las Vegas, Chicago, Hiroshima, Kaohsiung, Mauritius, Vienna, Madrid, Shenzhen and Surabaya. Singapore Airlines discontinued flights to Vancouver and Amritsar in 2009, and São Paulo in 2016. Singapore Airlines operated two of the longest flights in the world, both nonstop flights from Singapore to Los Angeles and Newark with Airbus A340-500 aircraft. All A340-500s were phased out in 2013 and nonstop flights to both destinations were terminated. Nonstop service to Los Angeles was terminated on 20 October 2013 (the airline continues to serve Los Angeles from Singapore via Tokyo-Narita), and the nonstop service to Newark was terminated on 23 November 2013 in favour of a Singapore-New York JFK route via Frankfurt. From 23 October 2016, Singapore Airlines resumed non-stop flights from Singapore to the United States, beginning with San Francisco. The route is flown by the A350-900 aircraft and includes Business, Premium Economy, and Economy classes. This was followed by the resumption of non-stop flights to Newark and Los Angeles from 11 October 2018 and 2 November 2018, respectively, with the delivery of the Airbus A350-900ULRs, allowing the airline to operate two of the world's longest non-stop flights again. Singapore Airlines also operated flights between Singapore and Wellington via Canberra until May 2018, when the intermediate stop was changed to Melbourne. This route was known as the Capital Express. The airline has a key role on the Kangaroo Route. It flew 11.0% of all international traffic into and out of Australia in the month ended March 2008. Six destinations apiece are served in India and Australia, more than anywhere else. Singapore Airlines has taken advantage of liberal bilateral aviation agreements between Singapore and Thailand, and with the United Arab Emirates, to offer more onward connections from Bangkok and Dubai, respectively. AirAsia, a low-cost airline based in Malaysia, accused Singapore Airlines of double standards, when it claimed that the Government of Singapore attempted to keep it out of the Singapore market, although there has been no official word that Singapore Airlines has objected to the entry of AirAsia.

On 14 October 2015, Singapore Airlines announced plans to resume the world's longest non-stop flight between Singapore and Newark – a 15,300 km (9,500 mi), 19-hour route that the airline had dropped in 2013. A340-500 aircraft were formerly employed to serve this route until their retirement in 2013. SIA resumed the route following the acquisition of new Airbus A350-900ULR aircraft on 18 October 2018, but was once again suspended due to COVID-19 pandemic. On 9 November 2020, SIA relaunched the nonstop flights between Changi Airport and New York, but this time to John F. Kennedy International Airport, three times a week. Following interruptions due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, Singapore Airlines in 2022 relaunched non-stop service to the New York metropolitan area, to both New York JFK and Newark Airport, constituting the world's two longest flights at this time. ===Codeshare agreements=== Singapore Airlines codeshares with the following airlines: * Aegean Airlines * Air Canada * Air China * Air France * Air Mauritius * Air New Zealand * Air Timor * Alaska Airlines * All Nippon Airways * Asiana Airlines * Avianca * Brussels Airlines * Croatia Airlines * EgyptAir * Eurowings * Ethiopian Airlines * EVA Air * Fiji Airways * Garuda Indonesia * JetBlue * LOT Polish Airlines * Lufthansa * Malaysia Airlines * Royal Brunei Airlines * S7 Airlines * Scandinavian Airlines * Scoot * Shenzhen Airlines * South African Airways * SriLankan Airlines * Swiss International Air Lines * TAP Air Portugal * Turkish Airlines * United Airlines * Virgin Atlantic * Virgin Australia * Vistara ==Fleet== Singapore Airlines operates a fleet of 143 Airbus and Boeing passenger aircraft and seven Boeing 747-400 freighters. As of 1 April 2020, the average passenger aircraft age stands at 5 years 11 months. == Livery == === Original MSA livery (1966–1972) === In May 1966 Malaysian Airways (MAL) became Malaysia-Singapore Airlines. The MSA livery features a yellow MSA logo on the vertical stabilizer and a black nose, with a white and grey fuselage. All aircraft in such livery were repainted or retired. === Second-generation livery (1972–1987) === The second-generation livery features a blue and yellow strip on the windows on the white fuselage, with the kris bird logo. The word \"Singapore Airlines\" is stylized in italics. === Current livery (1987-present) === The current livery has only some minor changes and the gold blue colour scheme, along with the bird logo, was retained. The yellow rear fuselage was changed to metallic gold and the font typeface of the word \"Singapore Airlines\" was modified. ==Services== ===Cabins=== Singapore Airlines offers five classes of service – suites, first class, business class, premium economy class, and economy class. Major upgrades to its cabin and in-flight service were announced on 17 October 2006, constituting the first major overhaul in over eight years and costing the airline approximately S$570 million. Initially planned for the Airbus A380-800's introduction into service in 2006, and subsequently on the Boeing 777-300ER, the postponement of the first A380-800 delivery meant it had to be introduced with the launch of the first Boeing 777-300ER with the airline on 5 December 2006 between Singapore and Paris. On 9 July 2013, Singapore Airlines, in collaboration with two design firms, James Park Associates and DesignworksUSA, unveiled the next generation of cabin products for First, Business, and Economy class, which entered service onboard new Boeing 777-300ERs and Airbus A350s. London was the first city served with the new product in September 2013. The product was later extended to all Boeing 777-300ERs. On 2 November 2017, Singapore Airlines unveiled new cabin products for Suites, Business, Premium Economy and Economy Class, exclusive to the airline's Airbus A380-800 aircraft. These new changes cost roughly S$1.16 billion and were rolled out in response to growing competition from Middle Eastern carriers such as Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways. The seating configuration in the new design consists of 6 Suites and 78 Business Class seats on the upper deck, with 44 Premium Economy Class seats and 343 Economy Class seats on the lower deck. The new changes were rolled out on the five new Airbus A380 aircraft that were delivered to Singapore Airlines, while the existing A380 fleet had these new products retrofitted until 2020. Sydney was the first city served with the new product on 18 December 2017. ====Singapore Airlines Suites==== Singapore Airlines Suites is a class available only on the Airbus A380-800. The old product, introduced in October 2007, was designed by French luxury yacht interior designer Jean-Jacques Coste and consists of separate compartments with walls and doors 1.5 m high. The leather seat, upholstered by Poltrona Frau of Italy, is wide (with armrests up and wide when armrests are down) and a LCD TV screen is mounted on the front wall. The bed is separate from the seat and folds out from the back wall, with several other components of the suite lowering to accommodate the mattress. Windows are built into the doors and blinds offer privacy. Suites located in the centre (Rows 2 and 3 only) can form a double bed after the privacy blinds between them are retracted into special compartments between the beds and in the frame of the partition. There are 12 seats at the front of the lower deck of the Airbus A380-800 aircraft, with the first and last rows in a 1-1 configuration, and the second and third rows in a 1-2-1 configuration. Unveiled on 2 November 2017, the \"New A380 Suites\" are being progressively rolled out on the Airbus A380-800 fleet. They consist of six suites, manufactured by Zodiac Aerospace as separate compartments with walls and sliding doors in a 1-1 configuration on the forward upper deck. The suite itself consists of a free-standing seat and a separately deployable 76-inch (193 cm) flatbed, as well as a 32-inch (81 cm) touchscreen LCD TV, mounted on the side wall. The leather seat, also upholstered by Poltrona Frau of Italy, is able to recline 45 degrees and rotate 360 degrees. The first two suites on either side of the aircraft can form a double bed after the privacy divider is lowered, similar to the old Suites product. Additional features include a separate wireless touchscreen control tablet located upon the credenza for controlling lighting, window blinds and service calls, a Lalique personal amenity kit, an inbuilt personal closet and bag storage area, and a power socket and USB port all in a single panel.
