 "text": "Legalize It is an album and song by Peter Tosh. Legalize It was Tosh's debut album as a solo artist after leaving the Wailers. It was recorded at Treasure Isle and Randy's, Kingston, Jamaica in 1976 and released in Jamaica in the same year. Legalize It is one of the two solo albums released in 1976 by Wailers members, along with Bunny Wailer's album Blackheart Man. Bob Marley and his new Wailers also released Rastaman Vibration. The song was written in response to his ongoing victimization by the Jamaican police and as a political piece pushing for the legalization of cannabis, particularly for medical use. In 1977, Tosh backed this up by saying \"We are the victims of Rasclot circumstances. Victimization, colonialism, gonna lead to bloodbath\". Tosh also said \"Herb will become like cigarettes\", in an NME interview in 1978. ==Reception== The title track was banned when released in Jamaica in 1975. Attempts to suppress the song failed, however, catapulting Tosh to international fame. The album was released in the United States in June 1976 and appeared on the Billboard 200 album chart for two weeks, peaking at No. 199. In 1999, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for over one million copies sold. Reviewing in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: \"Unlike most sidemen who go on to pursue their own artistic interests, ex-Wailer Tosh has managed to gather about half an album for his solo debut, which ain't bad. 'Ketchy Shuby' even has the makings of a novelty hit. But oh, how his light heart and romantic spirit are missed among his old mates.\" The album was included in the 2005 book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. ==Track listing== All tracks composed by Peter Tosh; except where indicated # \"Legalize It\" – 4:35 # \"Burial\" (Tosh, Bunny Livingston) – 3:54 # \"What'cha Gonna Do?\" – 2:25 # \"No Sympathy\" – 4:35 # \"Why Must I Cry\" (Tosh, Bob Marley) – 3:08 # \"Igziabeher (Let Jah Be Praised)\" – 4:37 # \"Ketchy Shuby\" – 4:53 # \"Till Your Well Runs Dry\" (Tosh, Livingston) – 6:09 # \"Brand New Second Hand\" – 4:03 ===Sony Legacy Edition=== A Sony Legacy Edition was released in June 2011.
