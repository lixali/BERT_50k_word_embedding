 "text": "Finbar Patrick McGuigan MBE (born 28 February 1961) is an Irish boxing promoter and former professional boxer. Born in Clones, Ireland, McGuigan was nicknamed The Clones Cyclone and held the WBA and lineal featherweight titles from 1985 to 1986. At regional level he also held the British and European featherweight titles between 1983 and 1985. In 1985, McGuigan became BBC Sports Personality of the Year. In 2005 he was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. McGuigan founded, and is the current president of, the Professional Boxing Association (PBA). He is the founder and CEO of Cyclone Promotions. McGuigan is a dual citizen of both Ireland and the United Kingdom. ==Background== Barry McGuigan was born in Clones, County Monaghan, Ireland. His father was singer Pat McGuigan (died 1987). Pat McGuigan sang \"Danny Boy\" before several of his son's matches. This inspired the Hacienda Brothers' song \"If Daddy Don't Sing Danny Boy\", written by boxer and musician Chris Gaffney. As an amateur, McGuigan represented Northern Ireland in the Commonwealth Games at Edmonton in 1978 and represented Ireland at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. He became a UK citizen so that he could compete for British titles. During his professional career, McGuigan fought at a number of venues in Ireland and Britain. He attracted an enormous following in the mid-1980s, particularly to the King's Hall in Belfast which he regularly filled to capacity. McGuigan is a Roman Catholic, and at a time when Catholics and Protestants were clashing during The Troubles, he married a Protestant, Sandra Mealiff. As of 2010, they remain married after over three decades. McGuigan stated that the support he received from both Protestants and Catholics in Ireland was because: > \"[the] shadows ran deep. And my fights felt a little like sunshine. Both > sides would say: 'Leave the fighting to McGuigan.' You see, it was also > entertainment – people loved to forget the Troubles a while. The fact that I > wouldn't wear green, white and gold or put on a sign that said this is who I > represent was powerful. It was a very mature and dangerous thing to do. I > wouldn't choose sides. People appreciated that.\" As a non-sectarian sporting ambassador for Northern Ireland, he drew on the experience of Joey Dunlop and George Best. He and his wife have both been patrons for children's cancer charity CLIC Sargent. ==Amateur career== McGuigan began his juvenile boxing career at the Wattlebridge Amateur Boxing Club, County Fermanagh and later moved to the Smithborough Amateur Boxing Club, County Monaghan. Under the guidance of trainers Danny McEntee and Frank Mulligan he rapidly established himself as an exceptional boxer. He won the All Ireland Amateur Championship in 1976 having defeated Martin Brereton. Notable opponents during his teenage years included Dubliner James Coughlan, whom he defeated at the age of 15, as well as Gordon McNeil (of Heaton, Newcastle upon Tyne) and Eric Clarke (of Hackney, London). McGuigan represented Northern Ireland in the Commonwealth Games at Edmonton 1978 and represented Ireland at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. ==1980 Olympic results== Barry McGuigan competed at the 1980 Moscow Olympics as a featherweight; his record was: * Round of 32: defeated Issack Mabushi (Tanzania) referee stopped contest in third round * Round of 16: lost to Winfred Kabunda (Zambia) by decision, 1-4 ==Professional career== McGuigan began his professional boxing career on 10 May 1981, beating Selvin Bell by technical knockout (TKO) in two rounds in Dublin. After another win, he suffered his first setback, losing a hotly disputed decision to Peter Eubank (brother of Chris Eubank) over eight rounds at Corn Exchange at the Brighton Dome. After his first loss, McGuigan notched up two more wins, including one over Terry Pizzarro, and then he was given a rematch with Eubank. The second time around, McGuigan prevailed, by a knockout in the eighth round. In 1982, McGuigan won eight fights, seven by knockout. One of these, however, almost destroyed his career and his life. Opposed by Young Ali, on 14 June 1982, McGuigan won by a knockout in six rounds; Ali fell into a coma from which he never recovered. According to the book The Ring: Boxing The 20th Century. Ali's death affected McGuigan so much that he was not sure he wanted to carry on as a boxer. He also defeated Paul Huggins and Angelo Licata during this period. In 1983, he won four fights, earning the British Title against Vernon Penprase. This period marked his first trip to fight outside Europe (when he beat Lavon McGowan by a knockout in the first round in Chicago), before he got his first try at a European title. On 16 November, Italy's Valerio Nati boxed McGuigan for the vacant European Featherweight title in Belfast. McGuigan won the crown with a knockout in the sixth round. He then became the number one featherweight challenger for the WBA. In 1984, he won six bouts, all by knockout. Among the fighters he beat were former world title challengers Jose Caba and Felipe Orozco. McGuigan also overcame contenders Paul DeVorce and Charm Chiteule, retained his British and European titles against Clyde Ruan, and held on to the latter belt against Esteban Eguia to keep alive his chances of a world title fight. In 1985, McGuigan met former world featherweight champion Juan Laporte and won by a decision after ten rounds. Following one more win (a defence of his European title against Farid Gallouze), McGuigan finally earned a tilt at a world title. Long-reigning WBA featherweight champion, Eusebio Pedroza of Panama, put his title on the line at Loftus Road football stadium on London. McGuigan became the champion by dropping Pedroza in round seven and winning a unanimous fifteen-round decision in a fight refereed by hall of fame referee Stanley Christodoulou. McGuigan and his wife were feted in a public reception through the streets of Belfast that attracted hundreds of thousands of well-wishers. Later that year, he was named BBC Sports Personality of the Year, becoming the first person not born in the United Kingdom to win the award. McGuigan made his first defences against American Bernard Taylor, who was stopped in the ninth round, and Danilo Cabrera, who was knocked out in fourteen rounds. This proved to be a controversial stoppage: the fight was ended when the challenger bent over to pick up his mouthpiece after losing it, a practice that is allowed in many countries but not in Ireland. Cabrera was not aware of this rule and the fight was stopped. Although Cabrera's corner protested the outcome, McGuigan remained the winner by a knockout. For his next defence, he went to Las Vegas in June 1986, where he faced relatively unknown Steve Cruz from Texas. It proved to be a gruelling fifteen-round title bout under a blazing late- afternoon sun and 110-degree heat in the ring.'On This Day: Steve Cruz pips Barry McGuigan in a titanic Las Vegas battle' Boxing News Online McGuigan held the lead halfway through, but suffered dehydration because of the extreme heat and wilted near the end, being knocked down in rounds ten and fifteen. He eventually lost a close decision and his world belt, which he was never to reclaim. After the fight, McGuigan required hospitalisation because of his dehydrated state. 'An unforgettable pilgrimage to Caesars Palace to see Barry McGuigan' Irish Times After that fight McGuigan retired partly due to the death of his father in 1987. He used to say his father was his greatest inspiration and, after his death, apparently felt no reason to continue boxing. However, with his relationship with previous manager Barney Eastwood now at an end, McGuigan returned to the ring between 1988 and 1989, under the management of Frank Warren. He beat former world title challengers Nicky Perez and Francisco Tomas da Cruz, as well as contender Julio César Miranda, before facing former EBU featherweight champ and future WBC and WBA super featherweight challenger Jim McDonnell. McGuigan lost by TKO when a gash over his right eye, caused by a McDonnell left hook in the second round, forced the referee to stop the fight in the fourth. McGuigan then retired permanently from boxing. His record was 32 wins and 3 losses, with 28 victories by knockout. ==Professional boxing record== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! !Result !Record !Opponent !Type !Round, time !Date !Location !Notes |- |35 |Loss |32–3 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Jim McDonnell |TKO |4 (10), |31 May 1989 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |34 |Win |32–2 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Julio César Miranda |TKO |8 (10), |1 Dec 1988 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |33 |Win |31–2 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Francisco Tomas da Cruz |TKO |4 (10), |25 Jun 1988 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |32 |Win |30–2 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Nicky Perez |TKO |4 (10), |4 Apr 1988 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |31 |Loss |29–2 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| Steve Cruz |UD |15 |23 Jun 1986 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |30 |Win |29–1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Danilo Cabrera |TKO |14 (15), |15 Feb 1986 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text- align:left;\"| |- |29 |Win |28–1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Bernard Taylor |RTD |8 (15), |28 Sep 1985 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |28 |Win |27–1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Eusebio Pedroza | |15 |8 Jun 1985 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |27 |Win |26–1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Farid Gallouze |TKO |2 (12), |26 Mar 1985 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |26 |Win |25–1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Juan Laporte |PTS |10 |23 Feb 1985 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| | |- |25 |Win |24–1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Clyde Ruan |KO |4 (12), |19 Dec 1984 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |24 |Win |23–1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Felipe Orozco |KO |2 (10), |13 Oct 1984 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |23 |Win |22–1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Paul DeVorce |TKO |5 (10), |30 Jun 1984 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |22 |Win |21–1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Esteban Eguia |KO |3 (12), |5 Jun 1984 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |21 |Win |20–1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Jose Caba |TKO |7 (10) |4 Apr 1984 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| | |- |20 |Win |19–1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Charm Chiteule |TKO |10 (10) |25 Jan 1984 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |19 |Win |18–1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Valerio Nati |KO |6 (12), |16 Nov 1983 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |18 |Win |17–1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Ruben Dario Herasme |KO |2 (10), |5 Oct 1983 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |17 |Win |16–1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Lavon McGowan |KO |1 (10), |9 Jul 1983 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |16 |Win |15–1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Samuel Meck |TKO |6 (10), |22 May 1983 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |15 |Win |14–1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Vernon Penprase |TKO |2 (12), |12 Apr 1983 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |14 |Win |13–1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Paul Huggins |TKO |5 (12) |9 Nov 1982 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |13 |Win |12–1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Jimmy Duncan | |4 (10) |5 Oct 1982 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |12 |Win |11–1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Young Ali |KO |6 (8), |14 June 1982 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |11 |Win |10–1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Gary Lucas | |1 (8) |22 Apr 1982 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |10 |Win |9–1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Angelo Licata |TKO |2 (8), |23 Mar 1982 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |9 |Win |8–1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Angel Oliver |TKO |3 (8), |23 Feb 1982 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |8 |Win |7–1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Ian Murray |TKO |3 (8) |8 Feb 1982 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |7 |Win |6–1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Luis de la Sagra |PTS |8 |27 Jan 1982 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| | |- |6 |Win |5–1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Peter Eubank |TKO |8 (8), |8 Dec 1981 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |5 |Win |4–1 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| Terry Pizzaro |TKO |4 (8) |26 Oct 1981 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| | |- |4 |Win |3–1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Jean-Marc Renard |PTS |8 |3 Aug 1981 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |3 |Loss |2–1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Peter Eubank | |8 |3 Aug 1981 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| | |- |2 |Win |2–0 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Gary Lucas |TKO |4 (6), |20 Jun 1981 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |1 |Win |1–0 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| Selvin Bell | |2 (6) |10 May 1981 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |} ==After boxing== McGuigan attempted to establish an association to protect the rights of boxers against what he, and others, considered omnipotent managers and promoters. In this regard, he had had a difficult time during his own career.
