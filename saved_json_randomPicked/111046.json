They come out here to raise chickens, make gardens, and be a little more free\". Robbins was the only municipality in the north that was entirely governed by African-Americans. Kellar, who was a clerk for the Cook County Board of Assessors, was tasked with investigating the procedures of incorporation. Thomas J. Kellar School in Robbins was named in his honor and first opened for the 1954 school year. After incorporation the community became a popular recreation spot for black Chicagoans, who crowded its picnic grounds and nightclubs on summer weekends. ==Geography== According to the 2010 census, Robbins has a total area of , all land. ==Demographics== ===2020 census=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Robbins village, Illinois - Demographic Profile (NH = Non-Hispanic) !Race / Ethnicity !Pop 2010 !Pop 2020 !% 2010 !% 2020 |- |White alone (NH) |117 |240 |2.19% |5.18% |- |Black or African American alone (NH) |4,990 |3,908 |93.50% |84.42% |- |Native American or Alaska Native alone (NH) |11 |2 |0.21% |0.04% |- |Asian alone (NH) |6 |10 |0.11% |0.22% |- |Pacific Islander alone (NH) |0 |0 |0.00% |0.00% |- |Some Other Race alone (NH) |1 |20 |0.02% |0.43% |- |Mixed Race/Multi-Racial (NH) |37 |103 |0.69% |2.23% |- |Hispanic or Latino (any race) |175 |346 |3.28% |7.47% |- |Total |5,337 |4,629 |100.00% |100.00% |} Note: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category.

Robbins Airport, the first to be owned and operated by African-Americans in the United States, was located here from 1930 to 1933. It had the only flight school at the time where African-Americans could be trained as pilots, and served as a model for the Tuskegee Airmen Program during World War II. Many great African- American pilots flew into this forgotten airport. The surrounding white communities, such as Blue Island and Midlothian, did not approve of this activity, and their police sometimes arrested black pilots after they had landed in Robbins. The one-runway airport and hangar were destroyed by a tornado in 1933. School and operations were relocated by the invitation of white owners of the Harlem Airport in Chicago (it was located south of present-day Midway International Airport). From there, many of the flight school instructors entered the Tuskegee Airmen Program. One notable instructor and the man considered to be the founder of the Robbins airport was John C. Robinson, who was Supreme Commander of the Ethiopian Air Force when Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935. The activities of these men and women have been recognized by the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum.Lambertson, Giles.
