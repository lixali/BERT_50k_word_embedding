 "text": "Great Basalt Wall is a national park in Queensland, Australia, 1124 km northwest of Brisbane. This national park protects 35,200 ha of land containing the Great Basalt Wall, a geological formation of the Toomba flow. The Toomba volcano erupted approximately 20,000 years ago, covered 670 square kilometres, and flowed for 120 km. It is one of the most recent volcanic eruptions in Queensland. Due to the viscous nature of the rocky lava flows the park is not accessible to the public. ==See also== * Protected areas of Queensland * List of volcanoes in Queensland ==References== == External links == * Great Basalt Wall National Park facts and maps * Toomba, Queensland, Australia Category:National parks of Far North Queensland Category:Protected areas established in 1987 Category:1987 establishments in Australia",
