It is part of the Hope Micropolitan Statistical Area. ==History== In 1860, Charles McNab, who had emigrated to the United States in 1841 from Muthill, Perthshire, Scotland, bought land in the Red River valley not far from the town of Fulton. McNab, a carpenter, had married into a plantation-owning family in Alabama which later sold their Alabama land and moved to property at Summer Grove, near Shreveport, Louisiana. Though the Arkansas property was acquired by him in 1860, the Civil War prevented McNab from cultivating his new property. After the war, in 1865, he came up and planted cotton there. Soon, he and his wife and young son, together with a number of newly freed slaves, moved from Louisiana to live on and work the new farm. When the St. Louisâ€“San Francisco Railway (Frisco) came through the area 30 years later, a small passenger and freight station was built, and a post office to serve the small community was set up across the road in the back of the general store that was operated by the McNabs. Custom of the time allowed the person who operated the post office to give it a name. Mrs. Charles F. McNab, who was the postmistress, named it \"McNab\". Her son, Charles West McNab, who had farmed the land until 1927 and was the only grandson of the original owner, sold the last of family property there in 1956. ==Geography== McNab is located in western Hempstead County at (33.660770, -93.832374).
