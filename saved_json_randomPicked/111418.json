Rio was previously home to its own elementary school, which most humbly stands in the center of town; near the corner of Grande Avenue and North Main Street. It was opened in 1922. Due to its devastating energy costs, and lack of efficient output of students(36 students at date of closing for grades 1â€“6), coupled with other reasons, it was shut down for good in 2004. The building was purchased by Mike Gillette, who agreed to let local children utilize the modest and rusty playground equipment (which has since been removed) as a makeshift park. It has not been transformed into any business, and virtually no architectural or exterior changes have been made to it. The village of Rio owns a baseball diamond and the land plot to its west and have turned it into a park with a public pavilion and concession stand for ballgames as well as a large playground structure that was paid for by the village and constructed during a community build day in July 2012. ==References== Category:Villages in Knox County, Illinois Category:Villages in Illinois Category:Galesburg, Illinois micropolitan area",
