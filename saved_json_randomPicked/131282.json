The Borough Council has five elected members: a president, vice president, and three other committee chairs. ==History== ===Early history=== The first written records tell of the coming, by horseback and on foot, of white settlers to the vicinity about 1800. A large proportion of these were young married couples from eastern Pennsylvania, Virginia, and the north of Ireland. Something not generally known is that slavery once existed in Beaver County. In 1800 there were four slaves; in 1810 there were eight; in 1820 there were, five and in 1830 none: all having been liberated by law. In 1808 the state conveyed to Joseph Chapman a tract of land consisting of 386 acres. The plot was known as Chapman's Hall and was so named in the deed. Chapman later sold his land to James Nicholson, who came and brought from the south three colored slaves, Pompey Frazier, Tamer Frazier and Betty Mathers. Mr. and Mrs. Nicholson by deed dated May 6, 1819, conveyed to these three servants, who had so faithfully served them, the farm on which they resided. The deed, however, not to be in effect while either Mr. or Mrs. Nicholson lived. Ten years after the date of the deed Mr. Nicholson died. Shortly after Tamer Frazier also died. Pompey Frazier and Betty Mathers continued to live with Mrs. Nicholson until her death, when they became the owners of the farm. Pompey Frazier died without offspring and Betty Mathers became sole possessor of the property. Meanwhile, she had married Henry Jordan, a fiddler, in 1840 and had several sons and daughters. She sold the land and upon it the greater part of New Galilee has been built. Betty Mathers Jordan died in 1872. The stream which flows through New Galilee is named for the Jordan family \"Jordan's Run\". . The original homestead of Betty Mathers and her husband Henry Jordan was located at 709 Washington Avenue, next to the post office. ..[5] This location is now the museum of the New Galilee Historical Society and residence of the curator William Bittner. ===Founding and incorporation=== In 1854 the question was raised as to what to name the village. The citizens, most of them devout Christians, said that, \"As the small stream that flows through the village is called Jordan's Run, why not name it New Galilee as Galilee means beyond Jordan\". Application was made at the June 1867 session of court for the rights of incorporation. The application was signed by P. L. Grim, Robert Porter, J. B. Johnson, W. Thompson, John Acheson, W. D. Eakin, John Graebing, R. E. Hudson, Dr. R. J. Britain, and twenty-two others. The degree was granted January 15, 1868. The first election was held 'the third Friday of the following March, at which J. S. Hudson was judge, and W. D. Eakin and John Acheson were inspectors. The village was surveyed and platted June 13 and 14, 1876 by James Harper, County Surveyor. The northerly streets were to be Washington and Centennial Avenues. The easterly ones were to be Jackson. Jefferson, Monroe, and Madison. ===Industries=== Some industries have flourished in New Galilee. From 1860 to 1875 the Harmony Society operated two coal oil mills, one which was among the largest of its kind in the United States. It stood on the site of the Pennsylvania Railroad depot.

Co. was incorporated in 1902, and its first plant was erected the same year. In that year, the company began manufacturing paving bricks. Shortly after the paving brick facilities were operational, the company made plans to manufacture face bricks. In 1915, the company made plans to improve its operations at a cost of over $100,000. Michael Baker was the lead engineer on the improvement project. The Beaver County clay company was awarded contracts with the U.S. government during World War I, which would help bolster its output to 30-36 million bricks in 1919.

Veon, Inc. mined fire clay of the plastic variety from open pits and marketed the output for use in manufacturing fire brick and block, foundries, and heavy clay products. In addition, Ralph A.

The Gilkey Potato was first brought into Pennsylvania in 1797 by John Gilkey. Starting in Lawrence County, John Gilkey started planting three different varieties of potatoes- red, white and blue. These three potatoes quickly cross pollinated to create a new potato, which he named \"Neshannock\", after a small creek nearby. This new type of potato quickly became popular among local farmers for its productivity and better quality in taste. By 1875 this new potato was prized by Americans from Philadelphia to San Francisco. By later in the nineteenth century, the Neshannock had become the standard commercial potato of the United States. Recently, New Galilee celebrated its history with the 2014 New Galilee Potato Festival. Beginning in 2013, a circus troop was included among the festivities. ===New Galilee Community Park=== The New Galilee Community Park is situated south east of the intersection of PA Route 168 and PA Route 351.

The park ranger, Dave, walks the grounds day and night as the undisputed overlord of the village green. ===New Galilee Historical Society=== 709 Washington Avenue. Many records, photos, journals and documents along with artifacts can be seen here, along with the nations largest feral cat sanctuary. ==Landmarks and memorials== ===Veterans memorial=== In 1969, the city council earmarked $300 to erect a monument. The council planned for the monument to be placed on a 325 sq. ft., triangular lot bordered by Centennial, Washington and Maple Street belonging to Jack Walsh. Leading up to 1976, the town council had planned to place the veterans memorial on property owned by the fire hall due to its cost effectiveness. The council was dissuaded when a petition of over 150 signatures asked that the memorial be placed on the Walsh site. In August 2018, plans were made to renovate the memorial property with the removal of a blue spruce tree, several large ewe shrubs and the brick bollards along the road. The council intends on installing a small pavilion. ==Geography== New Galilee is located in northern Beaver County at (40.833271, -80.399462). It is entirely surrounded by the borough of Big Beaver.
