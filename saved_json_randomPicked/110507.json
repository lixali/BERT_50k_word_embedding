In Hawaiian the words hee ia mean \"washed away\", alluding to a victory achieved by the populace against others from leeward Oahu, aided by a tsunami that washed the combatants off the shore. Heeia includes Haikū Valley and Heeia Kea. The population was 5,001 at the 2020 census. The area is almost entirely one of homes and apartments. Parts of Heeia lie along Kāneohe Bay, but public access is non-existent owing to private ownership of the property behind the shore. Notable in the Heeia area are: * Haikū Valley, a former United States Coast Guard radio transmitter site with the Haiku Stairs * Site of the former receiving antenna tower for Station HYPO, the naval cryptanalytic station that did so much toward breaking Japanese naval codes in 1941-1942 that resulted in US victory in the Battle of Midway, seen by most historians as the turning point of the Pacific War. The site of their antenna was He'eia, NOT the site of Station HYPO itself. Station HYPO got its name from the phoenetic for the letter \"H\", because of He'eia where its antenna was sited * Heeia Fishpond, the largest remaining fishpond on Oahu Heeia Kea is a community and small, undeveloped valley separated from Heeia by Heeia Marsh and Kealohi Point. Heeia Kea Small Boat Harbor, the only public pier and boat ramp on Kāneohe Bay, is found here. Several fishponds have been restored in recent years. Although fishponds were developed on most of the islands, the largest concentrations were found in Keehi Lagoon, Pearl Harbor, and Kāneohe Bay on Oahu.
