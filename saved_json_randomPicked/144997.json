The district council was based in Lowestoft, the major settlement in Waveney. The other towns in the district were Beccles, Bungay, Halesworth and Southwold. The district was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, as a merger of the municipal boroughs of Beccles, Lowestoft and Southwold, along with Bungay and Halesworth urban districts, Wainford Rural District and part of Lothingland Rural District. The population of the district at the 2011 Census was 115,254. The last elections to the council were held on 7 May 2015, the second election after the council moved to a Whole Council election system, meaning all 48 council seats were contested.Changing to Whole Council Elections â€“ Explanatory Document, Waveney District Council, 2010.
