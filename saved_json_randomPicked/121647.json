Holmes ordered the construction of a sawmill. This establishment gave Jordan its first name, Holmes Mill. A year after the mill's founding, Thomas's brother William Holmes moved to the site and began platting a settlement. By 1855, he successfully surveyed and recorded his settlement as Jordan City, after the Jordan River in Palestine. Jordan City accumulated some success in 1855 and 1856 with the addition of a post office and a handful of a businesses. In 1860, the neighboring settlement of Brentwood was surveyed by S. A. Hooper, J. H. Gardner and R. W. Thomas. The two settlements competed until a legislative action consolidated them into the village of Jordan in 1872. The consolidation only helped the settlement and by 1880 the population had boomed to 915 along with a boom in businesses in the village. A few of these businesses were breweries, which became especially successful until prohibition in 1919 temporarily caused their closure. Jordan was finally incorporated as a city in 1891.http://www.explorejordanmn.com/about-jordan/ ==Geography== According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of ; is land and is water.
