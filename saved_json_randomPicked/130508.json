 "text": "Shady Grove was a town in southeastern Pawnee County, Oklahoma, United States, near Lake Keystone. The population was 44 at the 2000 census. In the 2010 census, its population had dropped to 2, and a 2011 news report stated that one of those two had left since the census, leaving it the smallest town in the state. The report explained that the owner of the seven mobile home lots that made up the town had incorporated it in 1997 to avoid being absorbed into a larger municipality, but had dissolved the town in 2006 and died in 2009, and nearly all the tenants had departed.Curtis Killman, \"U.S. Census shows Oklahoma communities Shady Grove, Lotsee as least populated\", The Oklahoman, May 1, 2011.
