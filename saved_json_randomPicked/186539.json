He was the head writer of the anime series Serial Experiments Lain and Digimon Tamers, as well as the television drama Ultraman Gaia. ==Personal life== Konaka gave himself the middle initial \"J\", evoking the Christian name \"John\", due to him being born to parents who were members of the Anglican Church, but he does not identify as Christian. He began using the middle initial at the age of 12, when he began making 8 mm films; he patterned the style after Western names such as Charles M. Schulz. ==Artistry and themes== Konaka's serious works generally have a dark, psychological tone. As a Cthulhu Mythos writer, he tends to add Lovecraftian elements to his works. He has cited Ghost Hound as his favorite screenwriting project. The story-line of the early episodes of Digimon Tamers was based on one of the original scripts by Chiaki and Kazuya Konaka for Gamera: Guardian of the Universe in 1995 before the final draft by Kazunori Itō. Konaka brothers' plot was later used for Digimon Tamers and Gamera the Brave in 2006.Eiga Hiho (映画秘宝), 2021, Vol.AprilHeisei Gamera Perfection (平成ガメラ パーフェクション), 2014, KADOKAWA/ASCII Media WorksChiaki J.

The drama featured the cast of the show being confronted by a physical manifestation of \"political correctness\" that uses \"cancel culture\" as an attack. This brought attention to his blog meant for retrospective commentary on Digimon Tamers, in which he also discussed conspiracy theories, and sparked international controversy. In response, Konaka posted a statement in English addressed to his overseas fans on August 8, 2021, to explain his circumstances and to apologize for triggering a divide among the fandom. == List of works == === Anime === *Air Gear: Series composition, script *Armitage III: Screenplay *Astro Boy (2003): Script *The Big O: Screenplay, script *Birdy the Mighty: Screenplay *Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040: Screenplay *Catnapped!: Screenplay *Despera: Script *Devil Lady: Script (episodes 1–5, 8, 12, 18, 25–26), series composition *Digimon Adventure 02: Scenario (episode 13) *Digimon Tamers: Series composition, script (episodes 1–3, 7, 13–14, 23–24, 34–35, 41, 44–45, 49–51) *Futari Ecchi: Script *Gasaraki: Script *GeGeGe no Kitarō (1996): Script (Episode 89 only) *Ghost Hound: Series composition, screenplay *GR: Giant Robo: Series composition *Hellsing: Series composition, script (episodes 1–6, 8–9, 11–13) *Magic User's Club: Script (eps 2–6), novelization (1,2,5,6) *Malice@Doll: Script, original story *Parasite Dolls: Script *Princess Tutu: Script (4, 9, 22, 23) *RahXephon: Screenplay (episodes 11–12, 17–18, 24–25) *RahXephon: Pluralitas Concentio: Screenplay *Serial Experiments Lain: Miniseries composition, script *Shadow Star: Series composition, script (eps 1–3, 12–13) *Texhnolyze: Series composition, script, scenario (episodes 1–4, 6, 12, 20–22) *Vampire Princess Miyu: Script (ep 20) ===Television dramas=== *Ultraman Tiga *Ultraman Gaia *Ultra Q: Dark Fantasy *Ultraman Max === Cthulhu Mythos === * Cthulhu's Strange Record * Insumasu wo Oou Kage (a Japanese television adaptation of The Shadow Over Innsmouth) * \"Terror Rate\", a short story included in Volume 2 of the Lairs of the Hidden Gods anthology (Kurodahan Press: ) === Novel === *Marebito (also screenplay of 2004 feature film) == References == == External links == * * * * Category:1961 births Category:Anime screenwriters Category:Cthulhu Mythos writers Category:Japanese screenwriters Category:Japanese horror writers Category:Living people Category:Japanese conspiracy theorists",
