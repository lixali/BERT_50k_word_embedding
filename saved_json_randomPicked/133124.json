It is part of the Williamsport Metropolitan Statistical Area. ==History== Gamble Township was formed from parts of Lewis and Cascade townships on January 30, 1875. An election of the citizens of the proposed township was 152â€“0 in favor of its creation. The drive for the formation of Gamble Township was led Ira Parker, Abraham Swartz, and J.C. Green. They started a petition and gathered the necessary signatures. Their petition was presented to Judge James Gamble who authorized the election. The results of the balloting were certified by Judge Huston Hepburn. The township is named for the judge who ordered the election. The first settler in Gamble Township was John Rose, for whom Rose Valley is named. Rose was born in Scotland in 1772. He migrated to the United States in 1794 and settled in what is now Gamble Township. Rose was accompanied to the valley by his first wife and a man named Andrew Tulloh. Rose and Tulloh cleared some land for farming but did not remain in the valley. They both moved to Williamsport in their later years. The departure of John Rose did not bring about the end of agricultural development in Gamble Township. New settlers, a majority of them Germans, continued to clear Rose Valley. Here they established dairy farms and orchards, some of which are thriving today. Salt mining and the lumbering were the primary industries found in Gamble Township during the mid-to-late 19th century. Several salt mines were built within the township. Thousands of acres of old-growth forest were cleared to meet the demands for lumber during the lumber era that swept throughout Pennsylvania. Williamsport, which is just south of Gamble Township, was known at the \"Lumber Capital of the World\". Today Gamble Township is a largely rural area with scattered dairy farms, orchards, and family homes. The population in 2010 was nearly the same as it was at the 1890 census, when the count stood at 754. ==Geography== Gamble Township is northeast of the center of Lycoming County and is bordered by Lewis Township to the northwest, Cascade Township to the north, Plunketts Creek Township to the east and southeast, Eldred Township to the south, and Hepburn Township to the southwest.
