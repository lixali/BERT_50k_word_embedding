 "text": "The Republic of Karelia (; ; ; ; , Ludic: Kard’alan tazavald), or KareliaKarelia (; ), is a republic of Russia situated in Northern Europe. The republic is a part of the Northwestern Federal District, and covers an area of , with a population of roughly 650,000 residents. Its capital is Petrozavodsk. The modern Karelian Republic was founded as an autonomous republic within the Russian SFSR by the Resolution of the Presidium of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) of 27 June 1923, and by the Decree of the VTsIK and the Council of People's Commissars of 25 July 1923, from the Karelian Labour Commune. From 1940 to 1956, it was known as the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic, one of the union republics in the Soviet Union. In 1956, it was once again an autonomous republic and remains part of Russia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. ==Geography== thumb|left|Landscape in the Republic of Karelia The republic is in the northwestern part of Russia, between the White and Baltic Seas. The White Sea has a shoreline of . It has an area of . It shares internal borders with Murmansk Oblast (north), Arkhangelsk Oblast (east/south-east), Vologda Oblast (south-east/south), and Leningrad Oblast (south/south-west), and it also borders Finland (Kainuu, Lapland, North Karelia, Northern Ostrobothnia, and South Karelia); the borders measure 723 km. The main bodies of water next to Karelia are the White Sea (an inlet of the Barents Sea) to the north-east and Lake Onega and Lake Ladoga both shared with neighboring Oblasts to the south. Its highest point is the Nuorunen peak at . ===Geology=== As a part of the Fennoscandian Shield's ancient Karelian craton, most of the Republic of Karelia's surficial geology is Archaean or Paleoproterozoic, dated up to 3.4 billion years in the Vodlozero block. This area is the largest contiguous Archaean outcrop in Europe and one of the largest in the world. Since deglaciation, the rate of post-glacial rebound in the Republic of Karelia has varied. Since the White Sea connected to the World's oceans uplift along the southern coast of Kandalaksha Gulf has totaled 90 m. In the interval 9,500–5,000 years ago the uplift rate was 9–13 mm/yr. Before the Atlantic period, uplift rate had decreased to 5–5.5 mm/yr, to then rise briefly before arriving at the present uplift rate is 4 mm/yr. ===Rivers=== There are about 27,000 rivers in Karelia. Major rivers include: * Vodla River (Vodlajoki, 149 km) * Kem River (Kemijoki, 191 km) * Kovda River (Koutajoki) * Shuya River (Suojoki) * Suna River (Suunujoki) with Kivach Falls (Kivatšun vesiputous) * Vyg River (Uikujoki) ===Lakes=== right|thumb|250px|Largest cities of the Republic of Karelia. There are 60,000 lakes in Karelia. The republic's lakes and swamps contain about 2,000 km³ of high-quality fresh water. Lake Ladoga (Finnish: Laatokka) and Lake Onega (Ääninen) are the largest lakes in Europe. Other lakes include: * Nyukozero (Nuokkijärvi) * Pyaozero (Pääjärvi) * Segozero (Seesjärvi) * Syamozero (Säämäjärvi) * Topozero (Tuoppajärvi) * Vygozero (Uikujärvi) The lakes Ladoga and Onega are located in the south of the republic. ===Islands=== White Sea coast: * Oleniy Island * Chernetskiye Island * Kamestrov Island * Kuzova Archipelago * Shuy Island * Kutulda Island * Perkhludy Island * Lesnaya Osinka Island * Kotkano Island * Vygnvolok Island * Tumishche Island * Sum Island * Razostrov Island * Sedostrov Island * Myagostrov Island * Zhuzhmuy Islands * Kondostrov Island In Lake Onega: * Bolshoy Klimenetsky Island In Lake Ladoga: * Vossinoysari Island * Valaam Island * Mantsinsaari Island * Lunkulansaari Island ===National parks=== * Vodlozero National Park * Kalevala National Park * Paanajärvi National Park ===Natural resources=== The majority of the republic's territory (, or 85%) is composed of state forest stock. The total growing stock of timber resources in the forests of all categories and ages is 807 million m³. The mature and over-mature tree stock amounts to 411.8 million m³, of which 375.2 million m³ is coniferous. Fifty useful minerals are found in Karelia, located in more than 400 deposits and ore-bearing layers. Natural resources of the republic include iron ore, diamonds, vanadium, molybdenum, and others. ===Climate=== The Republic of Karelia is located in the Atlantic continental climate zone. The average temperature in January is and in July. Average annual precipitation is 500–700 mm. ==Administrative divisions== ==History== The Karelian people and culture developed during the Viking Age in the region to the west of Lake Ladoga. The Karelians' alliance with Novgorod developed into domination by the latter in the 13th century. Around this time, Sweden's interest in Karelia began a centuries-long struggle with Novgorod (later Russia) that resulted in numerous border changes following the many wars fought between the two. In 1920, the province became the Karelian Labour Commune. In 1923, the province became the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Karelian ASSR). From 1940, it was made into the Karelo-Finnish SSR, incorporating the Finnish Democratic Republic which nominally operated in those parts of Finnish Karelia that the Soviet Union occupied during the Winter War. Annexed territories were incorporated into Karelo-Finnish SSR, but after World War II, the Karelian Isthmus was incorporated into the Leningrad Oblast. The status of Karelo-Finnish SSR was changed back to the Karelian ASSR in 1956. In 1941, Finland occupied large parts of the area but was forced to withdraw in 1944. Though Finland is not currently pursuing any measures to reclaim Karelian lands ceded to Russia, the \"Karelian question\" remains a topic present in Finnish politics. The autonomous Republic of Karelia in its present form was formed on 13 November 1991. ==Politics== thumb|Seat of the Legislative Assembly of Karelia. The highest executive authority in the Republic of Karelia is the Head of the Republic. The acting Head of the Republic is Artur Parfenchikov, who was appointed in February 2017. The parliament of the Republic of Karelia is the Legislative Assembly comprising fifty deputies elected for a four-year term. The Constitution of the Republic of Karelia was adopted on 12 February 2001. ==Demographics== Population: ===Settlements=== ===Vital statistics=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! ! width=\"70pt\"|Average

Karelian, Veps, and Finnish have been officially recognized languages of the republic since 2004, and their survival is promoted.Karelian, Vepps, and Finnish languages have got the state support in the Republic of Karelia The Official Web Portal of the Republic of Karelia (2004) Finnish was the second official language of Karelia from the Winter War 1940 (annex of Finnish territories) up until the 1980s when perestroika began. Thereafter there were suggestions to raise Karelian as the second official language, but they were repeatedly turned down. ===Religion=== The Karelians have traditionally been Russian Orthodox. Lutheranism was brought to the area by the Finnish immigrants during Sweden's conquest of Karelia and was common in regions that then belonged to Finland. Some Lutheran parishes remain in Karelia. According to a 2012 survey, 27% of the population of Karelia adheres to the Russian Orthodox Church, 2% are unaffiliated Christians, and 1% are members of Protestant churches. In addition, 44% of the population declared to be \"spiritual but not religious\", 18% is atheist, and 8% follows other religions or did not give an answer to the question. ==Economy== Karelia's gross regional product (GRP) in 2007 was 109.5 billion rubles. This amounts to 151,210 rubles per capita, which is somewhat lower than the national average of 198,817 rubles.Валовой региональный продукт на душу населения Федеральная служба государственной статистики The Karelian economy's GRP in 2010 was estimated at 127733.8 million rubles. The largest companies in the region include Karelsky Okatysh (revenues of $ billion in 2017), Segezha Pulp and Paper Mill ($ million), OAO Kondopoga ($ million). ===Industry=== The forest and wood processing sector dominates industrial activity in Karelia. A large number of small enterprises carries out timber logging whereas pulp and paper production is concentrated in five large enterprises, which produce about a quarter of Russia's total output of paper. Three largest companies in the pulp and paper sector in 2001 were: OAO Kondopoga (sales of $209.4 mln in 2001), Segezha Pulp and Paper Mill ($95.7 mln) and OAO Pitkjaranta Pulp Factory ($23.7 mln). In 2007, extractive industries (including extraction of metal ores) amounted to 30% of the republic's industrial output. There are about 53 mining companies in Karelia, employing more than 10,000 people. One of the most important companies in the sector is AO Karelian Pellet, which is the 5th largest of Russia's 25 mining and ore dressing enterprises involved in ore extraction and iron ore concentrate production. Other large companies in the sector were OAO Karelnerud, Mosavtorod State Unitary Enterprise, and Pitkjaranta Mining Directorate State Unitary Enterprise. Processing industries contributed 56,4% of the overall production in 2007. The latter figure includes pulp-and-paper (23.6%), metals and metal-working (7.9%), woodworking (7.1%), foodstuffs (5.8%) and machine-building (3.9%). Production and distribution of electricity, natural gas and water made up 13.6% of the region's output. ==Transportation== ===Railroad=== There is a federal railway (see Murmansk Railway) across Karelia that connects Murmansk Region with St. Petersburg, Moscow, the center of Russia and with Finland. The railroad crosses Petrozavodsk, Kondopoga. thumb|Vieljärvi church in Karelia Karelia has a relatively well-developed network of transport infrastructure. Water communications connect Karelia with the Barents, Baltic, Black, and Caspian Seas through the system of rivers, lakes, and canals. A federal railway (see Murmansk Railway) and automobile highways cross Karelia and connect Murmansk Region and Murmansk seaport with St. Petersburg, Moscow, the center of Russia and with Finland. Regular airline service connects Petrozavodsk with Joensuu and Helsinki in Finland. A fast fiber-optic cable link connecting Finnish Kuhmo and Karelian Kostomuksha was built in 2007, providing fast telecommunications. ===Foreign trade=== The Republic's main export partners in 2001 were Finland (32% of total exports), Germany (7%), Netherlands (7%) and the United Kingdom (6%). Main export products were lumber (over 50%), iron ore pellets (13–15%) paper and cardboard (6–9%) and sawn timber with (5–7%). Many of Karelia's companies have received investments from Finland. ==Culture== Karelia is sometimes called \"the songlands\" in the Finnish culture, as Karelian poems constitute most of the Karelo-Finnish epic Kalevala. ==See also== * Karelian Isthmus * Music of Karelia * Sami music * Pegrema ==References== ===Sources=== * ==External links== * Official website of the Republic of Karelia * Karelia.ru web server * Heninen.net – various information about Karelia * Information about Karelians * Tracing Finland's eastern border-thisisFINLAND * Saimaa Canal links two Karelias-thisisFINLAND * ProKarelia (also available in other languages) Category:Russian-speaking countries and territories Category:States and territories established in 1991 Category:1991 establishments in Russia Category:Fennoscandia",
