The population was 6,340 as of 2020. ==History== During the early 1800s, the area was inhabited by the Cherokee and Caddo Indians who dominated the East Texas woods. The Cherokees traveled a path through the area, from what is now Nacogdoches Texas to White River Arkansas where they would hunt during the summer months. This trail is known as the Cherokee Trace. In the later years of the 1800s White Oak was a small farming community with 3 sawmills located on thick forested land. By 1884 there were 15 families living in the area. Most of them had come to work the sawmills or farm the rich soil. A small school was built near Hawkins Creek which doubled as a church. Sadly, the school burned to the ground in 1885 due to suspected arson. Local land owners, Andrew J Tuttle and his father-in-law, John Bumpus, gathered a group of men in the area to erect a new school. Mr. Tuttle's uncle, Pleas Harris, and Kaleb Bumpus donated ground near a spring on which to build the new school. Andrew Tuttle and John Bumpus noticed the two White Oak trees on either side of the building. It was then decided the community would be known as White Oak. ==Geography== White Oak is located at (32.532349, -94.857638).
