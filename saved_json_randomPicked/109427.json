In 1970, Ben Novack, the Fontainebleau's original owner, grew jealous of Doris and Alfred Kaskel's plans in Doral and wanted to create his own planned golf course, resort, and community. It was to be known as Fontainebleau Park. Novack, however, soon fell into financial problems (and the Fontainebleau Park would play a part in the hotel's foreclosure in 1977). The company Trafalgar Developers would go on to develop the community under the \"Fontainebleau\" name, but no link to the famed hotel would ever be mentioned in or promotional materials when the community opened in the '70s. The community of Fontainebleau Park itself was a collection of sub-divided villages around 2-18 holes golf courses. (East and West course now closed and built upon). The original sales office for Trafalgar Development was located at what is now the Fontainebleau Office Park located at the main Fontainebleau Park entrance and West Flagler Street. Fontainebleau Park West's sales office (West of N.W. 97th Ave) at what is now \"Soleil Condominiums\". While the Eastern half of the community was heavily designed for condominiums and apartments, the Western portion of the community included \"Village Homes\", Single-Family Homes, \"Garden Homes\", and Townhomes. ==Education== Miami-Dade County Public Schools operates public schools in the Fontainebleau area.
