 "text": "thumb|right|Location The Mulde () is a river in Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. It is a left tributary of the Elbe and is long. The river is formed by the confluence, near Colditz, of the Zwickauer Mulde (running through Zwickau) and the Freiberger Mulde (with Freiberg on its banks), both rising from the Ore Mountains. From here the river runs northwards through Saxony (Grimma, Wurzen, Eilenburg, Bad D√ºben) and Saxony-Anhalt (Je√ünitz and Dessau, the old capital of Anhalt). The Mulde flows into the Elbe north of Dessau.1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica In August 2002 a flood caused severe damage, that even endangered the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Dessau-W√∂rlitzer Gartenreich\" and the city Dessau. Its name could be derived from Old German (possibly Gothic) \"Mulda\" (êåº·ö¢êåª·õû·ö®), meaning \"dust\" and a cognate of English \"mould\"). But more possibly it is related to the German \"mahlen\" which means \"to mill\". Therefore, Mulde probably means \"the milling river\" and corresponds to the great number of water mills driven by the river in former times. ==See also== *List of rivers of Saxony *List of rivers of Saxony-Anhalt ==References== * ==Notes== Category:Rivers of Saxony Category:Rivers of Saxony-Anhalt Category:Rivers of Germany",
