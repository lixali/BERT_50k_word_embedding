Cows replacing the buffalo brought an end to the plains Native Americans’ way of life. Lockwood was named after Captain Lockwood, reputed to have many victories fighting Native Americans and to have been a surveyor for the government who camped in the foothills in the late 1800s. In 1907, settlers opened a public road through Lockwood flats of heavy loam to the 2nd crossing of Dry Creek, to the Dry Creek Road traversing to the Reservation. The old Native American supply road is still etched into the side of the hill at the south end of Exxon Road which was later called Peter Hoe Road. Lockwood Flats was home of the Johnson Ranch. Just to the southeast of the ranch, one can find reminisces of Cavalry camps as they stay in the area for a whole winter surveying the land for the federal government. The area known as Lockwood Flats was also originally the site of a stop called Hirsch, located just between Johnson Lane and old Coulson Road. A community began to develop around it, however, the topographical name Lockwood stuck, and the name Hirsch was eventually forgotten. On June 16, 1965, an F3 tornado touched down near Lockwood. It was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Yellowstone County. Today, Lockwood has grown to become the largest unincorporated community in the state of Montana and the 16th largest population center in the state. Lockwood is also one of the fastest-growing communities in Montana, with an estimated 58% increase between the 2000 and 2010 censuses. In 2010, Lockwood gained status as a Census Designated Place. Residents and local businesses are working with Yellowstone County and the City of Billings to create a framework for proper infrastructure and zone planning, as well as an eventual incorporation as an official municipality. On October 24, 2013, Lockwood residents gathered for a large community meeting with 250 attendees to discuss and organize community interest, goals, and direction. Pictures of the historic meeting were recorded of the event and posted on the new [www.lockwoodmontana.com community website]. Groups were organized and champions were chosen for many different issues whether it was for a high school, incorporation, better roads, Billings bypass, community garden, community festival, water & sewer, lighting, sidewalks, and businesses. A celebration was held one year from the historic gathering to celebrate the progress that had been made. ==Demographics== As of the census of 2000, there were 6,797 people, 2,651 households, and 2,566 families residing in the CDP.
