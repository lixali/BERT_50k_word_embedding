Deposits were substantial and the demand for coal in nearby Chicago was high, so companies rushed to acquire land and set up operations. A mining boomtown sprang up, a post office was established in 1867, and the community was called Keeversville. James Braidwood was an early member of the community, and in 1872 he was hired by one company to superintend the sinking of the first deep mine shaft. The addition of more deep-shaft mines followed, and on March 4, 1873 the city was incorporated and named in Braidwood's honor. Concerning the city's early population, Donna reports, Businesses and the lives of residents were centered on the coal mines, with economic prosperity and depression occurring in their turn. Mines cut back operations during summer months, when warm weather reduced the demand for coal, leaving many miners unemployed. The disputes between coal companies and miners over wages and working conditions were always rancorous and often violent, typical for the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. On February 16, 1883, the Diamond Mine in Braidwood was suddenly flooded, resulting in the deaths of 73 miners. See 1883 Diamond Mine Disaster. There was a combination of ethnicities, providing religious and cultural diversity. At first most miners were Americans or immigrants from northern Europe. African Americans arrived from West Virginia, and many later residents would arrive as immigrants from eastern and southern Europe. == Notable people == * Kay Cannon, writer (30 Rock); Emmy nominee * Anton Cermak, immigrant from Bohemia and the 34th mayor of Chicago; worked as a miner in Braidwood. * Brian Dubois, pitcher with the Detroit Tigers; played in the state championships with Reed-Custer High School * Joseph Kain, Illinois businessman and politician * Artie Matthews, a songwriter, pianist, and ragtime composer; born in Braidwood (1888) * John Mitchell, early UMW president; born in Braidwood (1870, before incorporation); worked in the local mines as a child * Les Norman, outfielder with the Kansas City Royals; played in the state championships with Reed-Custer High School * Doug Pinnick, songwriter, bassist, and co-lead singer for rock band King's X; born and raised in Braidwood ==Cultural references== * \"Braidwood\" is a song by indie rockers The Samples, written by Andy Sheldon.
