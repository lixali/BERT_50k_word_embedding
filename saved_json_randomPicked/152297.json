 "text": "La Toya Yvonne Jackson (born May 29, 1956) is an American singer-songwriter, actress, businesswoman and television personality. The fifth and middle child of the Jackson family, Jackson first gained recognition on the family's variety television series, The Jacksons, on CBS between 1976 and 1977. Thereafter, she saw success as a solo recording artist under multiple record labels in the 1980s and 1990s, including Polydor, Sony Music and RCA, where she released nine studio albums over the course of fifteen years. Her most successful releases in the United States were her self-titled debut album (1980) and the 1984 single \"Heart Don't Lie\". Jackson's other songs include \"If You Feel the Funk\", \"Bet'cha Gonna Need My Lovin'\", \"Hot Potato\", \"You're Gonna Get Rocked!\", and \"Sexbox\". Another one of Jackson's songs, \"Just Say No\" from her fifth album was composed for US first lady Nancy Reagan and Reagan administration’s anti-drug campaign. She is a two time New York Times best selling author. Jackson posed for Playboy magazine in 1989 and again in 1991 to promote her New York Times Best Seller La Toya: Growing Up in the Jackson Family. In 1992, Jackson signed a contract with the Moulin Rouge to star in the successful Paris revue, Formidable. Despite subsequent musical success, Jackson's recording career began its decline in the 1990s as a result of her controversial marriage to entertainment manager Jack Gordon, whom she divorced in 1997. After a period of public seclusion, she returned to the music industry in 2004 with the singles \"Just Wanna Dance\", \"Home\", and \"Free the World\", which saw success on the Hot Dance Club Play chart in the United States. In 2011, she was a contestant on the fourth installment of The Celebrity Apprentice and released an extended play, Starting Over, which is her most recent release to date, called, as well, as her best-selling autobiography. From 2013 to 2014, Jackson appeared in her own reality television series on the Oprah Winfrey Network, Life with La Toya, which aired for two seasons. ==Life and career== ===1956–1979: Early life and The Jacksons=== Born on her sister Rebbie's 6th birthday on May 29, 1956 at St Mary's Mercy Hospital in Gary, Indiana, La Toya Jackson is the fifth of ten children born to Joe and Katherine Jackson and the middle female child between Rebbie and Janet. Growing up, La Toya tended to be shy. After her mother became a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses in 1965, La Toya, along with the rest of her siblings followed. She would spend some of her time alongside her mother preaching door-to-door. \"Every morning, Michael and I witnessed, knocking on doors around Los Angeles, spreading the word of Jehovah.\" By 1972, at sixteen, La Toya joined her brothers in the spotlight with a tap dancing routine when her father arranged for them to perform shows in Las Vegas, among other cities. La Toya attended the Cal-Prep school in Encino, Los Angeles, CA and graduated in 1974. Jackson aspired to be an attorney specializing in business law. She attended college for a short time before her father insisted that she pursue a career in show business like the rest of the family. In 1976 and 1977, La Toya and her sisters Rebbie and Janet appeared in all twelve episodes of The Jacksons—a CBS-TV variety program, with their brothers Jackie, Tito, Marlon, Michael, and Randy. Along with their brothers (minus Jermaine, who stayed at Motown and left the family group when his brothers moved to Epic Records), La Toya and her sisters sang, danced, and performed skits. In 1978 during the filming of The Wiz, La Toya traveled with her brother Michael (who was cast as the Scarecrow), to New York. Sharing an apartment, it was the first time either of them had lived elsewhere as adults. Close siblings, Michael and La Toya, would not move out of the family's Encino, Los Angeles, California home until they were 27 and 31 respectively. Her dates during this period included Diana Ross' brother Chico and a young David Gest.Randolph, Laura B. 'My first love': celebrities recall the first time they were hit by Cupid's arrow. Ebony magazine February 1, 1989 Jackson also dated Bobby DeBarge and was the inspiration for Switch's 1979 hit \"I Call Your Name\".Michael A. Gonzales, Vibe Magazine , September 10, 2007. Under Joe Jackson's tutelage Rebbie, La Toya and Janet formed a short-lived musical group. However, they never performed live and soon separated because of creative differences about the act's future direction. Consequently, no related material was ever released by the trio. The next year, La Toya began work on her first solo album. ===1980–1983: Beginning of solo career=== In 1980, Jackson released her self-titled debut album. In order to distinguish herself from her famous brothers, The Jacksons, La Toya only wanted her first name on the album. \"I begged just to have it 'La Toya'. But my father said, 'It's your last name. You got to use it.' But I wanted to see what I could do as an individual.\"\"Waiting for the day when she's not just 'his sister'\" Spokane Daily Chronicle, June 18, 1985 The first single \"If You Feel the Funk\", became a modest hit, climbing into the Top 40 of the US R&B; chart. Her second single, \"Night Time Lover\", was produced by younger brother Michael, who provided backing vocals and co-wrote the song with La Toya. In turn, she provided the opening scream on her brothers', The Jacksons, 1980 hit, \"This Place Hotel\" as well as backing vocals on brother Michael's 1983 solo hit \"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\". The La Toya Jackson album peaked at #116 on the US Billboard 200, #26 on the Billboard R&B; album chart, and #178 on the UK Top 200, making it her highest placing album. In 1981, Jackson released a follow-up album, My Special Love, which generated two singles, \"Stay the Night\" and \"I Don't Want You to Go\". ===1984–1987: Heart Don't Lie and international success=== 1984 saw the release of Jackson's critically acclaimed album Heart Don't Lie. Jackson scored her biggest Billboard Hot 100 hit with the title track, which peaked at number 56. Other singles from this album were \"Bet'cha Gonna Need My Lovin'\", \"Hot Potato\", and a cover of Prince's \"Private Joy.\" Jackson and Amir Bayyan co-wrote \"Reggae Nights\" for Heart Don't Lie but the track did not make the cut. Jimmy Cliff's recording of the song was a hit and was nominated for a Grammy. Cliff commissioned Jackson to write two more songs: \"Brown Eyes\" and \"American Sweet.\" In 1984, Jackson capitalized on her rising popularity by licensing her name to a fashion line; \"David Laurenz for La Toya.\" According to her three-year contract with the suede and leather-maker Jackson agreed to only wear David Laurenz items during her public appearances. Apparel in the collection included Jackson's signature leather headbands.David Laurenz, Latoya Jackson sign 3-year pact., Women's Wear Daily, April 24, 1984By Peter Carlson, Roger Wolmuth 'The Jacksons Continue to Gear Up for the Pop Cultural Event of the Year at a Pace—Slow—That Is Driving Fans and Potential Business Partners into a Frenzy' PEOPLE May 7, 1984 Vol. 21 No. 18 Jackson starred in television and print advertisements for Nikon cameras and the following year she became the spokesmodel for cosmetics firm Mahogany Image and launched her own eponymous fragrance, La Toya.Britton, A.G.La Roya a hit for Mahogany Image (La Toya Jackson) (Holiday Fragrance supplement) Women's Wear Daily September 13, 1985 In 1985, Jackson participated on the single \"We Are the World\", an appeal for famine relief in Ethiopia.

Her 1985 single \"Baby Sister\" was a notable success, as it received one of five Outstanding Song Awards at the sixteenth annual World Popular Song Festival in Japan. \"Baby Sister\" was included on the 1986 album Imagination, released just before Jackson's record label, Private-I, went bankrupt resulting in poor promotion. Jackson went on to record two duets; \"Oops, Oh No!\" with Cerrone, and \"Yes, I'm Ready\" with artist Jed. In 1987 Jackson was featured as a special guest at Minako Honda's DISPA (Disco Party) concert, joining in for the song, \"Funkytown\". ===1988–1989: Departure from the Jackson family and Playboy=== In 1987, Jack Gordon was hired to co-manage La Toya by her father, Joseph. He later took over her management completely. Under Gordon's management, Jackson's public image became increasingly sexualized. Katherine Jackson recalled her shock seeing La Toya dance in a suggestive manner in 1988 for the first time in her autobiography My Family, The Jacksons: \"she'd been so conservative that she'd once dropped a friend who had begun wearing low-cut tops and skirts with slits in them.\" Katherine believed that Gordon was distancing La Toya from her family so he could \"become the dominating influence in her life.\"Jackson, Katherine. Everything you always wanted to know about Michael, Janet and LaToya: mother of Jackson family tells all – excerpt from Katherine Jackson's 'My Family, The Jacksons' Ebony, October 1990 Around this time Jackson was disfellowshipped by the Jehovah's Witnesses. Defying her father, Jackson made a stormy exit from the family's Encino compound to take up residence in New York City.'La Toya off on her own', Chicago Sun-Times May 2, 1988 In late 1988, Jackson released the album La Toya, which featured the singles \"You're Gonna Get Rocked!\" and \"(Ain't Nobody Loves You) Like I Do\". The album also included a track titled \"Just Say No\", which was written for the Reagan administration's anti-drug campaign. The album included four tracks produced by Full Force, and three by Stock Aitken Waterman. The album was the first one Jackson released after changing her management. In March 1989, Jackson posed topless for Playboy magazine. Jackson saw the pictorial as a declaration of independence from her conservative upbringing and \"to show my parents they couldn't dictate to me any more—that I control my life.\"Randolph, Laura B. 'LaToya Jackson on: fame, family and her future in Paris' , July 1992 She posed again in Playboy in November 1991 to promote her autobiography and subsequently acted in a 1994 video for the magazine, becoming one of the first celebrities to have a Playboy video released. She later said that she initially refused to pose for the second spread and for the video, however, Gordon beat her into submission.\"'La Toya Jackson files gender-based violence suit against husband.' , Jet Magazine, July 15, 1996. In 1989, Jackson began recording her sixth album Bad Girl. That year Jackson staged a live pay-per-view concert, A Sizzling Spectacular!, from Bally's theatre in Reno. Jackson's set list included songs from La Toya and Bad Girl. The show featured special guest star Edgar Winter. ===1989–1996: Public notoriety, abuse and exile from the Jackson family=== On September 5, 1989, after her Sizzling Spectacular concert in Nevada, Gordon and Jackson were married. Jackson later claimed she had been forcibly married, with Gordon claiming it was for her own protection against kidnapping by her family. La Toya Jackson states that this was both unplanned and against her wishes. According to Jackson, \"I told him, 'No way, Jack! I can't marry you. You know what marriage means to me. I've never been in love; I don't even date... It's not right. I don't love you. I don't have feelings for you.'\" Jackson told Ebony magazine the marriage was \"strictly in name only. It has never been consummated.\" Six months into the marriage, Jackson asked Gordon for an annulment when in Rome, Italy. In response, Gordon repeatedly bashed her head against the corner of the hotel room table saying that he would never let her go. Paparazzi subsequently photographed Jackson with black eyes, which Gordon claimed were caused by an intruder.'LaToya Jackson Beaten in Rome' Los Angeles Times, June 15, 1990. From this point forward, Jackson lost all contact with her family and wrote an autobiography, La Toya: Growing Up in the Jackson Family, which accused her father of physical abuse. For roughly the next decade Gordon controlled Jackson with threats, lies, and routine domestic violence. According to Jackson, \"When he hit me, the first time I was in shock, I just recalled my ear ringing, just ringing so hard.\" Gordon confiscated Jackson's passport, transferred her bank accounts into his name, hired bodyguards to watch La Toya constantly and banned her from speaking to or seeing her family, monitoring her every phone call. La Toya's father Joseph stated in his book The Jacksons that he believed Gordon brainwashed La Toya and made her fearful of her own family. Katherine also believed that La Toya had been brainwashed while Gordon claimed that Katherine had tried to kill her daughter.Lavin, Cheryl.

Jackson was to perform two shows a night, six nights a week. Jackson was the highest-paid performer in the cabaret's history, earning a reported $5 million.

Under Gordon's management, Jackson's career declined with his booking of disreputable jobs such as spokesperson for the Psychic Friends Network. Because of Gordon's steady stream of publicity stunts and her media portrayal as the Jackson family \"black sheep\" La Toya had become a hate figure of sorts.Pratt, Paul E. , gaywired.com, 06.13.05. By the mid-1990s Jackson's finances were in disarray and she was forced to file for bankruptcy in order to stave off claims of $550,000 in damages to the Moulin Rouge for ending her contract early.Benza, A.J. & Lewittes, Michael.

'LaToya Jackson Tries New Career As 'Toy,' Says 'Michael Knows My Heart' ' MTV, September 1, 2004 Jackson's last single of the 1990s was \"Don't Break My Heart\". After separating from Gordon, Jackson cloistered herself in her home and lived alone for the first time—the first six months she stated she never actually left her house due to being terrified of Gordon seeing her. Weary after her years of public scorn, she didn't know what to do with her life and was afraid to perform again. Jackson struggled to rebuild her confidence but was plagued with self-doubt, explaining, \"I got to the point, [...] where—well, you know in the media they say things like, 'Oh, she can't sing. She has no talent. She can't dance.' I started believing that, and I was thinking, 'Oh my God'. And I started thinking, 'Oh gee, how could this happen to me?' How could I start believing this?\" After this time she started to perform in Europe and South America occasionally to start making money to pay off the huge debts which Gordon had accumulated in her name while they were married. In the wake of the September 11 attacks Jackson was moved to compose \"Free the World\". She performed the song for friends to a positive reception. This spurred on Jackson to write more songs, ending up with a full album, Startin' Over. ===2003–2006: Re-emergence and return to music=== Jackson publicly re-emerged on Larry King Live on March 9, 2003. Her appearance caused CNN's phone lines to stay busy for hours and was King's highest-rated show in three years. Jackson announced her first musical project in six years, Startin' Over. Startin' Over's lead single was 2004's \"Just Wanna Dance\", released independently under her pseudonymous nickname \"Toy\" in order to avoid any prejudices DJs might hold against La Toya Jackson's name. The plan worked, with \"Just Wanna Dance\" reaching #13 on the US Billboard Hot Dance chart. \"Free the World\" was released later that year to similar success. Jackson's label, Ja-Tail Records secured a deal with Universal Music Group to distribute the album, which was delayed several times due to extenuating circumstances.

The show was eventually removed from the CBS lineup, due to its inability to compete with American Idol. VH1 subsequently aired the remaining episodes. On the show, Jackson demonstrated her phobia of cats, after she began hysterically screaming and locked herself in a squad car. This fear, she revealed, was caused by a childhood memory in which a relative was attacked by a cat. She underwent on- screen therapy to try to relieve her of this phobia. A single called \"Armed and Famous\" was planned but the title was changed to \"I Don't Play That\" shortly before it was sent to radio stations, where it failed to take off, on January 29, 2007, due to CBS' cancellation of the show.

Like her siblings, Michael and Janet, she is mainly a pop, R&B;, and dance music performer but she has also dabbled in rock as heard in her song, \"No More Drama\" and reggae in her signature song \"Heart Don't Lie\", as well as country music. Like many other Jacksons, most notably Michael, she cites James Brown as a \"major influence\". When Jackson headlined the Moulin Rouge she paid homage to La Goulue and cited Josephine Baker as an influence. L'Express hailed Jackson as \"the new Josephine Baker.\" According to academic Bennetta Jules-Rosette, \"Through careful planning, she was able to model a successful part of her career abroad on the master tropes of a Baker-like image.
