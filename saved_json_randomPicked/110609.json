Its population was 131 at the 2010 census, down from 156 in 2000. ==Description== Ranching and recreation are the major influences on the community. Its small population live in houses scattered through a number of blocks of rustic streets interspersed with fields and agricultural buildings. A number of summer homes for visitors to the lake have added to the community. St. Charles sits at the mouth of St. Charles Canyon, a scenic inlet into the neighboring mountains, where hiking and camping opportunities are available. ==History== St. Charles was settled in May 1864 by Mormon pioneers. As did most Mormon communities along the Idaho–Utah border, early settlers believed they were in the Territory of Utah. In 1864, the Utah territorial legislature created Richland County (shortened to Rich in 1868) for the Bear Lake Valley settlements, designating St. Charles as its county seat. The 1870 Decennial Census of the United States listed St. Charles and 10 other Idaho Bear Lake Valley settlements under Rich County, Utah. But when the official survey of the Idaho–Utah line was completed on February 15, 1872, it placed St. Charles and the rest of the northern Bear Lake Valley settlements in Oneida County, Idaho Territory. The area developed as an agricultural community, and the population was never substantial. In the 20th century it began to attract tourists and persons seeking a recreation area. Some second homes and retirement homes have been built here, but the population has declined. ==Notable residents== Sculptor Gutzon Borglum (1867–1941) was born in St. Charles to Danish immigrant parents.
