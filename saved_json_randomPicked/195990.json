 "text": "In mathematics, a polynomial sequence is a sequence of polynomials indexed by the nonnegative integers 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., in which each index is equal to the degree of the corresponding polynomial. Polynomial sequences are a topic of interest in enumerative combinatorics and algebraic combinatorics, as well as applied mathematics. ==Examples== Some polynomial sequences arise in physics and approximation theory as the solutions of certain ordinary differential equations: * Laguerre polynomials * Chebyshev polynomials * Legendre polynomials * Jacobi polynomials Others come from statistics: * Hermite polynomials Many are studied in algebra and combinatorics: * Monomials * Rising factorials * Falling factorials * All-one polynomials * Abel polynomials * Bell polynomials * Bernoulli polynomials * Cyclotomic polynomials * Dickson polynomials * Fibonacci polynomials * Lagrange polynomials * Lucas polynomials * Spread polynomials * Touchard polynomials * Rook polynomials ==Classes of polynomial sequences== * Polynomial sequences of binomial type * Orthogonal polynomials * Secondary polynomials * Sheffer sequence * Sturm sequence * Generalized Appell polynomials ==See also== *Umbral calculus ==References== * Aigner, Martin. \"A course in enumeration\", GTM Springer, 2007, p21. * Roman, Steven \"The Umbral Calculus\", Dover Publications, 2005, . * Williamson, S.
