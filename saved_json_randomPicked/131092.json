Westbound I-376 from Churchill goes to Interstate 279 and downtown Pittsburgh, while eastbound I-376 goes to the Pennsylvania Turnpike. In addition, U.S. Route 22 (on the same road as I-376) travels through Churchill. Several bus lines of the Port Authority of Allegheny County travel through Churchill, offering service to downtown Pittsburgh west of Churchill, and also to Monroeville east of Pittsburgh, where Monroeville Mall and several Port Authority park-and-ride lots for bus commuters are located. The Parkway East used to end at Churchill (in the traffic configuration just before it was extended to the Turnpike at Monroeville), with traffic having to continue ahead on U.S. 22—now business U.S. 22—to get from there to the Pennsylvania Turnpike. When the Parkway East ended there, there was a black-lettering-on-white-background sign \"PARKWAY ENDS\", because straight ahead there began to be grade-level intersections. == Education == Churchill is served by the Woodland Hills School District. ==See also== * Blackridge, Pennsylvania ==References== Category:Populated places established in 1934 Category:Pittsburgh metropolitan area Category:Boroughs in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Category:1934 establishments in Pennsylvania",
