 "text": "Anton ( ) is a city in Hockley County, Texas, United States. The population was 1,126 at the 2010 census. ==History== Anton was founded in 1924 near the center of the north pasture of the former Spade Ranch when ranch owner William Leonard Ellwood contracted with the Anton Townsite Company to plat a town at the site of Danforth Switch, a spur of the Pecos and Northern Texas Railway. The town was named in honor of J.F. Anton, a Santa Fe railroad executive. Anton's first mayor was Paul Grover Whitfield, who was born in July 1908, so in 1924 was only 16 or 17 years old. He told everyone he was 18, so was able to accept the position. He is, therefore, on record as being the youngest mayor ever in Texas at the time, and since he was under 18, the record stands to this day and likely will for all time. Whether an election was held or if he simply volunteered for the position is unclear. In those days, identification was not required because most agreements were done with a handshake. ==Geography== Anton sits just to the east of the geographic center of the level High Plains of the Llano Estacado. The flat terrain is broken to the west by a dry watercourse called Yellow House Draw, which passes about to the southwest of Anton. Anton is well situated with regard to transportation.
