 "text": "Batman Fights Dr√°cula is a 1967 Filipino film directed by Leody M. Diaz and scripted by Bert R. Mendoza. The film, which was not authorized by DC, is thought to be lost. This film marks the first time Batman interacted with Dracula, a concept which would be explored in Batman: Red Rain, and The Batman vs. Dracula. ==Synopsis== The story concerned the mad scientist named Dr. Zorba who, after repeatedly being defeated by Batman, finds a way to resurrect the wicked Count Dracula, control him, and even make him stronger, rendering him invincible towards traditional ways of killing him, such as Christian crosses. Dracula sneaks into the Batcave, and attacks Batman. Batman attempts to use holy water and a cross to injure the vampire, but due to Zorba's machinations, they have no effect. Dracula throws Batman against a wall and then flees, leaving Batman knocked out. When the unconscious Batman is found by his butler, Turko (a character based on Alfred Pennyworth), he tends to the crime fighter's wounds and then calls for Batman's girlfriend and sidekick to aid in tracking down his attacker. After tracking down Zorba at his underground fortress, Ruben (a character based on the existing sidekick Robin) and the beautiful Marita manage to kill the evil doctor by turning the vampire against him. The vampire then is investigated by a recovering Batman within a cage in the Batcave, and the film ends with Batman lecturing Dracula about justice. ==Credited cast== *Jing Abalos as Batman/Bruce Mabuto *Ramon d'Salva as Dr. Zorba *Vivian Lorrain as Marita Banzon *Nort Nepomuceno as Alan \"Turko\" Turkentop *Dante Rivero as Dracula *Rolan Robles as Ruben ==See also== * Alyas Batman at Robin * James Batman * Batman & Dracula trilogy ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1967 films Category:1967 independent films Category:1960s superhero films Category:Philippine films Category:Lost Philippine films Category:Unofficial Batman films Category:Dracula films Category:1960s lost films Category:Mad scientist films Category:Resurrection in film",
