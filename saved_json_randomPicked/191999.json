 "text": "In mathematics, a tangent vector is a vector that is tangent to a curve or surface at a given point. Tangent vectors are described in the differential geometry of curves in the context of curves in Rn. More generally, tangent vectors are elements of a tangent space of a differentiable manifold. Tangent vectors can also be described in terms of germs. Formally, a tangent vector at the point x is a linear derivation of the algebra defined by the set of germs at x. == Motivation == Before proceeding to a general definition of the tangent vector, we discuss its use in calculus and its tensor properties. === Calculus === Let \\mathbf{r}(t) be a parametric smooth curve. The tangent vector is given by \\mathbf{r}'(t), where we have used a prime instead of the usual dot to indicate differentiation with respect to parameter .J. Stewart (2001) The unit tangent vector is given by \\mathbf{T}(t) = \\frac{\\mathbf{r}'(t)}{|\\mathbf{r}'(t)|}\\,. ==== Example ==== Given the curve \\mathbf{r}(t) = \\left\\\\{\\left(1+t^2, e^{2t}, \\cos{t}\\right) \\mid t\\in\\R\\right\\\\} in \\R^3, the unit tangent vector at t = 0 is given by \\mathbf{T}(0) = \\frac{\\mathbf{r}'(0)}{\\|\\mathbf{r}'(0)\\|} = \\left.\\frac{(2t, 2e^{2t}, -\\sin{t})}{\\sqrt{4t^2 + 4e^{4t} + \\sin^2{t}}}\\right|_{t=0} = (0,1,0)\\,. === Contravariance === If \\mathbf{r}(t) is given parametrically in the n-dimensional coordinate system (here we have used superscripts as an index instead of the usual subscript) by \\mathbf{r}(t) = (x^1(t), x^2(t), \\ldots, x^n(t)) or \\mathbf{r} = x^i = x^i(t), \\quad a\\leq t\\leq b\\,, then the tangent vector field \\mathbf{T} = T^i is given by T^i = \\frac{dx^i}{dt}\\,. Under a change of coordinates u^i = u^i(x^1, x^2, \\ldots, x^n), \\quad 1\\leq i\\leq n the tangent vector \\bar{\\mathbf{T}} = \\bar{T}^i in the -coordinate system is given by \\bar{T}^i = \\frac{du^i}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial u^i}{\\partial x^s} \\frac{dx^s}{dt} = T^s \\frac{\\partial u^i}{\\partial x^s} where we have used the Einstein summation convention. Therefore, a tangent vector of a smooth curve will transform as a contravariant tensor of order one under a change of coordinates.D. Kay (1988) == Definition == Let f: \\R^n \\to \\R be a differentiable function and let \\mathbf{v} be a vector in \\R^n. We define the directional derivative in the \\mathbf{v} direction at a point \\mathbf{x} \\in \\R^n by abla_\\mathbf{v} f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\left.\\frac{d}{dt} f(\\mathbf{x} + t\\mathbf{v})\\right|_{t=0} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}(\\mathbf{x})\\,. The tangent vector at the point \\mathbf{x} may then be definedA. Gray (1993) as \\mathbf{v}(f(\\mathbf{x})) \\equiv ( abla_\\mathbf{v}(f)) (\\mathbf{x})\\,. == Properties == Let f,g:\\mathbb{R}^n\\to\\mathbb{R} be differentiable functions, let \\mathbf{v},\\mathbf{w} be tangent vectors in \\mathbb{R}^n at \\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^n, and let a,b\\in\\mathbb{R}. Then #(a\\mathbf{v}+b\\mathbf{w})(f)=a\\mathbf{v}(f)+b\\mathbf{w}(f) #\\mathbf{v}(af+bg)=a\\mathbf{v}(f)+b\\mathbf{v}(g) #\\mathbf{v}(fg)=f(\\mathbf{x})\\mathbf{v}(g)+g(\\mathbf{x})\\mathbf{v}(f)\\,. ==Tangent vector on manifolds== Let M be a differentiable manifold and let A(M) be the algebra of real-valued differentiable functions on M. Then the tangent vector to M at a point x in the manifold is given by the derivation D_v:A(M)\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R} which shall be linear -- i.e., for any f,g\\in A(M) and a,b\\in\\mathbb{R} we have :D_v(af+bg)=aD_v(f)+bD_v(g)\\,. Note that the derivation will by definition have the Leibniz property :D_v(f\\cdot g)(x)=D_v(f)(x)\\cdot g(x)+f(x)\\cdot D_v(g)(x)\\,. == See also == * == References == == Bibliography == * . * . * .
