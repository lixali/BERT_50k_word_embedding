It was the town's early newspaper editor, W. E. Gibson, who suggested its current name for the city of Corinth in Greece that also served as a crossroads. Corinth's location at the junction of two railroads made it strategically important to the Confederacy during the American Civil War. Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard retreated to Corinth after the Battle of Shiloh (April 1862), pursued by Union Major General Henry W. Halleck. General Beauregard abandoned the town on May 29 when General Halleck approached, letting it fall into the Union's hands. Since Halleck had approached so cautiously, digging entrenchments at every stop for over a month, this action has been known as the Siege of Corinth. The Union sent Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans to Corinth as well and concentrated its forces in the city. The Second Battle of Corinth took place on October 3−4, 1862, when Confederate Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn attempted to retake the city. thumb|Inside the Civil War Interpretive Center in Corinth. ===Locales on the National Register of Historic Places=== * Battery Williams (also known as Fort Williams) * Siege and Battle of Corinth Sites * Coliseum Theatre- built in the early 20th century in the Colonial Revival style * Corinth National Cemetery * Downtown Corinth Historic District * Dr. Joseph M.
