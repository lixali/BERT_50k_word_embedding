There are some exceptions, notably some Islamic flags inscribed in Arabic, which is written from right to left; for these the obverse is defined as the side with the hoist to the observer's right. == See also == * Vexillological symbol ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Vexillology Vexillology Category:Vexillology",
