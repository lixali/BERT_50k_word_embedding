The villages of Niantic and Flanders are located in the town. ==Geography== left|thumb|500x500px|View of the Rocky Neck State Park jetty, beach and the Giants Neck area shoreline in the Niantic section of East Lyme, Connecticut.East Lyme is located in southern New London County, west of Waterford and Montville, east of Lyme and Old Lyme, and south of Salem. Long Island Sound is to the south. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 19%, is water. ===Villages=== The town consists primarily of two villages, Flanders and Niantic. It is common for the town of East Lyme to be erroneously called \"Niantic\", due to this side of town being the \"beach\" side which is popular with tourists and visitors in the summer months. Niantic's population doubles in the summer months for the beach season, and it has a much higher density than the more sparsely populated Flanders side of town, which is known for its apple orchards, the town's high school, and the forest. ====Niantic==== thumb|300px|The Morton House Hotel in the village of Niantic has been in continuous operation for more than 100 years. The village of Niantic gets its name from the Niantic or Nehantic people, whose ranging grounds once extended from Wecapaug Brook, in what is now Rhode Island, to the Connecticut River. Shortly before the first settlers arrived, the Pequots had invaded Nehantic territory and annexed about half of the land claimed by the tribe. According to local historian Olive Tubbs Chendali: > It was the construction of the railroad in 1851 that lured people to the > shoreline which up to this time had been known - not as Niantic - but as > \"The Bank\". Long before this time, however, as evidenced by The Diary of > Joshua Hempstead - 1711 - 1758 it was known as \"Nahantick\" \"Nyantick\" or > \"Nehantic\", the home territory of the Nehantic Indians. Sportfishing and marinas dominate the village's industry along with summer tourism and restaurant trade. Strong regional businesses include seafood restaurants and hotels/motels serving the town's beaches and the casinos at Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun. Rocky Neck State Park features camping, swimming and picnic areas along with numerous marinas and sportfishing companies. The Niantic Bay Boardwalk is a one-mile (1.6 km) long walkway that runs parallel to Amtrakâ€™s shoreline railroad tracks and spans Niantic Bay from the Niantic River inlet to Hole-in-the-Wall municipal beach. It first opened to the public in 2005, but was closed from about 2011 due to a combination of Amtrak building a new railroad bridge across the Niantic River, which required a re- positioning of the approach tracks, and damage caused by Hurricane Irene in October 2011. The boardwalk fully re-opened to the public in March 2016. The Children's Museum of Southeastern Connecticut is located in East Lyme's original public library on Main Street. The museum is aimed primarily at children ages infant to ten years old. The current public library is located on Society Road, away from Niantic. The village of Niantic includes the beach communities of Attawan Beach, Black Point, Crescent Beach, Giants Neck Beach, Giants Neck Heights, Oak Grove Beach, Old Black Point, Pine Grove, and Saunder's Point. ====Flanders==== The village of Flanders, originally a farming area along the Old Post Road, gets its name from the development of woolen mills similar to that in Flanders, Belgium. The heart of the village is located at Flanders Four Corners at the intersection of Chesterfield Road (Route 161) and Boston Post Road (Route 1). This area is the site of many small stores and businesses, as well as East Lyme High School, Flanders Elementary School, and the Board of Education. Flanders was the original center of East Lyme society with dozens of 18th century homes, shops and public inns situated along the Boston Post Road until the early 1800s. It lost its pre-eminence as Niantic began to flourish, first with the growth of commercial fishing and then with the construction of the Shore Line Railway. Many of the original Flanders homes have been lost as a result of the construction of Interstate 95 in the 1950s and subsequent commercial construction at the Four Corners area. For example, the old Caulkins Tavern stood at the site of the current CVS and was a well-traveled and documented stopping place in the 18th century from none other than Sarah Kemble Knight in her diary, as well as General George Washington, who stopped here with thousands of troops in 1776. Some homes remain closer to the Waterford line at the site of the old Beckwith Shipyard at the head of the Niantic River. ====Other minor communities==== Golden Spur is a community located at the head of the Niantic River, which earned it its other name, \"Head of the River\". In the eighteenth century it was the site of the Beckwith shipyard. By the turn of the 20th century it was the site of an amusement park accessible by trolley run by the East Lyme Street Railway. The park operated until 1924. ===Topography=== The topography of East Lyme consists of rolling hills and lush valleys rounded by glaciers during the last Ice Age. Hills rise to elevations of above sea level in the eastern and central areas of the town. The highest point in town is Mount Pisgah with an elevation of located in Nehantic State Forest in the northwest corner of the town.U.S. Geological Survey 7.5-minute topographic map series East Lyme is especially scenic in the summer when the trees are in bloom. On its east and southern sides, the town abuts tidewater. The tidal Niantic River on the east feeds Niantic Bay, an arm of Long Island Sound, which forms the southern edge of the town. ==Demographics== As of the census of 2000, there were 18,118 people, 6,308 households, and 4,535 families residing in the town.

This building is located in the southwestern section of East Lyme, adjacent to Rocky Neck State Park, at the intersection of Connecticut Route 156 and Giants Neck Road. Co-located on this site is the one-room Little Boston Schoolhouse, which was relocated to its current location from across Route 156. The town features six homes from 1699 or earlier, and the Old Stone Church Burial Ground from 1719 located off Society and Riverview roads. The area occupied by the town was originally inhabited by the Nehantic people, who maintained villages in the present-day Indian Woods section as well as on Black Point, in the McCook's Beach area and near the Niantic River. The tribe allied itself with the colonists in the 1636 war against the Pequot people. The Nehantic would die out in the mid-19th century. The 1750s Ezra Stiles map shows the Nehantic village in what is now Indian Woods as consisting of \"12 or 13 huts\". East Lyme, then a part of Lyme, had several taverns which offered stopping places for travelers such as Sarah Kemble Knight. These included Calkins Tavern on what is now Boston Post Road, Royce's Tavern, and Taber Tavern near present-day I-95. At least 45 Revolutionary War veterans are buried within the borders of East Lyme, and countless more veterans from East Lyme found resting places in upstate New York, New Hampshire and Ohio. Moses Warren, along with General Samuel Holden Parsons originally of Lyme and Moses Cleaveland, set out to survey the Ohio Territory in the latter part of the 1790s and has Warren County, Ohio named after him. ===Notable locations=== *Morton Freeman Plant Hunting Lodge - built in 1908, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. *Samuel Smith House - built in 1685, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. *Smith-Harris House - built in 1845, this Greek Revival home was added as the \"Thomas Avery House\" to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. *Thomas Lee House - built circa 1664, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.
