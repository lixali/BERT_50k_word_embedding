The municipality of Tholen takes its name from the town of Tholen, which is the largest population center in the municipality. The municipality consists of two peninsulas, formerly islands, the larger one on the south also called Tholen, the smaller one on the north called Sint Philipsland. The two are separated by the former strait, now bay, of Krabbenkreek. The municipality is bordered on the east by the Eendracht, once a Scheldt branch but now part of the Scheldt-Rhine Canal, crossed by three road bridges, by the Oosterschelde estuary to the south, the straits of Keeten-Mastgat to the west and the Krammer strait to the north. The town has a small historical center partly surrounded by a \"gracht\" and partly bordered by a harbour for fishing boats and yachts. == Population centers == 225px|thumb|right|Dutch Topographic map of Tholen, June 2015 On the island Sint Philipsland there are three villages: On the island Tholen there are seven population centers: == Twin town == Tholen is twinned with: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- valign=\"top\" | * Iława, Poland |} == Notable people == * Ghiselin Danckerts (ca.1510 in Tholen – 1567) a Dutch composer, singer and music theorist * Sir Cornelius Vermuyden 1595 in Sint-Maartensdijk – 1677) a Dutch engineer who introduced Dutch land reclamation methods to England * Maertin Cornelissen Geldersman, who bought a farm named Rosevelt (\"rose field\") in Tholen, which gave its name to his descendants Theodore Roosevelt, Eleanore Roosevelt, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. * Chris Lanooy (1881 in Sint-Annaland - 1948) a Dutch potter, designer, ceramist, painter, draftsman and sculptor, and he produced stained-glass art * Leen Quist (1942 in Sint Philipsland – 2014) a Dutch ceramist, liked a perfect finish and geometric (blue) lines * Elly Plooij-van Gorsel (born 1947 in Tholen) a Member of the European Parliament === Sport === * Keetie van Oosten-Hage (born 1949 in Sint- Maartensdijk) a Dutch former cyclist * Deborah Gravenstijn (born 1974 in Tholen) a Dutch judoka and Captain in the Royal Netherlands Air Force; bronze medallist at the 2004 Summer Olympics and silver medallist 2008 Summer Olympics ==Images== File:Gergem tholen 1.jpg|Reformed Congregation Tholen File:tholen 006.jpg|Former city hall File:Tholen - Korenmolen - De Hoop.jpg|Mill \"de Hoop\" File:tholen 007.jpg|Great Church File:Tholen 012.jpg|Venkelstreet File:Tholen 014.jpg|Harbour File:Krabbenkreek- Zeeland-2020-Luka-Peternel.jpg|Aerial view of Krabbenkreek ==References== == External links == * * Category:Municipalities of Zeeland Category:Populated places in Zeeland Category:Landforms of Zeeland Category:Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta",
