 "text": "Clarence LeRoy \"Lee\" Van Cleef Jr. (January 9, 1925 – December 16, 1989) was an American actor best known for his roles in Spaghetti Westerns such as For a Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. In his film debut, High Noon, he was asked to have his nose altered to play a sympathetic character. However, after declining this request he was relegated to a non-speaking outlaw cast role. Van Cleef was often typecast as a minor villain for the majority of his career, proposedly due to his physical features. After suffering serious injuries in a car crash, Van Cleef's acting career to started to decline. However, Sergio Leone offered him a major role in For a Few Dollars More. The film proved to be a huge hit and cited him as a box- office draw, largely in Europe. == Early life == Lee Van Cleef was born on January 9, 1925, in Somerville, New Jersey, to Marion Lavinia Van Fleet and Clarence LeRoy Van Cleef. Lee graduated high school early at the age of 17 from Somerville High School New JerseyHatala, Greg. \"Glimpse of History: 'Being born with a pair of beady eyes was the best thing that ever happened to me' – Lee Van Cleef\", The Star-Ledger, August 26, 2013. Accessed November 4, 2017. \"Looking at this photo of Clarence Leroy Van Cleef Jr. from the 1943 Somerville High School yearbook, it's hard to imagine him acquiring the sobriquet 'ugly.' Yet he was tagged just that 23 years later when he starred with Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach in Sergio Leone's classic western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.\" in order to enlist in the United States Navy in September 1942. == Military service == After completing his military training, Van Cleef was assigned to a submarine chaser and then to a minesweeper called the , on which he worked as a sonarman. The ship initially patrolled the Caribbean, then moved to the Mediterranean, participating in the landings in southern France. In January 1945, Incredible moved to the Black Sea, and performed sweeping duties out of the Soviet Navy base at Sevastopol, Crimea. Afterwards, the ship performed air-sea rescue patrols in the Black Sea before returning to Palermo, Sicily. By the time of his discharge in March 1946, he had achieved the rank of Sonarman First Class (SO1) and had earned his mine sweeper patch. He also had been awarded the Bronze Star and the Good Conduct Medal. By virtue of his deployments, Van Cleef also qualified for the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, the American Campaign Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal. He was discharged from the Navy in 1946. {| |- |80px|border Bronze Star |- |border|80px Good Conduct Medal |- |80px European–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal |- |80px|Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal ribbon Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal |- |80px|border|alt=American Campaign Medal ribbon American Campaign Medal |- |80px|Ribbon for World War II Victory Medal World War II Victory Medal | | |} == Early acting career == After leaving the Navy, Van Cleef received his first acting role as a reader for the play Our Town at the Little Theater Group in Clinton, New Jersey. From there, he continued to meet with the group and audition for parts. The next biggest part was that of the boxer, Joe Pendleton, in the play Heaven Can Wait. During this time, he was observed by visiting talent scouts, who were impressed by Van Cleef's stage presence and delivery. One of these scouts later took him to New York City talent agent Maynard Morris of the MCA agency, who then sent him to the Alvin Theater for an audition. The play was Mister Roberts. Van Cleef's screen debut came in High Noon. During a performance of Mister Roberts in Los Angeles, he was noticed by film producer Stanley Kramer, who offered Van Cleef a role in his upcoming film. Kramer originally wanted Van Cleef for the role of the deputy Harvey Pell, but as he wanted Van Cleef to have his \"distinctive nose\" fixed, Van Cleef declined the role in favor of the part of the silent gunslinger Jack Colby. He was then cast mostly in villainous roles, due to his sharp cheeks and chin, piercing eyes, and hawk-like nose, from the part of Tony Romano in Kansas City Confidential (1952),Kansas City Confidential culminating 14 years later in Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966).The Good, the Bad and the Ugly thumb|Van Cleef in Stories of the Century (1954) Aside from Westerns and the science fiction films, three of his early major roles were in noir films, Kansas City Confidential (1952), Vice Squad (1953) and The Big Combo (1955). Van Cleef appeared six times between 1951 and 1955 on the children's syndicated Western series The Adventures of Kit Carson, starring Bill Williams. He was cast three times, including the role of Rocky Hatch in the episode \"Greed Rides the Range\" (1952), of another syndicated Western series, The Range Rider. In 1952, he was cast in the episode \"Formula for Fear\" of the Western aviation series Sky King. He appeared in episode 82 of the TV series The Lone Ranger in 1952. In 1954, Van Cleef appeared as Jesse James in the syndicated series Stories of the Century. In 1955, he was cast twice on another syndicated Western series, Annie Oakley. That same year, he guest-starred on the CBS Western series, Brave Eagle. In 1955, he played one of the two villains in an episode of The Adventures of Champion the Wonder Horse. In 1958, he was cast as Ed Murdock, a rodeo performer trying to reclaim the title in the event at Madison Square Garden in New York City, on Richard Diamond, Private Detective.

He also appeared in an episode of the ABC/Warner Brothers Western series The Alaskans. Van Cleef guest-starred on the CBS Western series Have Gun – Will Travel, on the ABC/Warner Bros. series Colt .45, on the NBC Western series Cimarron City and Laramie, and on Rod Cameron's syndicated crime dramas City Detective and State Trooper. He guest-starred in an episode of John Bromfield's syndicated crime drama Sheriff of Cochise. Van Cleef starred as minor villains and henchmen in various Westerns, including The Tin Star and Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. His film characters died in many of his Westerns and gangster portrayals. In 1960, he appeared as a villainous swindler in the Bonanza episode, \"The Bloodline\" (December 31, 1960) and also made an appearance on Gunsmoke. In 1961, he played a role on episode 7 (\"The Grave\") of the third season of The Twilight Zone. He played a villainous henchman of Lee Marvin's title character in the 1962 John Ford movie The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. In 1963, he appeared on Perry Mason (episode: \"The Case of the Golden Oranges\"). That same year, he appeared in \"The Day of the Misfits\" on The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters. == Stardom == In 1965, Sergio Leone cast Van Cleef, whose career had yet to take off, as a main protagonist alongside Clint Eastwood in For a Few Dollars More. Leone then chose Van Cleef to appear again with Eastwood, this time as the primary antagonist, Angel Eyes, in the now seminal Western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966). With his roles in Leone's films, Van Cleef became a major star of Spaghetti Westerns, playing central, and often surprisingly heroic, roles in films such as The Big Gundown (1966), Death Rides a Horse (1967), Day of Anger (1967), and The Grand Duel (1972). He played the title role in Sabata (1969) and Return of Sabata (1971), and co-starred with Jim Brown in an Italian-American co-production, Take a Hard Ride (1975). In his final two westerns he co-starred with Leif Garrett in God's Gun (1976) and Kid Vengeance (1977), both of which were filmed mainly in Israel. Van Cleef later had a supporting role in John Carpenter's cult film Escape from New York (1981). He slipped out of the limelight in his later years. In 1984, he was cast as a ninja master in the NBC adventure series The Master, but it was canceled after thirteen episodes. In all, Van Cleef is credited with 90 movie roles and 109 television appearances over a 38-year span. == Personal life == Van Cleef was married three times. His first marriage was to Patsy Ruth Kahle, in 1943. They had three children, Alan, Deborah and David, and divorced in 1958. His second marriage was to Joan Marjorie Drane, from 1960 to 1974. His final marriage was to Barbara Havelone in 1976, who survived him. He lost the last joint of the middle finger of his right hand while building a playhouse for his daughter. In 1958, a severe car crash nearly cost Van Cleef his life and career. A resulting knee injury made his physicians think that he would never ride a horse again. This injury plagued Van Cleef for the rest of his life and caused him great pain. His recovery was long and difficult and halted his acting for a time. He then began a business in interior decoration with second wife Joan, as well as pursuing his talent for painting, primarily of sea and landscapes. ==Death== thumb|upright=0.9|Van Cleef's grave at Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills Despite suffering from heart disease from the late 1970s and having a pacemaker installed in the early 1980s, Van Cleef continued to work in films until his death on December 16, 1989, at age 64. He collapsed in his home in Oxnard, California, from a heart attack. Throat cancer was listed as a secondary cause of death. He was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery, Hollywood Hills, California, with an inscription on his grave marker referring to his many acting performances as a villain: \"BEST OF THE BAD\". == Filmography == === Film === {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=70% !width=35px| Year !width=235px| Title !Role !Director !Notes |- |rowspan=3|1952 |High Noon |Jack Colby |Fred Zinnemann |(no-dialog role) with Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly |- |Untamed Frontier |Dave Chittun |Hugo Fregonese |with Joseph Cotten and Shelley Winters |- |Kansas City Confidential |Tony Romano |Phil Karlson |with John Payne and Coleen Gray |- |rowspan=9|1953 |The Lawless Breed |Dirk Hanley |Raoul Walsh |with Rock Hudson |- |The Bandits of Corsica |Nerva |Ray Nazarro | |- |White Lightning |Brutus Allen |Edward Bernds | |- |The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms |Corporal Stone |Eugène Lourié | |- |Arena |\"Smitty\" Smith |Richard Fleischer | |- |Vice Squad |Pete Monte |Arnold Laven |with Edward G.
