It is a nationally recognized archeological site.Arizona Travel and Tours delange.org The name Casa Malpais means \"House built from Malapai\", which describes the type volcanic vesicular basalt from which the ancient village was constructed. It is thought that the name was given to the village by early Basque sheepherders. The Springerville volcanic field contains over 400 volcanoes within a radius of Springerville, making it the third largest volcanic field in the continental United States. The first visit to Casa Malpais by a professional anthropologist was in 1883, when Frank Cushing, living at Zuni, visited a site at \"El Valle Redondo on the Colorado Chiquito\", and was impressed by what he termed \"the fissure type pueblo\" he found there. In his journal he sketched dry masonry, bridging fissures, upon which the pueblo is constructed. Unique and unusual features characterize the site. The Great Kiva, painstakingly constructed of volcanic rock, is the centerpiece. A steep basalt staircase set into a crevice of the high red cliff wall leads to the top of the mesa. Both the Hopi and Zuni people still consider Casa Malpais a sacred ancestral place. The town contains one of the twelve Madonna of the Trail monuments created by sculptor August Leimbach. The town is close to the Apache–Sitgreaves National Forests, which run along the Mogollon Rim. It is also close to the Sunrise Ski Resort. The El Rio opened in 1915, making it the oldest movie theater in Arizona. It was originally called the Apache Theater, until it was changed in 1937 to the El Rio. ==Notable people== * Mark Gastineau, former football player for the New York Jets * Alex Madrid, baseball player for the Milwaukee Brewers and Philadelphia Phillies * Billie Maxwell, credited with being the first female singer to record country musichttp://www.amoeba.com/blog/2009/03/eric-s-blog/billie-maxwell-the-cow- girl-singer.html * Jerry D.
