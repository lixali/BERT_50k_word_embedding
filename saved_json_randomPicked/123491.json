As of the 2010 census, the population was 1,013. ==History== Meriwether Lewis passed through here on his return to St. Louis in 1806, following the famous \"River of the Road to the Buffalo\" created by Native Americans centuries before. Gold discoveries in the mid-1860s brought miners to a number of camps in the area, and Lincoln was eventually created when nearby Lincoln Gulch was abandoned in favor of the town's present location.

Nearby wilderness areas continue to attract visitors and residents. The Lincoln Community Hall (1918) and the Hotel Lincoln (1914) are listed on the National Register of Historical Places. ===\"Unabomber\" arrest=== On April 3, 1996, federal officers arrested Ted Kaczynski at his remote cabin south of Lincoln along Twin Gulch Drive, under suspicion of being the \"Unabomber\", a domestic terrorist who placed pressure-sensitive bombs inside mailed packages.Hardy, Quentin; Carley, William M.; Davidson, Joe. \"Unabomber suspect held in Montana\".
