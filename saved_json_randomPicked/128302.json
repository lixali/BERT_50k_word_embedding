It is one of the smallest municipalities of Sweden, but the most affluent. Its seat is located in Djursholm and it is located within Stockholm urban area. The \"old\" rural municipality Danderyd was split up during the early 20th century, when Djursholm and Stocksund broke away in 1901 and 1910 respectively. Since 1971 Danderyd Municipality is reunified in approximately the old boundaries. The population in 2019 was 32,857. The four districts making up Danderyd are: Danderyd, Djursholm, Stocksund and Enebyberg. ==Demographics== ===Income and Education=== The population in Danderyd Municipality is among the most affluent in the country, having the highest median income per capita. One of the reasons for this is the high price on real estate, which in turn is partially due to a restrictive policy on new developments by the municipality council. The high income of the population has enabled the municipality to maintain a relatively low rate of taxation, but a government redistribution scheme intended to transfer money from socioeconomically advantaged municipalities to those less well-off along with financial mismanagement has caused tax rises and expenditure reductions in recent years. Danderyd Municipality also has the highest share (57.0%) of highly educated persons (Statistics Sweden definition: persons with post-secondary education that is three years or longer) in the country. ===Residents with a foreign background === On 31 December 2017 the number of people with a foreign background (persons born outside of Sweden or with two parents born outside of Sweden) was 6,402, or 19.47% of the population (32,888 on 31 December 2017). On 31 December 2002 the number of residents with a foreign background was (per the same definition) 4,512, or 15.16% (29,755 on 31 December 2002).Antal personer efter region, utländsk/svensk bakgrund och år (Read 4 januari 2019) On 31 December 2017 there were 32,888 residents in Danderyd, of which 5,394 people (16.40%) were born in a country other than Sweden, divided by country in the table below. Nordic countries as well as the 12 most common countries of birth outside of Sweden for Swedish residents have been included, with other countries of birth grouped together by continent by Statistics Sweden.Statistiska centralbyrån: Utrikes födda efter län, kommun och födelseland 31 december 2017 (XLS-fil) Läst 4 januari 2019 {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" ! colspan=3| Country of birth |- | colspan=3 style=\"text-align:center;\" | 31 December 2017 |- | 1 || || align=right | |- | 2 || : Other countries || align=right | |- | 3 || Asia: Other countries || align=right | |- | 4 || North America || align=right | |- | 5 || || align=right | |- | 6 || || align=right | |- | 7 || || align=right | |- | 8 || South America || align=right | |- | 9 || outside of the EU: other countries || align=right | |- | 10 || || align=right | |- | 11 || Africa: Other countries || align=right | |- | 12 || || align=right | |- | 13 || || align=right | |- | 14 || || align=right | |- | 15 || || align=right | |- | 16 || || align=right | |- | 17 || || align=right | |- | 18 || || align=right | |- | 19 || Oceania || align=right | |- | 20 || || align=right | |- | 21 || / SFR Yugoslavia/|| align=right | |- | 22 || || align=right | |- | 23 || || align=right | |- | 24 || || align=right | |- | 25 || || align=right | |- | 26 || Unknown country of birth || align=right | |} ==Roads== The European route E18 stretches through the municipality, from the road bridge over the Stocksundet sea strait, north towards Norrtälje Municipality. ==Public transport== Danderyd is served by the Stockholm public transport system through SL.
