The park contains two volcanically- formed lakes, Lake Barrine and Lake Eacham (Yidyam). Both lakes have walking trails around the lake; boat tours are also given at Lake Barrine. One of the recognizable features of the park are giant bull kauri pine trees (Agathis australis). The average elevation of the terrain is 729 meters. == History == In 1934, the Queensland Government created Lake Barrine National Park and Lake Eacham National Park. In 1988, UNESCO declared the Wet Tropics of Queensland a World Heritage Site with 14 areas protected, one of which was at Lake Barrine and at Lake Eacham. In 1994, the Queensland Government merged Lake Barrine National Park and Lake Eacham National Park to form Crater Lakes National Park.
