He also produced stage productions for a few years and gave college lectures.Online Literature ==Biography== Morley was born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. His father, Frank Morley, was a mathematics professor at Haverford College; his mother, Lilian Janet Bird, was a violinist who provided Christopher with much of his later love for literature and poetry.http://www.online-literature.com/morley/ Online Literature page for Christopher Morley, accessed November 22, 2009 In 1900, the family moved to Baltimore, Maryland. In 1906 Christopher entered Haverford College, graduating in 1910 as valedictorian. He then went to New College, Oxford, for three years on a Rhodes scholarship, studying modern history.Baltimore Literary Heritage Project In 1913 Morley completed his Oxford studies and moved to New York City, New York. On June 14, 1914, he married Helen Booth Fairchild, with whom he would have four children, including Louise Morley Cochrane. They first lived in Hempstead, and then in Queens Village. They then moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and in 1920 they made their final move, to a house they called \"Green Escape\" in Roslyn Estates, New York. They remained there for the rest of his life. In 1936 he built a cabin at the rear of the property (The Knothole), which he maintained as his writing study from then on. In 1951 Morley suffered a series of strokes, which greatly reduced his voluminous literary output. He died on March 28, 1957, and was buried in the Roslyn Cemetery in Nassau County, New York. After his death, two New York newspapers published his last message to his friends: ==Career== Morley began writing while still in college. He edited The Haverfordian and contributed articles to that college publication. He provided scripts for and acted in the college's drama program. He played on the cricket and soccer teams. In Oxford a volume of his poems, The Eighth Sin (1912), was published. After graduating from Oxford, Morley began his literary career at Doubleday, working as publicist and publisher's reader. In 1917 he got his start as an editor for Ladies' Home Journal (1917–1918), then as a newspaper reporter and newspaper columnist in Philadelphia for the Philadelphia Evening Public Ledger. Morley's first novel, Parnassus on Wheels, appeared in 1917. The protagonist, traveling bookseller Roger Mifflin, appeared again in his second novel, The Haunted Bookshop in 1919. In 1920 Morley returned to New York City to write a column (The Bowling Green) for the New York Evening Post.Living the Literary Life - Mass Media, New York, New York Times - Newsday.com In 1922, a candid interview was seen nationwide in newspapers, part of a series called Humor's Sober Side: How Humorists Get That Way. Other humorists interviewed in the same series included Will Rogers, Dorothy Parker, Don Marquis, Roy K. Moulton, Tom Sims, Tom Daly, and Ring Lardner.Van de Grift, Josephine. (October 19, 1922). \"Humor's sober side: Being an interview with Christopher Morley, another of a series on how humorists get that way\", Bisbee Daily Review, p. 4. He was one of the founders and a longtime contributing editor of the Saturday Review of Literature. A highly gregarious man, he was the mainstay of what he dubbed the \"Three Hours for Lunch Club\". Out of enthusiasm for the Sherlock Holmes stories, he helped found the Baker Street Irregulars and wrote the introduction to the standard omnibus edition of The Complete Sherlock Holmes. \"Kit\" wrote prefaces, introductions, or forewords for over fifty books. Many of these were posthumously collected as \"Prefaces without Books.\".\"Prefaces without Books,\" copyright 1970 by the Humanities Research Center, as noted in \"The Standard Doyle Company: Christopher Morley on Sherlock Holmes,\" edited by Steven Rothman, copyright 1990 by the Estate of Christopher Morley, page 88. A lion of literature, Morley was able in these essays to analyze subtleties within the Sherlock Holmes stories, for example, examining the influences of Doyle's youthful love of Robert Louis Stevenson's writings upon the Holmes stories. But Morley goes much farther, analyzing the Holmes stories as if they are historical artifacts. For examples, he peruses maps of the British sea coast to try to determine the location of Holmes' retirement bee-keeping, he tries to develop a floor plan for Holmes' Baker Street residence, and he conjectures upon Watson's love-life. Morley explained \"Is it trivial or absurd to apply to these imaginary characters the same close attention which is the principle of the stories themselves?\" and \"There is a special and superior pleasure in reading anything so much more carefully than its author ever did.\"\"Memorandum and Introduction to \"Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson: A Textbook of Friendship,\" Christopher Morley editor, copyright 1944 by Harcourt Brace, and later published in \"The Standard Doyle Company: Christopher Morley on Sherlock Holmes,\" edited by Steven Rothman, copyright 1990 by the Estate of Christopher Morley, pages 115, 116. He also wrote an introduction to the standard omnibus edition of The Complete Works of Shakespeare in 1936, although Morley called it an \"Introduction to Yourself as a Reader of Shakespeare\".Wallach, Mark I., Bracker, Jon. \"Christopher Morley\". Twayne Publishers, 1976. 112. That year, he was appointed to revise and enlarge Bartlett's Familiar Quotations (11th edition in 1937 and 12th edition in 1948). He was one of the first judges for the Book of the Month Club, serving in that position until the early 1950s. Author of more than 100 novels, books of essays, and volumes of poetry, Morley is probably best known for his 1939 novel Kitty Foyle, which was made into an Academy Award-winning movie. Another well-known work is Thunder on the Left (1925). From 1928 to 1930, Morley and set designer Cleon Throckmorton co-produced theater productions (dramas) at two theaters they purchased and renovated in Hoboken, New Jersey,http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1929-04-20#folio=016 which they had \"deemed the last seacoast in Bohemia\".\"The Theatre: In Hoboken\". Time. March 25, 1929.\"Theatre: New Play in Hoboken\". Time. October 7, 1929. For most of his life, he lived in Roslyn Estates, Nassau County, Long Island, commuting to the city on the Long Island Rail Road, about which he wrote affectionately. In 1961, the 98-acre (40-hectare) Christopher Morley Park on Searingtown Road in Nassau County was named in his honor. This park preserves as a publicly available point of interest his studio, the \"Knothole\" (which was moved to the site after his death), along with his furniture and bookcases. ==Notable works== *Parnassus on Wheels (novel, 1917) *Shandygaff (travel and literary essays, short stories 1918) *The Haunted Bookshop (novel, 1919) *The Rocking Horse (poetry, 1919) *Pipefuls (collection of humorous essays, 1920) *Kathleen (novel, 1920) *Plum Pudding, of divers Ingredients, Discreetly Blended & Seasoned (collection of humorous essays, 1921, illustrated by Walter Jack Duncan) *Where the Blue Begins (satirical novel, 1922) *The Powder of Sympathy (collection of humorous essays, 1923, illustrated by Walter Jack Duncan) *Religio Journalistici (1924) *Thunder on the Left (novel, 1925) *The Romany Stain (Short stories, 1926) * I know a Secret (Novel for children, 1927) *Essays by Christopher Morley (collection of essays, 1928) *Off the Deep End (collection of essays, 1928, illustrated by John Alan Maxwell) *Seacoast of Bohemia (\"history of four infatuated adventurers, Morley, Cleon Throckmorton, Conrad Milliken and Harry Wagstaff Gribble, who rediscovered the Old Rialto Theatre in Hoboken, and refurnished it\", 1929, illustrated by John Alan Maxwell) *Born in a Beer Garden, or She Troupes to Conquer (with Cleon Throckmorton and Ogden Nash, 1930) *John Mistletoe (autobiographical novel, 1931) *Swiss Family Manhattan (novel, 1932) *Ex Libris Carissimis (non-fiction writing based on lectures he presented at University of Pennsylvania, 1932) *Shakespeare and Hawaii (non-fiction writing based on lectures he presented at University of Hawaii, 1933) *Human Being (novel, Doubleday, Doran & Co., Garden City NY, 1934)cover page of the novel *Ex Libris (1936) *The Trojan Horse (novel, 1937) Rewritten as a play and produced 1940\"'The Trojan Horse'\", Life, November 25, 1940, p. 56 *Kitty Foyle (novel, 1939) *Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson: A Textbook of Friendship (analysis of Arthur Conan Doyle's writings, 1944) *The Old Mandarin (book of poetry, 1947) *The Man Who Made Friends with Himself (his last novel, 1949) *On Vimy Ridge (poetry, 1947) ==Literary connections== *Morley was a close friend of Don Marquis, author of the Archy and Mehitabel stories featuring the antics and commentary of a New York cockroach and a cat.
