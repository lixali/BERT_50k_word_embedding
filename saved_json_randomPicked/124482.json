The town also includes the village of Alton Bay, a long-time resort located beside Lake Winnipesaukee. ==History== Originally called \"New Durham Gore\"Hayward's New England Gazetteer (1839) because of rocky upland areas, or \"gores\", the town was settled in 1770, mainly by farmers because the highland areas provided less frost. Merchants then filled the lowlands. Early Alton history recounts stories of the merchants trying to convince the farmers to incorporate. They would succeed on 15 January 1796,Statistics and Gazetteer of New-Hampshire (1875) when the community was named after Alton, a small market town in Hampshire, England. Alton was part of Strafford County until Belknap County was erected on 22 December 1840.Statistics and Gazetteer of New- Hampshire (1875) By 1840, the village of Alton existed at the town's center. In 1847, the Cochecho Railroad began bringing passengers and freight to Alton Village and Alton Bay. By 1859, the town had two gristmills, seven sawmills, and five shoe factories. But the most famous business was the Rockwell Clough Company, established by William Rockwell Clough, inventor of the corkscrew. By 1903, his company was producing 30 million corkscrews worldwide.A. Chester Clark, \"The Rockwell Clough Company;\" The Granite State Monthly, Volume 41, 1909 Since the mid-19th century, however, tourism has been the principal business. In 1863, an Adventist group held a camp meeting at Alton Bay, which was the terminus of the Dover and Winnipiseogee Railroad. That was incorporated as the Alton Bay Camp Meeting Association (now known as Alton Bay Christian Conference Center) in 1876. In 1872, the Boston & Maine Railroad launched at Alton Bay the steamer Mount Washington, the first side-wheeler and largest vessel on Lake Winnipesaukee. When destroyed by fire in 1939, a replacement ship was found, also christened Mount Washington. Today, it continues to carry summer tourists between stops on the lake.
