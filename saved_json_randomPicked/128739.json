Its seat is located in the town of Svenljunga. The present municipality was created in 1971 when five municipal units (or parts thereof) were amalgamated. The number of original entities (as of 1863) is 14. Through the municipality the river Ätran flows in a scenic valley. It flows through the town of Svenljunga, where an old bridge crosses it. This was the hometown of the great-great-great grandfather of Emma Stone, American actress. In the 18th-century, the village of Mårdaklev in Svenljunga Municipality was the home of a trio of sibling textile artists: Sven Erlandsson, Katarina Erlandsdotter and Lisa Erlandsdotter. ==References== ==External links== * *Svenljunga Municipality - Official site Category:Municipalities of Västra Götaland County Category:South Älvsborg",
