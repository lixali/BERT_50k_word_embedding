 "text": "Midnite Vultures is the seventh studio album by American musician Beck, released on November 23, 1999 by DGC Records. While similar to most of Beck's previous albums in its exploration of widely varying styles, it did not achieve the same blockbuster success as his breakthrough album Odelay, but was still critically acclaimed and commercially successful. == Recording == Working titles for the album included Zatyricon (the name of a song released in 2000 as a B-side on the \"Nicotine & Gravy\" single and later included on the Beck EP) and I Can Smell the V.D. in the Club Tonight (a line from \"Milk & Honey\"). == Influences == Several songs were directly inspired by other songs: \"Get Real Paid\" features a spiraling sequencer motif reminiscent of Kraftwerk's \"Home Computer\"; a synth breakdown in \"Milk & Honey\" echoes a similar riff in Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's \"The Message\"; \"Beautiful Way\" came about after listening to The Velvet Underground's \"Countess from Hong Kong\"; and \"Debra\" was inspired by both Prince's song \"Adore\" and the David Bowie song \"Win\". == Release == Midnite Vultures reached number 34 in the US, where it went gold, and also hit number 19 in the UK. As of July 2008, Midnite Vultures has sold 743,000 copies in the United States. The first 500,000 copies came in a digipak. A thirty-second segment of \"Beautiful Way\" has been bundled with Windows ME as a demo song for Windows Media Player 7, under the name \"beck.asf\". The song showcased Media Player's Internet integration by displaying a clickable image link. == Critical reception == Midnite Vultures was praised by most critics, and the album holds a score of 83 at Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Jon Pareles of Rolling Stone remarked that on Midnite Vultures, Beck \"plays the insider, riding the executive plane through the good life with every need fulfilled.\" Richard Cromelin of the Los Angeles Times wrote that he gives the album \"a cinematic richness, depth and detail with an array of mutations and surprises, from banjo hoedown to electronic effects\". The NME felt that the album, while narrower in scope than Odelay, is \"more immediate in impact\". Q praised Midnite Vultures as an often \"musically dazzling\" album, while noting that \"the one criticism that can be still levelled at Beck is that his songs remain strangely soulless, failing to ever really grip the emotions or stir the soul.\" In a mixed review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic states that while the album's initial songs are \"tight, catchy, and memorable, the production dense\", the \"awkward, misguided shift in tone\" of \"Hollywood Freaks\" gives the rest of the album the impression that \"for all the ingenuity, it's just a hipster joke.\" Robert Christgau of The Village Voice felt that \"his problem isn't that he tries to be funny, but that his jokes are as forced as his horn charts\", later giving it a one-star honorable mention rating and remarking that it \"does eventually get funky, if anybody cares but me.\" Midnite Vultures was nominated in 2001 for Album of the Year at the 43rd Grammy Awards. In 2006, Midnite Vultures was named the 50th \"Worst Album Ever\" by Q. Conversely, in 2013, NME ranked the album at number 307 in its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Beck – vocals, production; keyboards (tracks 1, 6, 7, 10), guitar (tracks 2, 6, 7, 9, 10), synthesizer (track 2, 4, 8), piano (track 2), vocoder (track 3, 8), choir vocals (track 4), bass synthesizer (track 5), backing vocals (tracks 6, 7, 10), handclaps (track 6), marimbas (track 7), harmonica (tracks 7, 9), acoustic guitar (track 8), bass (track 9), programming (tracks 1-4, 6-8, 10), mixing (tracks 1-6, 8), horn arrangements (tracks 1, 3, 6) *Justin Meldal- Johnsen – bass (tracks 1-8, 10), synthesizer (track 2), backing vocals (track 3), shaker (track 3), percussion (tracks 6, 7), handclaps (track 6), guitar (track 8), noise (10), upright bass (track 11) *Roger Joseph Manning Jr. – synthesizer (tracks 1-8, 10), piano (tracks 1, 2, 8, 10), tambourine (tracks 1, 9, 10), shaker (tracks 1, 10), clavinet (tracks 2, 7, 8), vocoder (track 3, 8), backing vocals (track 3, 10), choir vocals (track 4), organ (track 6, 11), percussion (tracks 6, 7), handclaps (track 6), acoustic guitar (track 7), guitar (track 8), electronic drums (track 8), keyboards (track 9), Fender Rhodes electric piano (track 11) *Smokey Hormel – guitar (tracks 1, 3, 8, 11) *Joey Waronker – drums (tracks 3, 7, 8, 10, 11), percussion (track 10) *David Arthur Brown – tenor sax (tracks 1, 2, 3, 6) *Jon Birdsong – trumpet (tracks 1, 2, 3, 6) *David Ralicke – trombone (tracks 1, 2, 3, 6) *Tony Hoffer – co- production (tracks 3, 4, 8, 10), mixing (tracks 3, 4, 8, 10), programming (tracks 3, 4, 5, 8, 10), sound design (4, 10), engineering (track 3, 4, 8, 10), guitar (track 3, 8) *David Campbell – viola (track 2), string arrangements (track 2), string conductor (track 2) *Larry Corbett – cello (track 2) *Joel Derouin – violin (track 2) *Brian Gardner – mastering *Bernie Grundman – mastering *Greg Leisz – pedal steel (track 9) *Jay Dee Maness – pedal steel (tracks 1, 9) *Johnny Marr – guitar (track 8) *Michael Patterson – mixing (tracks 1-6, 8, 11) *Herb Pedersen – banjo (tracks 1, 2) *Fernando Pullum – horn (track 11) *Joe Turano – horn (track 11), backing vocals (track 11) *Arnold McCuller – backing vocals (tracks 1, 2, 4, 5) *Beth Orton – backing vocals (track 9) *Chris Bellman – mastering *The Dust Brothers – production (tracks 5, 11), scratching (track 5), programming (track 5), engineering (track 5) *Robert Carranza – string engineer (track 2) *Steve Baxter – horn (track 11), backing vocals (track 11) *Steve Mixdorf – second engineer *Valerie Pinkston – backing vocals (1, 2, 4, 5) *Mickey Petralia – programming (tracks 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9), production (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9), engineering (tracks 1, 2, 4, 7, 9), mixing (track 1, 2, 6-10) *Shauna O'Brien – project manager *DJ Swamp – scratching (track 2) *Eve Butler – violin (track 2) *Charlie Gross – photography *Arroyo Bombers – gang chorus (track 5) *Arroyo Tabernacle Men's Chorale – choir (track 6) *Derek Carlson – second engineer *Eye – artwork, art direction, design, collage *Gimbop – layout direction *Michel Gondry – collage *SA ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1999) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Danish Albums (Hitlisten) | 26 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2000) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard 200 | 183 |} ==Certifications== ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1999 albums Category:Beck albums Category:Albums arranged by David Campbell (composer) Category:Albums produced by Tony Hoffer Category:DGC Records albums Category:Albums produced by the Dust Brothers Category:Microsoft Windows sample music Category:Albums produced by Beck Category:Albums produced by Mickey Petralia",
