Residents felt that the incorporation was imperative in order to maintain home rule. They also felt that by incorporating, they would be able to have services which they otherwise would not be able to have through the Town of North Hempstead. A plaque was installed at Village Hall in 1981 to commemorate the 70th Anniversary of Great Neck Estates' incorporation as a village. In 1982, Great Neck Estates became the first village on Long Island to call for a nuclear freeze between the United States and the former Soviet Union after trustees approved of a petition started by three concerned residents on the Great Neck Peninsula. Copies of their document were delivered to the leaders of both nations as peace efforts. ==Geography== thumb|left|U.S. Census map of Great Neck Estates.

It is said that Fitzgerald modeled West Egg, the fictional town in which Nick lived, next to the mansion of Jay Gatsby, after Great Neck (specifically Kings Point), for its epitome of nouveau riche gaudiness, atmosphere, and lifestyle. He modeled East Egg, the town where Daisy and Tom lived, after Great Neck's eastern neighbor Sands Point, which is part of Port Washington. ==References== == External links == * Official website Category:Great Neck Peninsula Category:Town of North Hempstead, New York Category:Villages in New York (state) Category:Villages in Nassau County, New York",
