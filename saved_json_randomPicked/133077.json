 "text": "Newport Township is a township in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. As of 2010, the population was 5,374. Newport is located on the outskirts of Nanticoke City. ==History== ===Establishment=== thumb|left|An old map of Newport Township Newport was incorporated as a township in 1790. It is one of the original townships in Luzerne County. The municipality derives its name from Newport, Rhode Island. The first settlement in modern-day Newport Township was established by Major Prince Alden in 1772. A few years later, his sons (Mason and John) erected a forge on Nanticoke Creek. One of the first stores in the territory was established by Jacob Ramback; it was constructed on a road between Wanamie and Nanticoke. Due to the growing coal mining industry in the Wyoming Valley (in the 19th century), farmers were selling large tracts of land to the coal companies. Even sawmills and gristmills were replaced by coal mines. Alden, Glen Lyon, and Wanamie were just a few of the mining villages in the township. Mine shafts and collieries were constructed throughout the territory. ===Boom and bust=== At the beginning of the 20th century, Luzerne County was in the midst of an economic boom. Industry, which included manufacturing and coal mining, drew thousands of immigrants (mostly from Europe) to the region. By the mid-20th century, anthracite production was declining at a fairly steady rate. Consumers were gradually switching from coal to other forms of energy (e.g., oil, gas, and electricity).Healey, Richard (2005) \"The Breakers of the Northern Anthracite Coalfield of Pennsylvania\", 'Vol. 1, Major breakers prior to 1902'. Dept of Geography, University of Portsmouth, Portsmouth. quote=\"Northern Anthracite Coalfield of Pennsylvania\" There also are Central and Southern Anthracite Coalfields of Pennsylvania, the one around Hazelton and the other around Pottsville.Sevon, W. D., compiler, 2000, , Pennsylvania Geological Survey of the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Pennsylvania Geological Survey, 4th ser., Map 13, scale 1:2,000,000. The Knox Mine Disaster was the final blow to the industry. On January 22, 1959, the Susquehanna River broke through the River Slope Mine in Port Griffith, Jenkins Township. The incident claimed twelve lives. In the following months, two of the area's largest coal companies announced a full withdrawal from the anthracite business. Thousands of jobs were lost and the mining industry never recovered in Luzerne County. ===Contemporary history=== St. Stanislaus Institute, also known as St. Stanislaus Orphanage and Holy Child Church, was built between 1918 and 1939. The facility served as a Catholic orphanage until it closed in 1972. St. Stanislaus was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. The building is now occupied by apartments. Holy Child closed in 2010. A nursing home was built nearby. In 1986, State Correctional Institute at Retreat opened in northwestern Newport Township, replacing the mental hospital. SCI Retreat closed in June 2020. It iwas a medium security correctional facility for men. ==Geography== According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.49%, is water. Most of the township is forested. It is drained by the Susquehanna River (which forms its northern boundary). The northern and southern portions are mountainous. The elevation of Penobscot Mountain reaches above sea level along the township's southern border with Slocum Township. Most of the people live in the basin of Newport Creek, which flows northeast from Glen Lyon to the Susquehanna River (in Nanticoke). Newport Township consists of the communities of Alden Station, Glen Lyon, Lee, Newport Center, Sheatown, and Wanamie. The State Correctional Institute at Retreat is in a remote area of the municipality (along the Susquehanna River). The facility can only be accessed by a bridge over the river from U.S. Route 11 or by helicopter. ===Neighboring municipalities=== *Nanticoke (northeast) *Hanover Township (east) *Nuangola (southeast) *Slocum Township (south) *Conyngham Township (west) *Union Township (northwest) *Hunlock Township (north) *Plymouth Township (north) ==Government officials== * Township manager: Joseph Hillan * Commissioners:http://www.newporttownship.org/officials.htm ** John Zyla — President of Board of Commissioners/Police Dept. ** Michael Roke — Fire Dept. ** John Vishnefski — Parks and Recreation Dept. ** Deborah Forgach Zaleski — Code Enforcement Dept. *Police chief: Jeremy Blank *Fire chief: Jason Kowalski == Public safety == * Police: The Newport Township Police Department provides full time police coverage to township residents. * Fire: Fire suppression is provided by the Newport Township Fire Department (Luzerne County Station 163).
