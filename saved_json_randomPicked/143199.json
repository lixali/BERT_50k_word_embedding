 "text": "Rubén Rodríguez (born August 5, 1953) is a Puerto Rican former basketball player. Born in New York City, he played 23 seasons in the Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN) tournament. Many people consider either him to be, along with José Ortíz, Raymond Dalmau, Juan Vicens, Rafael Valle, Georgie Torres or Mario Morales, the greatest or one of the greatest basketball players in Puerto Rico's national tournament's history. He was one of only five players (Morales, Dalmau, Georgie Torres and Mario Butler being the other four) to reach 10,000 or more points during his BSN career, and for a long time, was the second best scorer ever behind Dalmau. Rodríguez spent his whole career with the Vaqueros de Bayamon of Bayamón. With the Vaqueros, he won 8 national championships, in 1969, five in a row from 1971 to 1975, one in 1981 and one in 1988, the year that the team inaugurated his actual venue, that carries his name, the Rubén Rodríguez Coliseum. He also garnered the MVP award in 1979, and, once the three-point shot was established for the first time in the Puerto Rican tournament during the 1980 season, he started making shots from behind the three-point line too. Rodríguez was a member of the Puerto Rican national basketball team, playing in many international tournaments such as the Olympic Games and Pan American Games. Rodríguez for Team Puerto Rico played against Michael Jordan for Team USA, at the coliseum named after Rodríguez, in 1983. He retired from basketball in 1991. He tried several times to coach a basketball team in the Puerto Rico League, BSN, but without success. His most recent attempt was with the Bayamón team in 2002. He started the season 0-5 and was eventually fired. He is now a basketball analyst for several radio shows in Puerto Rico. ==References== == External links == * Gallery of Pictures of Puerto Rican players at enciclopediapr.org * Statistics in BSN Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:Baloncesto Superior Nacional players Category:Basketball players at the 1971 Pan American Games Category:Basketball players at the 1972 Summer Olympics Category:Basketball players at the 1975 Pan American Games Category:Basketball players at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:Basketball players at the 1979 Pan American Games Category:Basketball players at the 1983 Pan American Games Category:Basketball players from New York City Category:BSN coaches Category:LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds men's basketball players Category:Olympic basketball players of Puerto Rico Category:Puerto Rican men's basketball players Category:1974 FIBA World Championship players Category:1978 FIBA World Championship players Category:Puerto Rico men's national basketball team players Category:Pan American Games silver medalists for Puerto Rico Category:Pan American Games medalists in basketball Category:Centers (basketball) Category:Power forwards (basketball) Category:Medalists at the 1971 Pan American Games Category:Medalists at the 1979 Pan American Games Category:Medalists at the 1975 Pan American Games",
