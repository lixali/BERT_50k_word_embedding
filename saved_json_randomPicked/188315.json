 "text": "Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea is the fifth studio album by English alternative rock musician PJ Harvey, released on 24 October 2000 by Island Records. Recorded during March to April 2000, it contains themes of love that are tied into Harvey's affection for New York City. The album became the second major commercial success of her recording career, following her successful breakthrough To Bring You My Love (1995). Upon its release, the album received acclaim from most music critics and earned Harvey several accolades, including the 2001 Mercury Prize. It spent 17 weeks on the UK Albums Chart, and was certified Platinum in the UK and Australia. It is generally regarded as one of her best works. ==Background and music== In 1998, while shooting a film as an actress for Hal Hartley in New York, she felt inspired by the city and wrote several songs. Some of them ended up on the following album. In 1999, she chose to live there for nine months. However, she insisted in interviews it was not \"my New York album\". Songs were also written while she was in London or at home in Dorset. Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea was then recorded at the Great Linford Manor in Milton Keynes in March–April 2000. The record was co-produced by Mick Harvey, Rob Ellis and Harvey, and mixed by Victor Van Vugt at the Fallout Shelter. The album featured a duet with Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke on the track \"This Mess We're In\", as well as backing vocals and keyboards from Yorke on the songs \"One Line\" and \"Beautiful Feeling\". She had met Yorke in 1992 and they had stayed in contact. She said: \"I'd long been interested in the idea of somebody else singing a whole song on a record of mine, to have a very different dimension brought in by somebody else's voice. It adds so much dynamic within the record to have this other character coming in\". She wanted the record to be more direct: \"It's very different musically to the first couple of albums. It's very melodic, and it's much rounder and fuller. The earlier albums were very black and white in some sense, very extreme. Melodically, this is much more sophisticated than those records. It kind of feels like a combination of every album I've made so far rolled into one.\" The songs were also a musical departure from her previous dark material. Harvey told Q in 2001, \"I wanted everything to sound as beautiful as possible. Having experimented with some dreadful sounds on Is This Desire? and To Bring You My Love - where I was really looking for dark, unsettling, nauseous-making sounds - Stories From The City... was the reaction. I thought, No, I want absolute beauty. I want this album to sing and fly and be full of reverb and lush layers of melody. I want it to be my beautiful, sumptuous, lovely piece of work.\" She did, however, concede jokingly that it was only \"pop according to PJ Harvey, which is probably as un-pop as you can get according to most people's standards.\" Pitchfork compared her voice on the lead single \"Good Fortune\" to that of Chrissie Hynde, while the Los Angeles Times observed: \"Her singing often recalls Patti Smith and Siouxsie Sioux, artists who, like Harvey, project a sexuality derived from--yet never bound by--rock's male sensibilities.\" ==Release and commercial performance== The album was released on 24 October 2000. on album, and promoted with a video for the lead single \"Good Fortune\", shot at night in streets of New York. It reached number 23 on the UK Albums Chart. The album was certified Platinum in the UK, with sales over 300,000 copies. The album debuted at number 42 on the US Billboard 200 chart.Columnist.
