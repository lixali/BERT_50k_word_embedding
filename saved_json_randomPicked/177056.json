On February 3, 2001, she married football player Luis García. The marriage was dissolved on September 1, 2004. In August 2009, del Castillo married Aarón Díaz in a Las Vegas ceremony. On July 26, 2011, it was announced that Kate and Díaz were separating. Del Castillo was briefly romantically connected with Sean Penn from 2015 to 2016, although the actor's representatives contest this. It has been frequently asserted in the media that del Castillo was romantically involved with Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán, allegations that the actress vehemently denies. On August 22, 2005, it was reported by the LAPD that del Castillo's new house in Los Angeles had been broken into by thieves, who took some jewelry from the actress. Del Castillo was in Los Angeles filming Bordertown, a film about the female homicides in Ciudad Juárez, when the burglary occurred. A frequent activist for a variety of causes, she posed in a 2012 PETA ad campaign encouraging pet owners to \"fiercely protect\" their dogs and cats by keeping them indoors.\"Kate del Castillo, la nueva cara de PETA ,\" Huffpost Voces, May 11, 2012. She became a citizen of the United States in September 2015 and resides in Los Angeles. During an interview with Cristina Saralegui on the Cristina Show, del Castillo revealed that her favorite band is the English new wave band Duran Duran. ===Relationship with El Chapo=== On January 9, 2012, del Castillo publicly posted an essay on Twitter (using Twextra) discussing social issues in Mexico that included controversial statements directed towards Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán, the infamous head of the Sinaloa Cartel. The essay included requests to Mr. Guzmán to \"deal with love, with good things\" and to \"[begin to] traffic in love.\" The most controversial portion of the essay stated: \"Today I believe more in Chapo Guzmán [than in] the government that hides painful truths from me, that hides the cure for cancer, AIDS, etc., for their own benefit and wealth.\" thumb|upright|del Castillo in 2017 Unbeknownst to del Castillo, Guzmán was a longtime fan who harbored romantic feelings for her. Authorities found DVDs of La Reina del Sur at the safe house stormed during Guzmán's initial capture. Del Castillo was contacted by Guzmán's lawyer to discuss producing a biographical film about Guzmán in 2014. As a result of the meetings, she obtained the rights to his life and was unknowingly placed under CISEN surveillance. Communication increased following Guzmán's escape from prison in July 2015. She received a cell phone and the code names Hermosa and Dama from Guzmán. She brokered an interview between American actor Sean Penn and Guzmán in October 2015, shortly before Mexican Marines recaptured him (del Castillo claims in her documentary for Netflix that she did not know Penn intended to interview the drug lord during the meeting). CISEN later released photographs of del Castillo at the meetings with Guzmán's lawyer and of the arrival of the actress and Penn to Mexico. ====Aftermath==== Sean Penn and Del Castillo's actions remain under investigation by the Attorney General of Mexico. She was subpoenaed on January 18, 2016 and was to testify before the public prosecutor at the Mexican Consulate in Los Angeles. Del Castillo was originally under investigation for money laundering in relation to the planned movie about Guzmán and her tequila brand Honor del Castillo. The investigation was suspended in 2017 as there was no evidence that proved that Guzmán ever paid del Castillo any money. On February 5, 2016, a Mexican judge granted del Castillo's petition for an injunction against any arrest related to the federal investigation into her ties with Joaquín Guzmán. The Mexican Attorney General issued a detain-and-interrogate order on del Castillo; however, that would only become effective if del Castillo set foot on Mexican soil. That order was issued after she did not heed a request to voluntarily appear before Mexican prosecutors. Kate del Castillo has not returned to Mexico since the injunction was issued and filming locations for Ingobernable were changed to San Diego to accommodate restrictions on her travel. The Day I Met El Chapo: The Kate del Castillo Story premiered in 2017 on Netflix, based on the events surrounding del Castillo's communications with El Chapo. ==Filmography== thumb|upright|Kate at the 2015 Miami Film Festival ===Film=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
