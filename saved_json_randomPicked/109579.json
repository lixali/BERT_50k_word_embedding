Sun-Sentinel, December 13, 2006. Retrieved January 7, 2007. Around the time of the Great Depression, he allowed tourists, who brought their trailers down from the North, to camp on his land. He began advertising the land by placing flyers in Northern newspapers, such as the Chicago Tribune, that touted Briny's \"$3 a week rent.\"DeGregory, Lane. A Price on Paradise. St. Petersburg Times, February 5, 2006. Retrieved January 7, 2007. In 1958, Miller wanted to retire and made an offer to the campers to buy the land: $2,000 per lot and $2,500 for those near the water. The campers brought their assets together and the town was incorporated on March 19, 1963, complete with its own mayor and post office.Luscombe, Richard. Backstory: Briny beach memoirs.

In its beginnings, the town was mainly made up of families that came to live during the winter. Now, the residents are senior citizens that live there either year round or just in the winter. Briny Breezes was used as the setting for the 2005 film In Her Shoes, and many of its residents served as extras in the movie.Production Notes: In Her Shoes. CinemaReview.com. Retrieved 2008-02-24. ==Development== In October 2005, developer Jean Francois Roy, of Ocean Land Investments, made an offer to buy the entire town for $500 million. This would equate to an average of slightly more than $1 million per residential lot. In December 2005, it was announced that 73 percent of the 488 lot owners had voted to hire a lawyer to pursue the sale.Cornwall, Rupert. Briny Breezes trailer park offered $500m to blow away . The Independent, December 28, 2005. Retrieved January 7, 2007. Later, Roy raised his offer to $510 million. Had the sale gone through, it would have meant a huge windfall for each lot owner. Many people paid between $30,000 and $40,000 when they purchased their homes. In comparison, the 2000 census reported $129,000 was the median value of a home in Briny. A vote to ratify the deal was set for January 10, 2007 and 80 percent of residents approved of the sale, with 97 percent of owners voting. The residents would not receive any compensation until 2009 and the plan was yet to be approved by state and local officials, due to zoning concerns.Kennedy, Kelli. Mobile home owners may share millions. Associated Press, January 11, 2007. Retrieved January 15, 2007.
