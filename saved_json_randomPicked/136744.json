The population was 3,524 at the 2010 census. ==History== Founded in 1873, Wills Point gets its name from an early American settler, William Wills, who had arrived in the area circa 1848.\"Wills Point Chronicle.\" Obituary. 1924 June. Wills eventually purchased a cabin from Adam Sullivan in 1852. The name 'point' may also derive from the shape of the original timberline near the cabin, though there have been unsubstantiated arguments that the name relates to the area's elevation. The layout of the city was the work of engineer General Grenville M. Dodge of the California Construction Company. The downtown streets were laid with red bricks upon packed sand in the 1920s by locals and remain in use.
