Many of the elders continue speaking Yucatec Maya. The village had milpas since 1886 but was permanently settled around 1915 by Maya people who came from the Caste War of Yucat√°n. Many before reaching San Pablo, lived a semi Nomadic life moving from one place to another seeking new land to do milpas and the search for peace. ==External links== *Simply Belize *Orange Walk Town.
