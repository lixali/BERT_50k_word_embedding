 "text": "Mount Oliver is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is a largely residential area situated atop a crest about west of the Monongahela River. The borough is surrounded entirely by the city of Pittsburgh, having resisted annexations by the city, as it prefers to manage its own local needs and finances. It is named for Oliver Ormsby, son of John Ormsby, who held the original land grant for the area from George III. Mount Oliver has experienced some tough times of late which are associated with the slippage of the steel-making capacity of the Pittsburgh region.
