The first Europeans to visit the place were Captain James Cook and botanist Sir Joseph Banks. It is covered with diverse vegetation including mangroves, littoral rainforest and coastal vine thickets, freshwater paperbark swamps, eucalypt forests and much more. ==Visitor facilities== Eurimbula National Park consists of three separate sections. The main section is centred on Eurimbula Creek and is accessible (4WD recommended) from the main Agnes Water road. There are camping facilities at Bustard Beach near the mouth of Eurimbula Creek. Inland, a short uphill walk leads to a lookout, known as Ganoonga Noonga, with views of the coast and paperbark swamps of the park. Further north, there is another camping ground at Middle Creek; however, there are no facilities here. The northern section of the park includes Rodds Peninsula and Bustard Head and its lighthouse; nearby is Jenny Lind Creek.Eurimbula National Park, Department of Environment and Science, Queensland Government Tours from the Town of 1770 regularly visit Bustard Head; however, Rodds Peninsula is accessible only by private boat.
