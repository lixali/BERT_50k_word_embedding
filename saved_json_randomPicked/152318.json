 "text": "Rastrick is a village in the county of West Yorkshire, England, between Halifax, 5 miles (8 km) north-east and Huddersfield, 4 miles (7 km) south. The population of the Calderdale Civil Ward at the 2011 census was 11,351. It is perhaps best known for its association, along with its neighbour Brighouse, 1 mile (2 km) north-east, with the Brighouse and Rastrick Brass Band. Along with Brighouse, it is part of Calderdale, but shares a Huddersfield postcode and phone number. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, the village is on an incline facing north-east, the Parish Church, is vertically in the middle. The area around the Parish Church is known as \"Top o' t'Town\" and the area around the Junction public house is known as \"Bottom o' t'Town\", this reflects the days when Rastrick had its own governance in the form of a Town Board whose Offices and lock-up were situated halfway between the two, on Ogden Lane. Remains of a fort have been found at Castle Hill, just below Top o' Town. ==History== The name Rastrick is thought to be Viking in origin, with the \"..ick\" formation being common to many Norwegian Viking placenames, including \"Jorvick\", the Viking name for York. Rastrick is well known for its pubs and the \"Rastrick Run\" is a popular pub crawl. Rastrick, and the variation Raistrick are English surnames, originating from the area of the town. ==Governance== Rastrick is a village and a ward of Calderdale, a metropolitan borough within the ceremonial county of West Yorkshire in England. The parish of Rastrick was recorded on 1 July 1837 as part of the Halifax Registration District. It was abolished as a distinct parish on 1 April 1937 and merged with the neighbouring parish of Brighouse as part of the Borough of Brighouse. On 1 April 1938 the borough was transferred to the neighbouring registration district of 'Calder' and in 1974 it was abolished as part of the creation of Calderdale. Rastrick became a ward of Calderdale, with boundaries similar to those of the original parish. ==Geography== The ward of Rastrick is bordered to the north by the River Calder, which separates it from the ward of Brighouse. To the east and south the border with the Kirklees ward of Ashbrow roughly follows the M62 motorway. The traditional north western boundary between Elland and Rastrick was the edge of the escarpment, but the Elland Ward boundary is further east, encompassing parts of the old parish of Rastrick as far as Dewsbury Road and the crossroads with New Hey Road. The village is neighboured by the towns of Brighouse to the north and Elland to the west. The village of Fixby is to the south east and Ainley Top is to the south west. ==Community facilities== Rastrick has its own Library which can be found on Crowtrees Lane and a Doctors surgery at Rastrick Health Centre which is on Chapel Croft. A second Doctors surgery is situated at the junction of Castle Avenue and Field Top Road. ==Landmarks== The highest point in the village is Round Hill which is adjacent to the grounds of Rastrick Cricket Club. This appears man made but is thought to be of natural origin. The Clough House Inn, on Clough Lane, is easily seen from the nearby M62. It was originally the White Lion Inn which was built in 1824, and is named as such on the 1835 and 1850 maps. ==Transport== The nearest railway station is in Brighouse but is near Rastrick. An extensive bus service is provided by several operators, including First and Team Pennine, under the guidance of the West Yorkshire Metro. ==Education== Rastrick has several primary schools, including Carr Green Junior, Infant and Nursery School, Castlefields Infants School, Field Lane Primary School and Longroyde Junior School. Rastrick High School is the secondary school for the area. The William Henry Smith School is a special school located on Boothroyd Lane.
