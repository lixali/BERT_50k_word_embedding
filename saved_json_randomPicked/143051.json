It borders onto Dumfries and Galloway, East Ayrshire and North Ayrshire. On 30 June 2020, the population of South Ayrshire was 112,140. Following the 2017 council election, the Labour Party and the Scottish National Party (SNP) announced an agreement to control the council, supported by both independent councillors, despite the fact that the Conservatives emerged as the largest single party on the council with twelve of the twenty-eight elected members, with the SNP's Douglas Campbell serving as Leader of the Council and Labour's Helen Moonie returning as Provost. South Ayrshire is currently one of the Scottish bids competing for city status as part of the Queens Platinum Jubilee celebrations in 2022. ==Overview and history== ===Creation and history=== The administrative boundaries were formed in 1996 as a direct successor to the Kyle and Carrick district council area, with the district of Dalmellington – located along the south-east of Kyle and Carrick – being transferred over to the newly formed East Ayrshire Council area. South Ayrshire's Headquarters, County Buildings, are located in Wellington Square, Ayr. ===Geography and climate=== Geographically, South Ayrshire is located on the western coast of Scotland, sharing borders with neighbouring local authorities East Ayrshire, Dumfries and Galloway and North Ayrshire. The climate in South Ayrshire, typical of that in Western Scotland, is milder than that of Eastern Scotland due to the stronger maritime influence, as the prevailing winds blow from the sea into South Ayrshire, which is located primarily on the western coast of Scotland. The warm Gulf Stream also has a strong influence on Western Scotland. With winds mainly blowing from the sea the annual mean temperatures are in the range in coastal areas of South Ayrshire such as Ayr and Troon. The sea reaches its lowest temperature in February or early March so that on average February is the coldest month in some coastal parts of South Ayrshire along with the Rinns of Galloway, Kintyre and the Hebrides. In February the mean daily minimum temperature varies from about 2 °C in most of the islands, 1 to 2 °C along most of the Solway Firth and lowland inland areas, but less than −1 °C in parts of the Southern Uplands and central Highlands. Inland, where the influence of the sea is less, January is the coldest month with mean daily minimum temperatures generally between −3 and 0 °C. The number of hours of natural sunshine in South Ayrshire is controlled by the length of day and by cloudiness. In general, December is the dullest month and May or June the sunniest. Sunshine duration decreases with increasing altitude, increasing latitude and distance from the coast. Local topography also exerts a strong influence and in the winter deep glens and north-facing slopes can be in shade for long periods. Industrial pollution and smoke haze can also reduce sunshine amounts, but the decline in heavy industry in the Ayrshire area, primarily in Ayr in South Ayrshire along with Kilmarnock in East Ayrshire, has resulted in an increase in sunshine duration particularly in the winter months. Average annual rainfall totals range from less than in the upper Clyde valley and along the coasts of Ayrshire and Dumfries and Galloway to on average over over the higher parts of the west Highlands, approaching the maximum values found in the UK (over further north). ===Settlements=== South Ayrshire's population is mostly concentrated around the adjoining coastal towns of Ayr, Prestwick and Troon located to the north-west of the council, which represents 68% of the council's total population according to data derived from the 2011 census, with a combined population of 76,846. Other areas of significance include the towns of Maybole and Girvan which are located to the south of the council area in the district of Carrick. A list of settlements in South Ayrshire may be found below: ====Towns==== *Ayr *Girvan *Prestwick *Troon *Maybole ====Villages and hamlets==== *Alloway (Suburb of Ayr) *Annbank *Ballantrae *Barassie (Suburb of Troon) *Barr *Barrhill *Colmonell *Coodham *Coylton *Craigie *Crosshill *Dailly *Dundonald *Dunure *Failford *Joppa (Suburb of Coylton) *Kirkmichael *Kirkoswald *Lendalfoot *Loans *Maidens *Monkton *Mossblown *Minishant *Old Dailly *Pinmore *Pinwherry *Straiton *Symington *Tarbolton *Turnberry ===Places of interest=== *Ailsa Craig *Bachelor's Club, Tarbolton *Bargany Gardens *Blairquhan *Burns Cottage *Burns National Heritage Park (Robert Burns) *Carrick Forest *Crossraguel Abbey *Culzean Castle *Electric Brae *Penkill Castle *Souter Johnnie's Cottage *Royal Troon Golf Club *Turnberry Hotel and Golf Course ===Economy=== thumb|right|Rural landscape in South Ayrshire, a common source of employment through agriculture and farming industries The economy of South Ayrshire, like many other areas, was badly affected during the worldwide financial crisis from 2009–2012. Despite this, total Gross Value Added for South Ayrshire has seen a steady increase over the last 20 years, reaching a peak in 2015 of £2.4 million. South Ayrshire’s GVA represents 1.9% of the total Scottish Gross Value Added income which is consistent with the previous 20 years. The largest employment industry in South Ayrshire and Scotland is the public admin, education and health sector. Compared with Scotland, proportionally there are more South Ayrshire residents employed in this sector than Scotland, while there are proportionally fewer employed in banking, finance and insurance sector than Scotland. Despite being a costal area, the smallest employment in South Ayrshire is in the agriculture and fishing sector. In 2008, South Ayrshire Council established the Economic Development Partnership, with the main purpose of the partnership of working with partners to develop the local economy of South Ayrshire for the benefit of its businesses and residents and to attract visitors and inward investment. The Partnership has responsibility for delivering the Prosperous, Learning and Achieving related outcomes of the South Ayrshire Single Outcome Agreement. These include objectives related to supporting business development and growth, promoting learning and employability, developing tourism and the social economy and improving transport links and infrastructure. The Partnership currently has three sub groups which progress much of the operational work needed to deliver outcomes related services namely: * Lifelong Learning Partnership: responsible for community based learning and literacies services. * South Ayrshire Employability Partnership: responsible for employment and training services. * Local Social Economy Partnership: responsible for developing and supporting social enterprises. The following organisations are currently members of the Partnership: * Associated British Ports * Glasgow Prestwick International Airport * Visitscotland * University of the West of Scotland * Scotland’s Rural College * Ayrshire College * Scottish Enterprise * Skills Development Scotland * Scotland Ayrshire Chamber of Commerce and Industry * Jobcentre Plus * Strathclyde Partnership for Transport * South Ayrshire Council Planning and Enterprise Service * South Ayrshire Local Social Economy Partnership * Ayr Renaissance ===Communities=== In South Ayrshire, the council places an emphasis on Community Planning being based on the core idea that if everyone works more effectively together then public services will improve for those who use them (within South Ayrshire). Community Planning starts with the service providers, such as South Ayrshire Council, the National Health Service (NHS Ayrshire and Arran) and Police Scotland, whereby they engage with local communities and service users to find out what their needs are and then jointly agree on priorities. The next stage is to jointly design local services to meet these identified priorities and ensure that they are delivered effectively. Following an independent review of community planning in South Ayrshire which took place throughout 2014, new priorities and governance structures were agreed, including the establishment of a Community Planning Executive, three new Strategic Delivery Partnerships to deliver these priorities which include Economy & Employment, Health & Wellbeing and Community Safety. A Shortlife Working Group on Prevention and Early Intervention has also been set up as part of the new arrangements. The Community Planning Board is the executive and decision making body of the South Ayrshire Community Planning Partnership (CPP). The board is chaired by the Leader of the Council, currently Councillor Douglas Campbell of the Scottish National Party. It makes decisions on priorities, strategic outcomes and objectives for the Community Planning Partnership in South Ayrshire where it has responsibility for the delivery of the South Ayrshire Single Outcome Agreement. The board is composed of various councillors and officials within South Ayrshire Council, as well as the Chief Executive, Eileen Howatt, Tim Eltringham, the Director of Health & Social Care at the South Ayrshire Partnership and Heather Dunk OBE, currently the principal of Ayrshire College (which has one of its main campuses in Ayr, the administrative town of South Ayrshire Council). ===Education=== Educational provision in South Ayrshire is offered via eight secondary schools, forty-one primary schools, two special needs schools and five stand-alone Early Years Centres (although some primary schools have Early Years Centres attached). In terms of early years provision, there are also a number of private establishments which are operated in conjunction with South Ayrshire Council, rather than managed and operated entirely by the council. Based on figures from the 2016-2017 academic year, within South Ayrshire, there were 6,091 secondary school aged pupils, 7,855 primary school aged pupils and 251 pupils attending special educational needs provision establishments. Educational Services within South Ayrshire Council, which is currently managed by Douglas Hutchinson, is responsible for all aspects of educational provision within the authority, including primary, secondary, early years, out of school care, creche services, pupil attainment, behaviour, behaviour management strategies and pupil welfare. Across South Ayrshire, a number of schools have either undergone a period of extensive refurbishment or complete rebuilding. In the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire in June 2017, in July 2017 it was highlighted that three schools within South Ayrshire – Marr College, Ayr Academy and Dalmilling Primary, were clad with the same cladding that caused the widespread of the fire at Grenfell Tower which is led to speculate why the fire was able to spread so quickly. Due to the low rise nature of the school building, South Ayrshire has issued a statement in which it states it is \"fully confident\" in the structure and design of the schools, and that the cladding used meets the strict fire restrictions used in building and planning operations in Scotland, further highlighting that all schools are fitted with enhanced fire prevention equipment such as sprinkler systems, fire alarms and vigorous fire evacuation procedures, in which Grenfell Tower did not. South Ayrshire Council owns, operates and managed out-of-school care provision for children aged 3–14 years, taking children from early years, primary and the first few years of secondary school provision. The Out of School Care provision within South Ayrshire is operated at five care clubs– Muirhead (Troon), Symington, Mossblown, Colyton and Dundonald. In recent years, the staffing structure of after school care has changed to meet the demands of the wider council budget, and as of 2017, care clubs operated by South Ayrshire Council employ a Play Leader, responsible for the day-to-day operation of the service, alongside a Play Assistant, who assists in the provision and carries out responsibilities that can be delegate from the Play Leader or someone acting on their behalf. Staff employed to operate the care clubs are employed to provide child- centered play experiences for children which meet their individual needs and promote a safe and secure environment. Following on from Scotland's first Play Strategy introduced in 2013, South Ayrshire Council launched their own Let's Play - A Strategy for Early Learning and Childcare services in South Ayrshire policy in 2017 which runs until 2020. Care Clubs operated by South Ayrshire Council are registered with both the Care Inspectorate and the Childcare and Recreation Service (CARIS). Like the educational services within South Ayrshire Council, the Childcare Services department, being part of the wider Educational Services, is managed by Douglas Hutchinson, Head of Educational Services. In line with most other Scottish local authorities, South Ayrshire Council has undertaken measures to ensure that services such as education and social work become more streamlined to ensure it is easier for professionals from both professions to communicate and share information in relation to children's care, welfare, learning and development. The Health and Social Care department within South Ayrshire, whilst being responsible for others such as the elderly, is an example of a more streamlined and integrated service to ensure all professionals are getting it right for the young people in South Ayrshire. The Health and Social Care Partnership department in South Ayrshire was established in 2015 under the provisions of the Public Bodies (Joint Working) (Scotland) Act, 2014. The department is governed by an Integration Joint Board which is made up of eight voting members appointed by South Ayrshire Council as well as the NHS Ayrshire and Arran Board. Representatives from other sectors including the third sector (private sector), the independent sector, staff representatives and others representing the interests of patients, service users, carers and professionals also sit on the Board and contribute to its work. Separate Integration Joint Boards have also been established in the North Ayrshire and East Ayrshire Council authorities. The South Ayrshire Child Protection Committee is the main local strategic planning partnership which has responsibility for delivering continuous improvement in protecting children in South Ayrshire. Primarily, it involves the design, development, dissemination and evaluation of inter-agency child protection policy, procedures and practice in establishments. It has a responsibility to promote awareness of child protection to the local public and promote good practice within and across agencies, as well as leading on child protection training and development within South Ayrshire to all relevant professionals, such as Social Workers, Teachers, Pupil Support Assistants and Head Teachers. ===Bid for city status=== In 2021, South Ayrshire announced a candidacy to be recognised as a city and submitted a bid as part of the 2022 Platinum Jubilee Celebrations. The bid is based on the areas rich history and links to royalty, amongst other considerations. The granting of city status aims to boost tourism and recognition of the wider South Ayrshire area, and has received backing from organisations and businesses including Ayrshire College and Scottish Enterprise.https://www.south-ayrshire.gov.uk/media/3325/SAC-Platinum-Civic- Honours-competition- brochure/pdf/SAC_Platinum_Civic_Honours_competion_brochure_2021_final.pdf?m=637751762302000000 If successful, South Ayrshire would become only the third city to be an \"area based\" city, with the other two being the City of London and the City of Westminster. ==Politics and governance== ===Council structure=== South Ayrshire Council is one of thirty-two local authority areas of Scotland. Its political structure consists of one Leader of the Council, one Deputy Leader of the Council and one Provost. Following the 2017 Council election, the Scottish Conservative Party returned twelve councillors, the Scottish National Party returned nine councillors, Scottish Labour returned five councillors and two independent councillors were elected to the Council. The Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party returned the largest number of councillors, but did not have a majority. The Scottish National Party formed a working group along with Scottish Labour and the two independent councillors to run the council after the Scottish Conservatives failed to reach a deal with Scottish Labour, who had previously supported the Conservative-led administration following the 2012 Council election. South Ayrshire's provost, Helen Moonie (Scottish Labour Party), has been Provost of South Ayrshire since her appointment to the post in 2012 and was re-elected to serve as Provost in 2017. The Provost of South Ayrshire is apolitical, which sees the post-holder carry out various duties across the authority acting as First Citizen of South Ayrshire. The Provost is mostly responsible for chairing meetings of the Council whilst ensuring the proper conduct of business in terms of the Council's Standing Orders. The Provost's role also involves representing the Council as its Civic Head at various events and working with numerous community groups, businesses and voluntary organisations in the interests of the local community. ===Local council elections results=== {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#e9e9e9; border-bottom:2px solid gray;\"|Party ! colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\"|Members |- style=\"background:#e9e9e9; border-bottom:2px solid gray;\" !1995† !1999† !2003† !2007 !2012 !2017 |- |bgcolor=\"\" align=\"center\"| |Conservative |4 |13 |15 |12 |10 |12 |- |bgcolor=\"\" align=\"center\" width=\"5\"|• |SNP |0 |0 |0 |8 |9 |9 |- |bgcolor=\"\"|• |Labour |21 |17 |15 |9 |9 |5 |- |bgcolor=\"\" align=\"center\"|• |Independent |0 |0 |0 |1 |2 |2 |} † denotes an election held under the first- past-the-post electoral system.
