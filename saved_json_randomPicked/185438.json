Frescoes discovered on the Aegean island of Thera (modern Santorini, Greece) depict individuals with long braided hair or long dreadlocks. In ancient Egypt, examples of Egyptians wearing locked hairstyles and wigs have appeared on bas-reliefs, statuary and other artifacts. Mummified remains of Egyptians with locked wigs have also been recovered from archaeological sites.Egyptian Museum -\"Return of the Mummy. Toronto Life - 2002.\" Retrieved 01-26-2007. During the Bronze Age and Iron Age many peoples in the Near East, Anatolia, Caucasus, East Mediterranean and North Africa such as the Sumerians, Elamites and Ancient Egyptians were depicted in art with braided or plaited hair and beards. However, braids are not dreadlocks, and it is not always possible to tell from these images which are being depicted. ===Etymology=== The history of the name \"dreadlocks\" is unclear. Some authors said it originated from Rastafarians, who believe they represent a biblical hair style worn as a symbol of devotion by the Nazirites, as described in . == History == In Ancient Greece, kouros sculptures from the archaic period depict men wearing dreadlocks. The style was worn by Ancient Christian Ascetics in the Middle East and Mediterranean, and the Dervishes of Islam, among others. Some of the very earliest adherents of Christianity in the Middle East may have worn this hairstyle; there are descriptions of James the Just, first Bishop of Jerusalem, who is said to have worn them to his ankles.Glazier, Stephen D., Encyclopedia of African and African-American Religions, Taylor & Francis, 2001, , , p. 279. Pre-Columbian Aztec priests were described in Aztec codices (including the Durán Codex, the Codex Tudela and the Codex Mendoza) as wearing their hair untouched, allowing it to grow long and curl around itself.Berdán, Frances F. and Rieff Anawalt, Patricia (1997). The Essential Codex Mendoza. London, England: University of California Press. pp 149. Bernal Diaz del Castillo records: > here were priests with long robes of black cloth ... The hair of these > priests was very long and so knotted that it could not be separated or > disentangled, and most of them had their ears scarified, and their hair was > clotted with blood. In Senegal, the Baye Fall, followers of the Mouride movement, a Sufi movement of Islam founded in 1887 AD by Shaykh Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke, are famous for growing dreadlocks and wearing multi-colored gowns. Cheikh Ibra Fall, founder of the Baye Fall school of the Mouride Brotherhood, popularized the style by adding a mystic touch to it. Warriors among the Fulani, Wolof and Serer in Mauritania, and Mandinka in Mali were known for centuries to have worn cornrows when young and dreadlocks when old. Larry Wolff in his book Inventing Eastern Europe: The Map of Civilization on the Mind of Enlightenment mentions that in Poland, for about a thousand years, some people wore a knotted hairstyle similar to that of some Scythians. Zygmunt Gloger in his Encyklopedia staropolska mentions that the Polish plait (plica polonica) hairstyle was worn by some people in the Pinsk region and the Masovia region at the beginning of the 19th century. The Polish plait can vary between one large plait and multiple plaits that resemble dreadlocks. thumb|A drawing of peasants with \"Polish plaits\" == By culture == thumb|Hippie dreadlocks decorated with beads Locks have been worn for various reasons in each culture. Their use has also been raised in debates about cultural appropriation. === Africa === Maasai warriors are known for their long, thin, red dreadlocks, dyed with red root extracts or red ochre. In Nigeria, dreadlocks are viewed in a negative light due to their stereotypical association with gangs and criminal activity; men with dreadlocks face profiling from Nigerian police. === Australia === Some Indigenous Australians of North West and North Central Australia have historically worn their hair in a locked style, sometimes also having long beards that are fully or partially locked. Traditionally, some wear the dreadlocks loose, while others wrap the dreadlocks around their heads, or bind them at the back of the head. In North Central Australia, the tradition is for the dreadlocks to be greased with fat and coated with red ochre, which assists in their formation. === Buddhism === Within Tibetan Buddhism and other more esoteric forms of Buddhism, locks have occasionally been substituted for the more traditional shaved head. The most recognizable of these groups are known as the Ngagpas of Tibet. For Buddhists of these particular sects and degrees of initiation, their locked hair is not only a symbol of their vows but an embodiment of the particular powers they are sworn to carry.The Dreadlocks Treatise: On Tantric Hairstyles in Tibetan Buddhism. 1.4.15 of the Hevajra Tantra states that the practitioner of particular ceremonies \"should arrange his piled up hair\" as part of the ceremonial protocol.Snellgrove, David. The Hevajra Tantra: A Critical Study. vol 1. Oxford University Press. 1959. === Hinduism === The practice of Jaṭā (dreadlocks) is practiced in modern day Hinduism, most notably by Sadhus who follow Śiva.

Rastafari hold that Haile Selassie is a direct descendant of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, through their son Menelik I. Their dreadlocks were inspired by the Nazarites of the Bible.Pool, H. (2003, August 22). Dare to dread. Retrieved from https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2003/aug/23/features.weekend Haile Selassie was crowned Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930. Many Jamaican Rastafarians claimed that Selassie's coronation was evidence that he was the black messiah that they believed was prophesied in the Book of Revelation. Some street preachers such as Leonard Howell, Archibald Dunkley, Robert Hinds, and Joseph Hibbert began to claim that \"Haile Selassie was the returned Jesus\".Barrett, Leonard E. (1988). The Rastafarians. Beacon Press. . During the Great Depression in the 1930s, the Rastafari message spread from Kingston to the rest of Jamaica, especially among poor communities.

When reggae music, which espoused Rastafarian ideals, gained popularity and mainstream acceptance in the 1970s, thanks to Bob Marley's music and cultural influence, dreadlocks (often called \"dreads\") became a notable fashion statement worldwide, and have been worn by prominent authors, actors, athletes and rappers. === In sports === Dreadlocks have become a popular hairstyle among professional athletes.
