He began his professional career at age 12 after receiving a guitar as a Christmas present. During a 2018 interview, Moore stated, \"I got my first guitar for Christmas when I was like 12, basically just because I saw a picture of a guitar in a catalog, a JCPenney's catalog. I thought, 'Hey that looks pretty cool. I want that.' That was my motivation at the time, and I got it for Christmas, and really didn't bother with it a whole lot. Then, I started taking lessons for the next year. Then I really started to get obsessed with it.\" During that same interview, Moore was asked who his earliest teachers were, and he stated, \"The first teacher was Mary Biddle, and I studied for a year with her, just some basic lessons at the local music shop. After about a year, I had advanced, and she referred me to another guy named Nick Bucci, who was a great player in my local area. He was studying jazz guitar with Pat Martino, and was also a rock guy, and he just taught me a lot of stuff; theory, and exercises, and all different kinds of stuff to make me become a better player and musician.\" Moore played clubs and bars until Shrapnel executive Mike Varney discovered him via a demo and biography that Moore submitted to the Spotlight column, which Varney headed for Guitar Player. His connection to Varney led to an opportunity to appear in a Pepsi commercial in 1985 (only Vinnie's hands appeared in the commercial as his guitar playing is heard). Following this, Moore recorded his first solo album, Mind's Eye (1986), released on Shrapnel Records and featuring Tony MacAlpine on keyboards. The album received several awards from guitar magazines and sold over 100,000 copies. Moore played lead guitar with the heavy metal band Vicious Rumors on their debut album, Soldiers of the Night (1985). The album featured Moore's solo-song \"Invader\", which was in the style of Van Halen's \"Eruption\". The shred guitar craze of the late 1980s led to more releases for Shrapnel. Moore also began performing with other hard rock and heavy metal bands. Moore joined Alice Cooper's band for a tour and then appeared on the Hey Stoopid (1991) album. Moore released two instructional videos on guitar playing. Moore has been the lead guitarist for UFO since June 2003, releasing his first studio album with them You Are Here the following year. This has been followed by The Monkey Puzzle (2006), The Visitor (2009), Seven Deadly (2012) and A Conspiracy of Stars (2015). On August 5, 2013, Moore came on stage to perform live with Peter Frampton on Frampton's Guitar Circus concert at Musikfest in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Moore played guitar on Red Zone Rider's debut album Red Zone Rider released on September 16, 2014. ==Equipment== Moore is currently endorsed by Dean guitars, with whom he has several signature models. Prior to his endorsement with Dean, he used guitars made by various other brands over the years including Ibanez and Fender, most notably the Talon model that was manufactured by Heartfield, one of Fender's sub brands. Moore also currently uses ENGL amplifiers and DiMarzio pickups. ==Discography== ===Discography=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Album details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\" | Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Sales |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" |US |- ! scope=\"row\" | Mind's Eye | * Released: 1986 * Label: Shrapnel Records * Formats: CD, CS, LP, DL || – | * US: 6,719+ |- ! scope=\"row\" | Time Odyssey | * Released: 1988 * Label: Shrapnel Records * Formats: CD, LP || 147 | * US: 12,101+ |- ! scope=\"row\" | Meltdown | * Released: 1991 * Label: Relativity * Formats: CD, CS, LP || – | * US: 49,661+ |- ! scope=\"row\" | Out of Nowhere | * Released: April 16, 1996 * Label: Mayhem * Formats: CD || – | * US: 6,777+ |- ! scope=\"row\" | The Maze | * Released: March 23, 1999 * Label: Shrapnel Records * Formats: CD, DL || – | * US: 5,852+ |- ! scope=\"row\" | Defying Gravity | * Released: July 10, 2001 * Label: Shrapnel Records * Formats: CD, DL || – | |- ! scope=\"row\" | To the Core | * Released: May 26, 2009 * Label: Mascot * Formats: CD, DL || – | |- ! scope=\"row\" | Aerial Visions | * Released: October 23, 2015 * Label: Mind's Eye Music * Formats: Digital, CD || – | |- ! scope=\"row\" | Soul Shifter | * Released: October 4, 2019 * Label: Mind's Eye Music * Formats: Digital, CD || – | |- | colspan=\"10\" style=\"font- size:90%\" | \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory. |} ===Compilation albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" | Album details |- |- ! scope=\"row\" | Collection: The Shrapnel Years | * Released: March 14, 2006 * Label: Shrapnel Records * Formats: CD, DL |} ===Live albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" | Album details |- ! scope=\"row\" | Live! | * Released: January 25, 2000 * Label: Shrapnel Records * Formats: CD, DL |} ===Instructional videos=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" | Album details |- ! scope=\"row\" |Advanced Lead Guitar Techniques | * Released: 1987 * Label: Hot Licks * Formats: VHS |- ! scope=\"row\" |Speed, Accuracy, & Articulation | * Released: 1989 * Label: Hot Licks * Formats: VHS |} ===Other appearances=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Notes |- ! scope=\"row\" |Vicious Rumors – Soldiers of the Night |1985 |band member |- ! scope=\"row\" |Alice Cooper – Hey Stoopid |1991 |band member |- ! scope=\"row\" |UFO – You Are Here |2004 |band member |- ! scope=\"row\" |Jordan Rudess – Rhythm of Time |2004 |guest |- ! scope=\"row\" |UFO – Showtime |2005 |band member |- ! scope=\"row\" |UFO – The Monkey Puzzle |2006 |band member |- ! scope=\"row\" |Destruction – D.E.V.O.L.U.T.I.O.N. |2008 |guest |- ! scope=\"row\" |Michael Angelo Batio – Hands Without Shadows 2 – Voices |2009 |guest |- ! scope=\"row\" |UFO – The Visitor |2009 |band member |- ! scope=\"row\" |Glen Drover – Metalusion |2011 |guest |- ! scope=\"row\" |UFO – Seven Deadly |2012 |band member |- ! scope=\"row\" |Red Zone Rider – Red Zone Rider |2014 |band member |- ! scope=\"row\" |UFO – A Conspiracy of Stars |2015 |band member |} ==References== ==External links== * Vinnie Moore's Official Web Site Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:Lead guitarists Category:American heavy metal guitarists Category:People from New Castle, Delaware Category:UFO (band) members Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:Shrapnel Records artists",
