 "text": "\"Volvo-Driving Soccer Mom\" is a song by the alternative rock band Everclear, from their album Slow Motion Daydream (2003). The song was performed by Everclear lead singer Art Alexakis during his solo tour and was made the first single off Slow Motion Daydream. ==Content== The song is about girls who use drugs and are sexually promiscuous in high school and college, but later grow up to be more conservative, suburban housewives when they decide it will be to their advantage. The lyrics allude to having a threesome and being busted for possession in the earlier part of the song, and describes the subjects' lives later on as \"blonde, bland, middle-class Republican lives\". In an October 2003 interview with Songfacts, Alexakis explained the inspiration for \"Volvo Driving Soccer Mom\": ==Music video== The video for the song features the story of a blonde wild child and former stripper who grows up to become a Volvo- driving soccer mom just like the song describes. In the video, scenes from her \"checkered\" past are intercut with scenes from her present life as a housewife to highlight the differences between the two. The video also features scenes of Everclear performing the song at a house party. ==Australian CD single== #\"Volvo Driving Soccer Mom\" #\"Your New Disease\" #\"Happy\" ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Chart (2003) !Peak position |- |} ==See also== *Volvo *Soccer mom ==References== Category:Everclear (band) songs Category:2003 singles Category:2002 songs Category:Music videos directed by Francis Lawrence Category:Songs written by Art Alexakis Category:Songs written by Greg Eklund Category:Songs written by Craig Montoya Category:Volvo Cars",
