He is a bestselling author of young adult and children's fiction. ==Biography== McFadden was born in New York City in 1955, but grew up in California. He attended college briefly before dropping out and working various jobs such as house painting and computer programming. He initially tried his hand at writing science fiction and adult mystery, but later began writing teen thrillers due to an editor's suggestion. McFadden's first novel, Slumber Party, was initially written as a supernatural thriller containing a character with pyrokinesis, which he later removed upon the request of his editor. The book was then re- written as a mystery thriller about a group of teenagers who run into bizarre and violent events during a ski weekend. His editor sold the book to Scholastic Press, which released it in 1985. McFadden's next novel, Weekend, was also published through Scholastic. He would go on to publish one more novel through Scholastic, the 1986 Chain Letter, before moving to Simon and Schuster. McFadden continued to write several young adult novels and later branched into juvenile novels under the Spooksville series title, as well as several adult novels such as his 1990 book, Sati. Spooksville was adapted into a television series in 2013 on the Hub network (now known as Discovery Family). On November 25, 1996, his book Fall into Darkness was adapted into a television movie of the same name, produced by his company Christopher Pike Productions. == Adaptations == On November 25, 1996, his book Fall into Darkness was adapted into a television movie of the same name, produced by his company Christopher Pike Productions.
