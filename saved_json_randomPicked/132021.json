The municipal seat is located in the city of Borgholm. Notable historic sites in this municipality are Borgholm Castle and Halltorps Estate. The local government reform in the 1970s saw the creation of two municipalities on the island of Öland. Borgholm Municipality is the northern of the two and consists of sixteen original (pre-1952) entities. The southern half of the island is made up of Mörbylånga Municipality. ==Localities== There are 5 urban areas (also called Tätort or localities) in Borgholm Municipality. In the table the localities are listed according to the size of the population as of December 31, 2005. The municipal seat is in bold characters. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! # !! Locality !!
