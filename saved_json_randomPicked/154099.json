 "text": "Kim Jong-il (; ; ; born Yuri Irsenovich Kim; 16 February 1941 – 17 December 2011) was a North Korean politician who was the second supreme leader of North Korea from 1994 to 2011. He led North Korea from the 1994 death of his father Kim Il-sung, the first Supreme Leader, until his own death in 2011, when he was succeeded by his son, Kim Jong-un. In the early 1980s, Kim had become the heir apparent for the leadership of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and assumed important posts in the party and army organs. Kim succeeded his father and DPRK founder Kim Il-sung, following the elder Kim's death in 1994. Kim was the General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), WPK Presidium, Chairman of the National Defence Commission (NDC) of North Korea and the Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army (KPA), the fourth- largest standing army in the world. Kim ruled North Korea as a repressive and totalitarian dictatorship. Kim assumed leadership during a period of catastrophic economic crisis amidst the dissolution of the Soviet Union, on which it was heavily dependent for trade in food and other supplies, which brought a famine. While the famine had ended by the late 1990s, food scarcity continued to be a problem throughout his tenure. Kim strengthened the role of the military by his Songun (\"military-first\") policies, making the army the central organizer of civil society. Kim's rule also saw tentative economic reforms, including the opening of the Kaesong Industrial Park in 2003. In April 2009, North Korea's constitution was amended to refer to him and his successors as the \"supreme leader of the DPRK\". The most common colloquial title given to Kim was \"Dear Leader\" to distinguish him from his father Kim Il-sung, the \"Great Leader\". Following Kim's failure to appear at important public events in 2008, foreign observers assumed that Kim had either fallen seriously ill or died. On 19 December 2011, the North Korean government announced that he had died two days earlier, whereupon his third son, Kim Jong-un, was promoted to a senior position in the ruling WPK and succeeded him. After his death, Kim was designated the \"Eternal General Secretary\" of the WPK and the \"Eternal Chairman of the National Defence Commission\", in keeping with the tradition of establishing eternal posts for the dead members of the Kim family. == Early life == === Birth === Soviet records show that Kim was born Yuri Irsenovich Kim (). In literature, it is assumed that he was born in 1941 in either the camp of Vyatskoye, near Khabarovsk, or camp Voroshilov near Nikolsk. According to Lim Jae-cheon, Kim cannot have been born in Vyatskoye as Kim Il-sung's war records show that he arrived at Vyatskoye only in July 1942 and had been living in Voroshilov before, thus Kim Jong-il is generally agreed to have been born in Voroshilov. Kim's mother, Kim Jong-suk, was Kim Il-sung's first wife. Inside his family, he was nicknamed \"Yura\", while his younger brother Kim Man-il (born Alexander Irsenovich Kim) was nicknamed \"Shura\". Kim's official biography states he was born in a secret military camp on Paektu Mountain (; Baekdusan Miryeong Gohyang jip) in Chōsen on 16 February 1942. According to one comrade of Kim's mother, Lee Min, word of Kim's birth first reached an army camp in Vyatskoye via radio and that both Kim and his mother did not return there until the following year. Reports indicate that his mother died in childbirth in 1949. In 1945, Kim was four years old when World War II ended and Korea regained independence from Japan. His father returned to Pyongyang that September, and in late November Kim returned to Korea via a Soviet ship, landing at Sonbong. The family moved into a former Japanese officer's mansion in Pyongyang, with a garden and pool. Kim's brother drowned there in 1948. === Education === According to his official biography, Kim completed the course of general education between September 1950 and August 1960. He attended Primary School No. 4 and Middle School No. 1 (Namsan Higher Middle School) in Pyongyang. This is contested by foreign academics, who believe he is more likely to have received his early education in the People's Republic of China as a precaution to ensure his safety during the Korean War.Martin, Bradley K. (2004). Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader, New York: St. Martin's Press. . Throughout his schooling, Kim was involved in politics. He was active in the Korean Children's Union and the Democratic Youth League of North Korea (DYL), taking part in study groups of Marxist political theory and other literature. In September 1957, he became vice-chairman of his middle school's DYL branch (the chairman had to be a teacher). He pursued a programme of anti- factionalism and attempted to encourage greater ideological education among his classmates. Kim is also said to have received English language education in Malta in the early 1970s on his infrequent holidays there as a guest of Prime Minister Dom Mintoff. The elder Kim had meanwhile remarried and had another son, Kim Pyong-il. Since 1988, Kim Pyong-il has served in a series of North Korean embassies in Europe and was the North Korean ambassador to Poland. Foreign commentators suspect that Kim Pyong-il was sent to these distant posts by his father in order to avoid a power struggle between his two sons. == The 6th Party Congress and heir apparent (1980–1994) == By the time of the Sixth Party Congress in October 1980, Kim's control of the Party operation was complete. He was given senior posts in the Presidium, the Military Commission and the party Secretariat. According to his official biography, the WPK Central Committee had already anointed him successor to Kim Il-sung in February 1974. When he was made a member of the Seventh Supreme People's Assembly in February 1982, international observers deemed him the heir apparent of North Korea. Prior to 1980, he had no public profile and was referred to only as the \"Party Centre\". At this time Kim assumed the title \"Dear Leader\" (),\"North Korea's dear leader less dear\", Fairfax Digital, 19 November 2004. the government began building a personality cult around him patterned after that of his father, the \"Great Leader\". Kim was regularly hailed by the media as the \"fearless leader\" and \"the great successor to the revolutionary cause\". He emerged as the most powerful figure behind his father in North Korea. On 24 December 1991, Kim was also named Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army. Defence Minister Oh Jin-wu, one of Kim Il-sung's most loyal subordinates, engineered Kim's acceptance by the Army as the next leader of North Korea, despite his lack of military service. The only other possible leadership candidate, Prime Minister Kim Il (no relation), was removed from his posts in 1976. In 1992, Kim Il-sung publicly stated that his son was in charge of all internal affairs in the Democratic People's Republic. In 1992, radio broadcasts started referring to him as the \"Dear Father\", instead of the \"Dear Leader\", suggesting a promotion. His 50th birthday in February was the occasion for massive celebrations, exceeded only by those for the 80th birthday of Kim Il-sung himself on 15 April that same year. According to defector Hwang Jang-yop, the North Korean government system became even more centralized and autocratic during the 1980s and 1990s under Kim than it had been under his father. In one example explained by Hwang, although Kim Il- sung required his ministers to be loyal to him, he nonetheless and frequently sought their advice during decision-making. In contrast, Kim Jong-il demanded absolute obedience and agreement from his ministers and party officials with no advice or compromise, and he viewed any slight deviation from his thinking as a sign of disloyalty. According to Hwang, Kim Jong-il personally directed even minor details of state affairs, such as the size of houses for party secretaries and the delivery of gifts to his subordinates. thumb|Idealized portrait of Kim Jong-il By the 1980s, North Korea began to experience severe economic stagnation. Kim Il-sung's policy of Juche (self-reliance) cut the country off from almost all external trade, even with its traditional partners, the Soviet Union and China. South Korea accused Kim of ordering the 1983 bombing in Rangoon, Burma which killed 17 visiting South Korean officials, including four cabinet members, and another in 1987 which killed all 115 onboard Korean Air Flight 858.\"North Korea: Nuclear Standoff\", The Online NewsHour, PBS, 19 October 2006. A North Korean agent, Kim Hyon Hui, confessed to planting a bomb in the case of the second, saying the operation was ordered by Kim personally.Fake ashes, very real North Korean sanctions, Asia Times Online, 16 December 2004. In 1992, Kim made his first public speech during a military parade for the KPA's 60th anniversary and said: \"Glory to the officers and soldiers of the heroic Korean People's Army!\". These words were followed by a loud applause by the crowd at Pyongyang's Kim Il-sung Square where the parade was held. Kim was named Chairman of the National Defence Commission on 9 April 1993, making him day-to-day commander of the armed forces. == Leader of North Korea == On 8 July 1994, Kim Il-sung died at the age of 82 from a heart attack. Kim Jong-il had been his father's designated successor as early as 1974, named commander-in-chief in 1991, and became Supreme Leader upon his father's death. He officially took over his father's old post as General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea on 8 October 1997. In 1998, he was re-elected as chairman of the National Defence Commission, and a constitutional amendment declared that post to be \"the highest post of the state.\" Also in 1998, the Supreme People's Assembly wrote the president's post out of the constitution and designated Kim Il-sung as the country's \"Eternal President\" in order to honor his memory forever. Officially, Kim was part of a triumvirate heading the executive branch of the North Korean government along with Premier Choe Yong-rim and parliament chairman Kim Yong-nam (no relation). Kim commanded the armed forces, Choe Yong-rim headed the government and handled domestic affairs and Kim Yong-nam handled foreign relations. However, in practice, Kim, like his father before him, exercised absolute control over the government and the country. Although not required to stand for popular election to his key offices, he was unanimously elected to the Supreme People's Assembly every five years, representing a military constituency, due to his concurrent capacities as supreme commander of the KPA and chairman of the NDC. === Economic policies === Kim had a \"reputation for being almost comically incompetent in matters of economic management\". The economy of North Korea struggled throughout the 1990s, primarily due to mismanagement. In addition, North Korea experienced severe floods in the mid-1990s, exacerbated by poor land management. This, compounded with the fact that only 18% of North Korea is arable land\"North Korea Agriculture\", Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress. Retrieved 11 March 2007. and the country's inability to import the goods necessary to sustain industry,\"Other Industry – North Korean Targets\" Federation of American Scientists, 15 June 2000. led to a severe famine and left North Korea economically devastated. Faced with a country in decay, Kim adopted a \"Military-First\" policy to strengthen the country and reinforce the regime.Homer T. Hodge. , Parameters, U.S. Army War College Quarterly, 2003. On the national scale, the Japanese Foreign Ministry acknowledges that this has resulted in a positive growth rate for the country since 1996, with the implementation of \"landmark socialist-type market economic practices\" in 2002, keeping the North afloat despite a continued dependency on foreign aid for food.\"Kim's military-first policy a silver bullet\", Asia Times Online, 4 January 2007. In the wake of the devastation of the 1990s, the government began formally approving some activity of small-scale bartering and trade. As observed by Daniel Sneider, associate director for research at the Stanford University Asia–Pacific Research Center, this flirtation with capitalism was \"fairly limited, butespecially compared to the pastthere are now remarkable markets that create the semblance of a free market system\".\"North Korea's Capitalist Experiment\" , Council on Foreign Relations, 8 June 2006. In 2002, Kim declared that \"money should be capable of measuring the worth of all commodities.\"\"On North Korea's streets, pink and tangerine buses\", The Christian Science Monitor, 2 June 2005. These gestures toward economic reform mirror similar actions taken by China's Deng Xiaoping in the late 1980s and early 90s. During a rare visit in 2006, Kim expressed admiration for China's rapid economic progress.\"Inside North Korea: A Joint U.S.–Chinese Dialogue\", United States Institute of Peace, January 2007. An unsuccessful devaluation of the North Korean won in 2009, initiated or approved by Kim personally, caused brief economic chaos and uncovered the vulnerability of the country's societal fabric in the face of crisis. === Foreign relations === Kim was known as a skilled and manipulative diplomat. In 1998, South Korean President Kim Dae- jung implemented the \"Sunshine Policy\" to improve North-South relations and to allow South Korean companies to start projects in the North. Kim announced plans to import and develop new technologies to develop North Korea's fledgling software industry. As a result of the new policy, the Kaesong Industrial Park was constructed in 2003 just north of the de-militarized zone.\"Asan, KOLAND Permitted to Develop Kaesong Complex\", The Korea Times, 23 April 2004. In 1994, North Korea and the United States signed an Agreed Framework which was designed to freeze and eventually dismantle the North's nuclear weapons program in exchange for aid in producing two power-generating nuclear reactors and the assurance that it would not be invaded again. In 2000, after a meeting with Madeleine Albright, he agreed to a moratorium on missile construction.\"History of the 'Agreed Framework' and how it was broken\", About: U.S. Gov Info/Resources, 12 March 2007.\"Atoms for Pyongyang\", Foreign Affairs, 14 June 2017. In 2002, Kim's government admitted to having produced nuclear weapons since the 1994 agreement. Kim's regime argued the secret production was necessary for security purposesciting the presence of United States-owned nuclear weapons in South Korea and the new tensions with the United States under President George W. Bush.\"Motivation Behind North Korea's Nuclear Confession\", GLOCOM Platform, 28 October 2002. On 9 October 2006, North Korea's Korean Central News Agency announced that it had successfully conducted an underground nuclear test. === Cult of personality === thumb|A North Korean voting booth containing portraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il under the national flag (below the portraits is the ballot box) Kim was the focus of an elaborate personality cult inherited from his father and founder of the DPRK, Kim Il-sung. Kim Jong-il was often the centre of attention throughout ordinary life in the DPRK. On his 60th birthday (based on his official date of birth), mass celebrations occurred throughout the country on the occasion of his Hwangap. In 2010, the North Korean media reported that Kim's distinctive clothing had set worldwide fashion trends. The prevailing point of view is that the people's adherence to Kim's cult of personality was solely out of respect for Kim Il-sung or out of fear of punishment for failure to pay homage. Media and government sources from outside North Korea generally support this view,Richard Lloyd Parry. \"'Dear Leader' clings to power while his people pay the price\", The Times. 10 October 2006. Retrieved 18 December 2007.Compiled by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. \"Country Reports on Human Rights Practices\" United States Department of State. 25 February 2004. Retrieved 18 December 2007. while North Korean government sources aver that it was genuine hero worship. The song \"No Motherland Without You\", sung by the KPA State Merited Choir, was created especially for Kim in 1992 and is frequently broadcast on the radio and from loudspeakers on the streets of Pyongyang. === Human rights record === According to a 2004 Human Rights Watch report, the North Korean government under Kim was \"among the world's most repressive governments\", having up to 200,000 political prisoners according to U.S. and South Korean officials, with no freedom of the press or religion, political opposition or equal education: \"Virtually every aspect of political, social, and economic life is controlled by the government.\" Kim's government was accused of \"crimes against humanity\" for its alleged culpability in creating and prolonging the 1990s famine. Human Rights Watch characterized him as a dictator and accused him of human rights violations. Amnesty International condemned him for leaving 'millions of North Koreans mired in poverty' and detaining hundreds of thousands of people in prison camps. Kim Jong-il claimed that the barometer for distinguishing whether a person can be deemed a member of North Korean society and hence entitled to rights 'lies not on the grounds of his social class but on the grounds of his ideology'. == Health and rumors of waning power == === 2008 reports === In an August 2008 issue of the Japanese newsweekly Shūkan Gendai, Waseda University professor Toshimitsu Shigemura, an authority on the Korean Peninsula, claimed that Kim died of diabetes in late 2003 and had been replaced in public appearances by one or more stand-ins previously employed to protect him from assassination attempts.\"N Korea's Kim died in 2003; replaced by lookalike, says Waseda professor\", Japan Today, 24 August 2008. In a subsequent best- selling book, The True Character of Kim Jong-il, Shigemura cited apparently unnamed people close to Kim's family along with Japanese and South Korean intelligence sources, claiming they confirmed Kim's diabetes took a turn for the worse early in 2000 and from then until his supposed death three and a half years later he was using a wheelchair. Shigemura moreover claimed a voiceprint analysis of Kim speaking in 2004 did not match a known earlier recording. It was also noted that Kim did not appear in public for the Olympic torch relay in Pyongyang on 28 April 2008. The question had reportedly \"baffled foreign intelligence agencies for years\".Sheridan, Michael, \"North Korea 'uses doubles to hide death of Kim'\", Sunday Times, 7 September 2008. Retrieved 8 September 2008. On 9 September 2008, various sources reported that after he did not show up that day for a military parade celebrating North Korea's 60th anniversary, United States intelligence agencies believed Kim might be \"gravely ill\" after having suffered a stroke. He had last been seen in public a month earlier. A former CIA official said earlier reports of a health crisis were likely accurate. North Korean media remained silent on the issue. An Associated Press report said analysts believed Kim had been supporting moderates in the foreign ministry, while North Korea's powerful military was against so-called \"Six-Party\" negotiations with China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and the United States aimed towards ridding North Korea of nuclear weapons. Some United States officials noted that soon after rumours about Kim's health were publicized a month before, North Korea had taken a \"tougher line in nuclear negotiations\". In late August North Korea's official news agency reported the government would \"consider soon a step to restore the nuclear facilities in Nyongbyon to their original state as strongly requested by its relevant institutions\". Analysts said this meant \"the military may have taken the upper hand and that Kim might no longer be wielding absolute authority\". By 10 September, there were conflicting reports. Unidentified South Korean government officials said Kim had undergone surgery after suffering a minor stroke and had apparently \"intended to attend 9 September event in the afternoon but decided not to because of the aftermath of the surgery\". High-ranking North Korean official Kim Yong-nam said, \"While we wanted to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the country with general secretary Kim Jong-Il, we celebrated on our own\". Song Il-Ho, North Korea's ambassador said, \"We see such reports as not only worthless, but rather as a conspiracy plot\". Seoul's Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported that \"the South Korean embassy in Beijing had received an intelligence report that Kim collapsed on 22 August\". The New York Times reported on 9 September that Kim was \"very ill and most likely suffered a stroke a few weeks ago, but United States intelligence authorities do not think his death is imminent\". The BBC noted that the North Korean government denied these reports, stating that Kim's health problems were \"not serious enough to threaten his life\", although they did confirm that he had suffered a stroke on 15 August. thumb|left|Kim at a meeting during his visit with Dmitry Medvedev in August 2011 Japan's Kyodo News agency reported on 14 September, that \"Kim collapsed on 14 August due to stroke or a cerebral hemorrhage, and that Beijing dispatched five military doctors at the request of Pyongyang. Kim will require a long period of rest and rehabilitation before he fully recovers and has complete command of his limbs again, as with typical stroke victims\". Japan's Mainichi Shimbun claimed Kim had occasionally lost consciousness since April. Japan's Tokyo Shimbun on 15 September, added that Kim was staying at the Bongwha State Guest House. He was apparently conscious \"but he needs some time to recuperate from the recent stroke, with some parts of his hands and feet paralyzed\". It cited Chinese sources which claimed that one cause for the stroke could have been stress brought about by the United States delay to remove North Korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism.. Yahoo! News. 15 September 2008. On 19 October, North Korea reportedly ordered its diplomats to stay near their embassies to await \"an important message\", according to Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun, setting off renewed speculation about the health of the ailing leader. By 29 October 2008, reports stated Kim suffered a serious setback and had been taken back to the hospital. The New York Times reported that Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso, on 28 October 2008, stated in a parliamentary session that Kim had been hospitalized: \"His condition is not so good. However, I don't think he is totally incapable of making decisions\". Aso further said a French neurosurgeon was aboard a plane for Beijing, en route to North Korea. Further, Kim Sung-ho, director of South Korea's National Intelligence Service, told lawmakers in a closed parliamentary session in Seoul that \"Kim appeared to be recovering quickly enough to start performing his daily duties\". The Dong-a Ilbo newspaper reported \"a serious problem\" with Kim's health. Japan's Fuji Television network reported that Kim's eldest son, Kim Jong-nam, traveled to Paris to hire a neurosurgeon for his father, and showed footage where the surgeon boarded flight CA121 bound for Pyongyang from Beijing on 24 October. The French weekly Le Point identified him as Francois-Xavier Roux, neurosurgery director of Paris' Sainte-Anne Hospital, but Roux himself stated he was in Beijing for several days and not North Korea. On 19 December 2011, Roux confirmed that Kim suffered a debilitating stroke in 2008 and was treated by himself and other French doctors at Pyongyang's Red Cross Hospital. Roux said Kim suffered few lasting effects.French doctor confirms Kim had stroke in 2008 (Associated Press via PhilStar), 19 December 2011. On 5 November 2008, the North's Korean Central News Agency published 2 photos showing Kim posing with dozens of Korean People's Army (KPA) soldiers on a visit to military Unit 2200 and sub-unit of Unit 534. Shown with his usual bouffant hairstyle, with his trademark sunglasses and a white winter parka, Kim stood in front of trees with autumn foliage and a red-and-white banner.JPG image JPG image, archived from or The Times questioned the authenticity of at least one of these photos. In November 2008, Japan's TBS TV network reported that Kim had suffered a second stroke in October, which \"affected the movement of his left arm and leg and also his ability to speak\". However, South Korea's intelligence agency rejected this report. In response to the rumors regarding Kim's health and supposed loss of power, in April 2009, North Korea released a video showing Kim visiting factories and other places around the country between November and December 2008. In 2010, documents released by WikiLeaks purportedly attested that Kim suffered from epilepsy. According to The Daily Telegraph, Kim was a chain-smoker. === Successor === Kim's three sons and his brother-in- law, along with O Kuk-ryol, an army general, had been noted as possible successors, but the North Korean government had for a time been wholly silent on this matter. Kim Yong Hyun, a political expert at the Institute for North Korean Studies at Seoul's Dongguk University, said in 2007: \"Even the North Korean establishment would not advocate a continuation of the family dynasty at this point\". Kim's eldest son Kim Jong-nam was earlier believed to be the designated heir but he appeared to have fallen out of favor after being arrested at Narita International Airport near Tokyo in 2001 where he was caught attempting to enter Japan on a fake passport to visit Tokyo Disneyland.\"Japan deports man claiming to be Kim Jong-Nam\", ABC News: The World Today, 4 May 2001 (see Family tree) On 2 June 2009, it was reported that Kim's youngest son, Kim Jong-un, was to be North Korea's next leader. Like his father and grandfather, he has also been given an official sobriquet, The Brilliant Comrade. Prior to his death, it had been reported that Kim was expected to officially designate the son as his successor in 2012. === Re- election as leader === On 9 April 2009, Kim was re-elected as chairman of the National Defence Commission and made an appearance at the Supreme People's Assembly. This was the first time Kim was seen in public since August 2008. He was unanimously re-elected and given a standing ovation. On 28 September 2010, Kim was re-elected as General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea. === 2010 and 2011 foreign visits === Kim reportedly visited the People's Republic of China in May 2010. He entered the country via his personal train on 3 May and stayed in a hotel in Dalian. In May 2010, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Kurt Campbell told South Korean officials that Kim had only three years to live, according to medical information that had been compiled.\"Kim Jong-il 'Has 3 Years to Live'\", Chosun Ilbo, 17 March 2010. Kim travelled to China again in August 2010, this time with his son, fueling speculation at the time that he was ready to hand over power to his son, Kim Jong-un. He returned to China again in May 2011, marking the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance between China and the DPRK. In late August 2011, he traveled by train to the Russian Far East to meet with President Dmitry Medvedev for unspecified talks.Schwirtz, M. \"Kim Il-Jong Visits Russia to Meet with President Medvedev\", The New York Times. 21 August 2011. === Late 2011 === There were speculations that the visits of Kim abroad in 2010 and 2011 were a sign of his improving health and a possible slowdown in succession might follow. After the visit to Russia, Kim appeared in a military parade in Pyongyang on 9 September, accompanied by Kim Jong-un. == Death == thumb|An official portrait of Kim, issued after his death It was reported that Kim had died of a suspected heart attack on 17 December 2011 at 8:30a.m. while travelling by train to an area outside Pyongyang. It was reported in December 2012, however, that he had died \"in a fit of rage\" over construction faults at a crucial power plant project at Huichon in Jagang Province. He was succeeded by his youngest son Kim Jong-un, who was hailed by the Korean Central News Agency as the \"Great Successor\".\"Kim Jong Il's youngest son dubbed 'great successor'\". NBC News. 19 December 2011. According to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), during his death a fierce snowstorm \"paused\" and \"the sky glowed red above the sacred Mount Paektu\" and the ice on a famous lake also cracked so loud that it seemed to \"shake the Heavens and the Earth\". Kim's funeral took place on 28 December in Pyongyang, with a mourning period lasting until the following day. South Korea's military was immediately put on alert after the announcement and its National Security Council convened for an emergency meeting, out of concern that political jockeying in North Korea could destabilise the region. Asian stock markets fell soon after the announcement, due to similar concerns. On 12 January 2012, North Korea called Kim the \"eternal leader\" and announced that his body would be preserved and displayed at Pyongyang's Kumsusan Memorial Palace. Officials also announced plans to install statues, portraits, and \"towers to his immortality\" across the country. His birthday of 16 February was declared \"the greatest auspicious holiday of the nation\" and was named the Day of the Shining Star. In February 2012, on what would have been his 71st birthday, Kim was posthumously made Dae Wonsu (usually translated as Generalissimo, literally Grand Marshal), the nation's top military rank. He had been named Wonsu (Marshal) in 1992 when North Korean founder Kim Il-sung was promoted to Dae Wonsu. Also in February 2012, the North Korean government created the Order of Kim Jong-il in his honor and awarded it to 132 individuals for services in building a \"thriving socialist nation\" and for increasing defense capabilities. == Personal life == === Family === thumb|Kim Jong-il and his father Kim Il-sung There is no official information available about Kim Jong-il's marital history, but he is believed to have been officially married twice and to have had three mistresses.. Time. He had three known sons: Kim Jong-nam, Kim Jong-chul and Kim Jong-un. His two known daughters are Kim Sol-song and Kim Yo-jong. Kim's first wife, Hong Il-chon, was the daughter of a martyr who died during the Korean War. She was handpicked by his father and married to him in 1966. They have a girl called Kim Hye-kyung, who was born in 1968. Soon, they divorced in 1969. Kim's first mistress, Song Hye-rim, was a star of North Korean films. She was already married to another man and with a child when they met.\"North Korean defector says Kim Jong Il stole her life\", Los Angeles Times, 21 December 2011. Kim is reported to have forced her husband to divorce her. This relationship, which started in 1970, was not officially recognized. They had one son, Kim Jong-nam (1971–2017), who was Kim Jong-il's eldest son. Kim kept both the relationship and the child a secret (even from his father) until he ascended to power in 1994., Time Asia, 23 June 2003 (archive). However, after years of estrangement, Song is believed to have died in Moscow in the Central Clinical Hospital in 2002. Kim's official wife, Kim Young-sook, was the daughter of a high-ranking military official. His father Kim Il-Sung handpicked her to marry his son. The two were estranged for some years before Kim's death. Kim had a daughter from this marriage, Kim Sol-song (born 1974). His second mistress, Ko Yong-hui, was a Japanese-born ethnic Korean and a dancer. She had taken over the role of First Lady until her deathreportedly of cancerin 2004. They had two sons, Kim Jong-chul (in 1981) and Kim Jong-un, also \"Jong Woon\" or \"Jong Woong\" (in 1983).\"N. Korea Heir Apparent 'Given More Auspicious Birthday\". The Chosun Ilbo. 11 December 2009. They also had a daughter, Kim Yo-jong, who was about 23 years old in 2012. After Ko's death, Kim lived with Kim Ok, his third mistress, who had served as his personal secretary since the 1980s. She \"virtually act[ed] as North Korea's first lady\" and frequently accompanied Kim on his visits to military bases and in meetings with visiting foreign dignitaries. She traveled with Kim on a secretive trip to China in January 2006, where she was received by Chinese officials as Kim's wife. According to Michael Breen, author of the book Kim Jong Il: North Korea's Dear Leader, the women intimately linked to Kim never acquired any power or influence of consequence. As he explains, their roles were limited to that of romance and domesticity. He had a younger sister, Kim Kyong-hui.

Segal (with the assistance of a South Korean psychiatrist considered an expert on Kim's behavior), concluded that the \"big six\" group of personality disorders shared by dictators Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Saddam Hussein (sadistic, paranoid, antisocial, narcissistic, schizoid and schizotypal) were also shared by Kimcoinciding primarily with the profile of Saddam Hussein.
