The municipality's population density is and its population has decreased by 5.3% over the previous 10-year period. ==General information== The municipality was established on 1 July 1916 when the southern part of Flakstad Municipality was separated to become Moskenes. Initially, Moskenes had a population of 1,306. On 1 January 1964, the municipalities of Flakstad and Moskenes were reunited, this time under the name \"Moskenes\". Prior to the merger, Moskenes had 2,001 residents and the new municipality of Moskenes had 4,068 residents. This new municipality did not last long because on 1 January 1976, Flakstad broke away again to once again form a separate municipality. This left Moskenes with 1,705 residents. ===Name=== The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Moskenes farm (\"Muskenes\" – 1567), since the first Moskenes Church was built there. The first element is probably derived from the word mosk/musk which means \"sea spray\" and the last element is nes which means \"headland\". (See also Moskenstraumen.) ===Coat of arms=== The coat of arms is from modern times; they were granted on 12 September 1986. The arms show a white vortex spiral on a blue background. Vortexes or whirlpools, such as the Moskenstraumen, appear in the channel just south of the island of Moskenesøya when the tide comes in, making it a hazardous channel. ===Churches=== The Church of Norway has one parish (sokn) within the municipality of Moskenes. It is part of the Lofoten prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Sør-Hålogaland. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ style=\"font- size:medium\"|Churches in Moskenes !Parish (Sokn)!!Church Name!!Location of the Church!!Year Built |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Moskenes||Moskenes Church||Moskenes||1819 |- |Reine Church||Reine||1890 |} ==Attractions== Moskenes is among the most scenic municipalities in all Norway, and the picturesque fishing villages of Hamnøy, Reine, Sørvågen, Moskenes, Å, and Tind all have a dramatic backdrop of jagged peaks rising above the Vestfjorden.
