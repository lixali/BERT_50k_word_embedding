It is a suburb of Dallas and a bedroom community in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. Its population was 38,659 at the 2010 census. A small area in the far northern portion of the city extends into neighboring Denton County. ==History== The Coppell area was settled by German and French immigrants in the 1840s. Members of the Peters Colony also settled here in the 1840s. Originally named Gibbs Station, after Barnett Gibbs (one of Texas's first lieutenant governors), the town was renamed in 1892 for George Coppell, a wealthy English financier, who came to the United States in the 1880s, and was reportedly heavily involved with the final construction of the local railroad line. Popular belief is that he was an engineer, but little or no evidence supports that claim. In 1955, the community was incorporated through a ballot measure that passed by a vote of 41 to 1. Spurred by the opening of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW Airport) in 1974, the city was radically transformed from a tiny farming village to a large, upper-middle class suburban community in the 1980s and 1990s. By 2000, almost all of the residentially zoned land in the city was developed, and the population grew to over 35,000. In addition to suburban homes, the city has a growing commercial base of warehouses and transportation centers on the south and west sides of the city, closest in proximity to the airport. ==Geography== Coppell is located at (32.967341, −96.986564).

Its high schools are Coppell High School and the more recently opened New Tech High. Carrollton- Farmers Branch ISD serves easternmost Coppell, south of Sandy Lake Rd. and to the east of Macarthur Blvd., including the Riverchase area, and students matriculate to Barbara Bush Middle School and Ranchview High School in Irving.\"Ranchview High School Attendance Area .\" Carrollton-Farmers Branch Independent School District. Retrieved on July 15, 2016.\"Barbara Bush Middle School Attendance Area .\" Carrollton-Farmers Branch Independent School District. Retrieved on July 14, 2016.

All of the elementary schools in the Coppell Independent School District are rated \"exemplary\" by the Texas Education Agency (in 2008), as are Coppell Middle School North and Coppell Middle School East. Coppell Middle School West, Coppell High School, and the district as a whole are rated \"recognized\". New Tech High received an \"exemplary\" ranking in its first year, the 2008–2009 school year. Riverchase Elementary (in the Carrollton-Farmers Branch Independent School District, but located in Coppell) is rated \"recognized\". Students from that school go on to attend the Barbara Bush Middle School and Ranchview High School in neighboring Valley Ranch. They are rated \"academically acceptable\" and \"recognized\", respectively. The Coppell ISD was ranked as the top music program in the United States by the Music Educators Association in 2000. In August 2001, Coppell voters approved a sales tax increase to provide funding for arts in the school district. The Coppell High School Marching Band won the Texas 4A UIL championship in 1999 and finished third in 5A in 2009.

NT Fuze produces quality content not only for New Tech and Coppell ISD, but also for local businesses and organizations. ==Transportation== Coppell is next to the northeast corner of DFW Airport. No freeways go directly through the city, but the entire perimeter is served by SH121 and the Sam Rayburn Tollway (west and north), Interstate 635 (south), and the President George Bush Turnpike and Interstate 35E (east). Coppell has no public transportation; it was a charter member of Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART), but voters elected to withdraw from DART in 1989. This election remains controversial today, as the city had a much smaller population in the 1980s, and the lack of membership in DART likely prevents the city from participating in the planned Silver Line commuter rail system. Since Coppell borders DART member cities Carrollton, Dallas, and Irving, it can rejoin at a later date if it wishes, provided that it can assess the mandatory 1% sales tax. The future Cypress Waters station in Coppell is expected to be served by the Silver Line. == Notable people == * Ashley Cain, two-time U.S. figure skating pairs champion * Kim Chung-ha, Korean solo artist, former member of K-pop girl group I.O.I * Kelli Finglass, director of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders * Corey Kluber, two-time Cy Young Award winner, pitcher for the Tampa Bay Rays, former pitcher for the New York Yankees * Bennett Ratliff, member of the Texas House of Representatives from Coppell (2013-2015) * Keri Russell, television and film actress * Chiaka Ogbogu, professional volleyball player, gold medalist in women's indoor volleyball at the 2020 Summer Olympics * Solomon Thomas, defensive tackle for the Las Vegas Raiders * Connor Williams, offensive lineman for the Dallas Cowboys ==References== ==External links== * [Coppell Historical Society website http://www.coppellhistoricalsociety.org/] * [City of Coppell – History of Coppell website http://www.coppelltx.gov/about-coppell/history-of-coppell] * Coppell Citizens Advocate * Dallas Morning News * Coppell Student Media Category:Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex Category:Cities in Texas Category:Cities in Dallas County, Texas Category:Cities in Denton County, Texas Category:Populated places established in 1955 Category:1955 establishments in Texas",
