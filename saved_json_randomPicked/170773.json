 "text": "Pablo Honey is the debut album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 22 February 1993 in the UK by Parlophone and on 20 April in the US by Capitol Records. It was produced by Sean Slade, Paul Q. Kolderie and Radiohead's co- manager Chris Hufford. Radiohead formed at Abingdon School, an independent school for boys in Abingdon, England. They signed a recording contract with EMI in 1991 and released their debut release, the Drill EP, in 1992. Pablo Honey was recorded in three weeks at Chipping Norton Recording Studios in Oxfordshire from September to November 1992. The recording was difficult, with Radiohead's lack of studio experience creating problems. Three singles were released: \"Creep\", \"Anyone Can Play Guitar\" and \"Stop Whispering\". Pablo Honey reached number 22 in the UK Albums Chart. It received generally favourable reviews, but some found it underdeveloped or derivative. Though it failed to make an impact on release, the debut single, \"Creep\", gradually achieved international radio play, and reached number seven on the UK Singles Chart when it was reissued in 1993. Radiohead embarked on an aggressive promotional tour in the US supporting Belly and PJ Harvey, followed by a European tour supporting James. In May 1995, a live video featuring performances of many Pablo Honey songs, Live at the Astoria (1995), was released on VHS. Pablo Honey was certified gold in the UK in 1994 and triple platinum in 2013. In the US, it was certified platinum in 1995. It is less acclaimed than Radiohead's later work, though some retrospective reviews have been positive. \"Creep\" remains Radiohead's most successful single. ==Background== The members of Radiohead met while attending Abingdon School, an independent school for boys in Abingdon, Oxforshire. In 1985, they formed , the name referring to their usual rehearsal day in the school's music room. They recorded demos including the Manic Hedgehog tape, which featured versions of the future Pablo Honey tracks \"You\", \"I Can't\" and \"Thinking About You\". In late 1991, Radiohead signed a six-album recording contract with EMI and changed their name at EMI's request; \"Radiohead\" was taken from the song \"Radio Head\" on the Talking Heads album True Stories (1986). Radiohead's debut release, the Drill EP, was produced by their co-manager, Chris Hufford, in Courtyard Studios. Hufford said this was a mistake, as it created a conflict of interest and generated friction in the studio. Drill was released in 1992 and reached number 101 on the UK Singles Chart; it received little attention, and the Guardian later described it as an \"inauspicious start\". Around this time, the American producers Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade, who had worked with bands including the Pixies and Dinosaur Jr, were in the UK looking for work. EMI A&R; director Nick Gatfield gave them a selection of acts to consider; they agreed to produce Radiohead after he played them \"Stop Whispering\". They were initially hired to produce two songs that EMI was considering for Radiohead's debut single, \"Inside My Head\" and \"Lurgee\". Steve Albini, another producer who had worked with the Pixies, was also considered, but EMI felt he was too risky; he had not yet worked with major acts such as Nirvana. Kolderie was more impressed by Radiohead’s managers than the band, calling them \"crafty mothers ... I don't think I've ever met two guys who had more of a plan.\" As it was difficult for major labels such as EMI to promote bands in the UK, where independent labels dominated the indie charts, Radiohead's managers planned to have Radiohead use American producers and tour aggressively in America, then return to build a following in the UK. == Recording == Radiohead recorded Pablo Honey at Chipping Norton Studios in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire. The sessions did not proceed well; Kolderie described Radiohead as \"desperately inexperienced\", and neither they nor the producers liked the choice of songs for the single. Kolderie said: \"'Inside My Head' was not very melodic, didn't have any of the stuff we thought the others had, so we were rather disappointed.\" Hufford described the results as \"overblown bombastic rock\". During rehearsals, Radiohead played another song, \"Creep\", which impressed the producers. At Kolderie's suggestion, they recorded a take, after which everyone in the studio burst into applause. EMI were persuaded to make \"Creep\" Radiohead's debut single. According to Kolderie, \"Everyone [at EMI] who heard Creep just started going insane,\" and he and Slade were hired to produce the entire album. Pablo Honey was recorded in three weeks. Kolderie described it as a struggle, and said: \"It was their first record and they wanted to be the Beatles, and the mix had to have no reverb, and they had all the ideas they'd ever come up with in 20 years of listening to records.\" He cited Radiohead's songwriting and Yorke's vocals as strengths, but said they had not yet learned to focus on finishing work or play tightly together. For the introduction to \"Anyone Can Play Guitar\", Kolderie had everyone in the studio, including the cook, create sounds on guitar. \"The idea was to live up to the title: anyone can play guitar,\" he said. Jonny Greenwood used a paintbrush for his part. Radiohead did not like the version of \"Lurgee\" they recorded with Kolderie and Slade, and used an earlier version, recorded with Hufford at Courtyard, for the album. Guitarist Ed O'Brien later described the album as \"a collection of our greatest hits as an unsigned band\". He felt it was a \"hedonistic\" album that \"you might put on in an open-top car on a Saturday night going to a party\". The album title comes from a prank call sketch by the Jerky Boys in which the caller poses as the victim's mother and says: \"Pablo, honey? Please come to Florida.\" Yorke said it was appropriate as the band were \"mothers' boys\". A sample of the sketch appears during the guitar solo on \"How Do You\". Kolderie said Pablo Honey was \"not cheap\", and estimated that it had cost more than £100,000 to record. == Release and promotion == \"Creep\" was released as the lead Pablo Honey single on 21 September 1992.Randall, p. 84-85 It initially received little airplay and sold around 6,000 copies, reaching number 78 in the UK Singles Chart. The singles \"Anyone Can Play Guitar\" and \"Stop Whispering\", and the non-album single \"Pop Is Dead\", were also unsuccessful. Radiohead rerecorded \"Stop Whispering\" for the US single as they were not happy with the album version; O'Brien said the new version was \"more atmospheric\", like a Joy Division record. In late 1992, Radiohead toured the UK as the support act for Kingmaker and performed at the UK EMI conference in September. They impressed EMI promoter Carol Baxter, who said: \"This funny little band came on and they obviously had something. This was a hideous record company do but Thom gave it everything.\" That Christmas, NME published a review of a Radiohead performance that dismissed them as \"a pitiful, lily- livered excuse for a rock 'n' roll group\". Pablo Honey was released in February 1993 and received little press; it reached number 22 in the UK Albums Chart. However, \"Creep\" became a hit in Israel, where it was played frequently by influential radio DJ Yoav Kutner. In March, Radiohead were invited to Tel Aviv for their first overseas show. Around the same time, \"Creep\" began receiving airplay on US radio stations and rose to number two on the US Modern Rock chart. By the time Radiohead began their first North American tour in June 1993, the music video for \"Creep\" was in heavy rotation on MTV. The single reached number 34 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and reached number seven on the UK Singles Chart when EMI rereleased it in September 1993. That month, Radiohead performed \"Creep\" on the American talk show Late Night with Conan O'Brien as the show's first musical guests, and on the British music programme Top of the Pops.Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Brit Pop. 2003. Bonus interviews. EMI's American arm Capitol wanted to continue promoting Pablo Honey and build on the momentum. Radiohead declined an offer to tour the US in support of Duran Duran; their managers felt they could earn more credibility by supporting Belly. They also opened for PJ Harvey in New York City and Los Angeles. The band struggled with the tour; Yorke disliked dealing with American music journalists and had tired of the songs. Radiohead appeared in promotional material they later regretted, such as fashion shoots for Iceberg jeans and the magazine Interview. According to Radiohead's agent, the promotional work triggered \"a lot of soul-searching about why they were in a group at all\". Jonny Greenwood said they \"spent a year being jukeboxes ... We felt in a creative stasis because we couldn't release anything new.\" The American tour was followed by a tour of Europe supporting James. Kolderie credited Radiohead's Pablo Honey tours for \"turning them into a tight band\". Following the tour, Radiohead cancelled an appearance at Reading Festival after Yorke became ill; he told NME, \"Physically I'm completely fucked and mentally I've had enough.\" According to some reports, EMI gave Radiohead six months to \"get sorted\" or be dropped. A&R; head Keith Wozencroft later denied this, saying: \"Experimental rock music was getting played and had commercial potential. People voice different paranoias, but for the label [Radiohead] were developing brilliantly from Pablo Honey.\" Radiohead's frustration with \"Creep\" and Pablo Honey influenced the development of their second album, The Bends (1995). The album title, a term for decompression sickness, references Radiohead's rapid rise to fame; Yorke said \"we just came up too fast\". Pablo Honey was certified gold in the UK in April 1994; it was certified platinum in June 1997 and triple platinum in July 2013. In the US, it was certified gold in September 1993 and platinum in September 1995. On 13 May 1995, a live video featuring performances of many Pablo Honey and Bends songs, Live at the Astoria (1995), was released on VHS. ==Critical reception== Pablo Honey failed to make a critical impact upon its initial release. However, several publications were enthusiastic about the band's forthcoming debut release, with NME referring to Radiohead as \"one of rock's brightest hopes\". Pablo Honey would not garner the widespread acclaim of Radiohead's subsequent releases, but received a generally favourable critical reaction. Remarking that \"British teenagerhood has never been grumpier,\" Q felt that it was a \"good\" album with moments that rivalled Nirvana, Dinosaur Jr. and Sugar. NMEs John Harris criticised some \"forgettable\" tracks, finding that \"How Do You?\" \"breaks the momentum... horribly\", but called Pablo Honey \"one of those flawed but satisfying debuts that suggests Radiohead's talents will really blossom later on\". NME named it the 35th-best album of the year, describing it as \"a throwback to a homegrown tradition of great guitar-band albums\". In the United States, \"Creep\" drew parallels with Nirvana, with some describing Radiohead as the \"British Nirvana\". Several music publications gave Pablo Honey positive reviews. Billboard wrote that the guitar sounds and Yorke's vocals were reminiscent of U2, but that the lyrics \"have enough bite to make it on their own\". Marisa Fox of Entertainment Weekly said that the album \"mates Smiths- type self-consciousness with dramatic U2-like vocals and guitar, with Cure- style heavy but crunchy pop\". In a mixed review, Mario Mundoz of the Los Angeles Times wrote that it \"doesn't really deliver anything you haven't heard before, steering too close to Smiths-like melodies and trying ever so hard to be depressed in the way the Cure popularized. Occasionally, though, it does offer clever lyrics and good hooks.\" Robert Christgau of The Village Voice did not recommend the album, but named \"Creep\" a \"choice cut\". Rolling Stone wrote in its year-end review that \"what elevates them to fab charm is not only the feedback and strumming fury of their guitarwork and the dynamism of their whisper-to-a-scream song structures, which recall the Who by way of the early Jam, but the way their solid melodies and sing-along choruses resonate pop appeal\". ==Legacy== Although Pablo Honey was not met with the critical fervour of Radiohead's later albums, it has received praise in retrospective coverage. In 1998, a Virgin poll saw Pablo Honey voted 100th in the all-time top 1000 albums,Maung, Carole Aye. \"Beatles albums are top 3 of all time\" . Daily Mirror. 7 September 1998.

In 2004, Q included \"Lurgee\" and \"Blow Out\" in a list of 20 essential lesser-known Radiohead songs as part of their \"1010 Songs You Must Own\" feature.\"1010 Songs You Must Own (Essential Artists #2 – Radiohead)\" . Q. September 2004. Archived at rocklistmusic.co.uk. In 2006, Classic Rock and its sister publication Metal Hammer named Pablo Honey one of the 20 greatest albums of 1993.Classic Rock/Metal Hammer. \"The 200 greatest albums of the 70s, 80s & 90s\". March 2006. Archived at muzieklijstjes.nl. In 2008, Blender placed it 82nd in its list of \"100 Albums You Must Own\", writing: \"Self-hate couldn't have found a better British exemplification with this band's debut single, which hit the world as part of an album that constructed walls of crunchy guitar tones amidst the dark lyrical content.\" In 2009, Amazon editors ranked Pablo Honey the 26th-greatest debut album. It was voted number 301 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (2000). Retrospectively, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called Pablo Honey \"a promising collection that blends U2's anthemic rock with long, atmospheric instrumental passages and an enthralling triple-guitar attack that is alternately gentle and bracingly noisy. The group has difficulty writing a set of songs that are as compelling as their sound, but when they do hit the mark... the band achieves a rare power that is both visceral and intelligent.\" Kenny EG Perry of NME described the album as \"the sound of one of the best bands of this or any other generation playing the music that taught them all their good early lessons\". Clash argued that it \"points towards everything that [Radiohead] would go on to be\". In a 2008 review, Al Spicer of BBC Music described the album as Radiohead's \"exploration of suburban, adolescent self- awareness\", concluding: \"It all resulted in a stunning blend that combined the best aspects of prog rock... with the plaintiveness of bedsit singer song- writing and the sound of expensive equipment thrashed at by experts. Though later albums were better received, this remains one of rock's most impressive debuts.\" In a review for Amazon.com, critic Louis Pattison wrote: \"Pablo Honey... is much more than filler. 'Anyone Can Play Guitar' is certainly as good as 'Creep'; swathed in walls of feedback, it races blindly into an apocalyptic chorus ... indie-rock seldom got better than this.\" In 2009, PopMatters Mehan Jahasuriya criticised the album as \"a hodgepodge of half- baked grunge, jangle-pop and stadium-ready alternative rock ... nearly indistinguishable from other early '90s college rock throwaways, save for a few hints of greatness\". In 1996, Colin Greenwood said: \"I'd give it a seven out of 10 – not bad for an album recorded in just two and a half weeks.\"Kening, Dan. \"All Grown Up\". Daily Herald. 29 March 1996. Retrieved 25 August 2010. Excerpt at nl.newsbank.com (fee required for complete article). The following year, O'Brien said: \"Heaven forbid anyone should judge us on Pablo Honey. We were in hock to Dinosaur Jr. and the Pixies up to our eyeballs.\" Jonny Greenwood said that it \"lacked freedom\", and was hindered by the band's fear and inexperience. In 2007, Pitchfork wrote that, with Pablo Honey, \"Radiohead didn't so much ride the coattails of grunge to mass success as stumble over them, and they've been apologising for it ever since. In fact, they seem to have something of a complex about it, some deep-seated concern that they first became famous for all the wrong reasons, even if their subsequent output has more than made up for early missteps and misplaced earnestness.\" Though Radiohead achieved greater commercial and critical success with later albums, \"Creep\" remains their most successful single. == Reissues == On 31 August 2009, EMI reissued Pablo Honey in a \"Collector's Edition\" with the Drill EP tracks, B-sides and alternative takes. Radiohead had no input into the reissue and the music was not remastered. In February 2013, Parlophone was bought by Warner Music Group (WMG). In April 2016, as a result of an agreement with the trade group Impala, WMG transferred Radiohead's back catalogue to XL Recordings. The \"Collector's Editions\" of Radiohead albums, issued without Radiohead's approval, were removed from streaming services. In May 2016, XL reissued Radiohead's back catalogue on vinyl, including Pablo Honey. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Radiohead * Colin Greenwood – bass guitar * Jonny Greenwood – lead guitar, piano, organ * Ed O'Brien – guitar, vocals * Philip Selway – drums * Thom Yorke – vocals, guitar Production * Chris Blair – mastering * Chris Hufford – production, engineering * Paul Q.
