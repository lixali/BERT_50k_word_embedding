 "text": "The Dilbert principle is a concept in management developed by Scott Adams, creator of the comic strip Dilbert, which states that companies tend to systematically promote incompetent employees to management to get them out of the workflow. The Dilbert principle is inspired by the Peter principle, which holds that employees are promoted based on success in their current position until they reach their \"level of incompetence\" and are no longer promoted. Under the Dilbert principle, employees who were never competent are promoted to management to limit the damage they can do. Adams first explained the principle in a 1995 Wall Street Journal article, and expanded upon it in his 1996 business book The Dilbert Principle. ==Definition== In the Dilbert strip of February 5, 1995, Dogbert says that \"leadership is nature's way of removing morons from the productive flow\". Adams himself explained, > I wrote The Dilbert Principle around the concept that in many cases the > least competent, least smart people are promoted, simply because they’re the > ones you don't want doing actual work. You want them ordering the doughnuts > and yelling at people for not doing their assignments—you know, the easy > work. Your heart surgeons and your computer programmers—your smart > people—aren't in management. That principle was literally happening > everywhere. Adams explained the principle in a 1995 Wall Street Journal article.Adams, Scott. \"Manager's journal: The Dilbert principle.\" Wall Street Journal [New York, N.Y.] 22 May 1995, Eastern edition: A12. Wall Street Journal. Adams then expanded his study of the Dilbert principle in his 1996 book The Dilbert Principle, which is required or recommended reading at some management and business programs. In the book, Adams writes that, in terms of effectiveness, use of the Dilbert principle is akin to a band of gorillas choosing an alpha- squirrel to lead them by an incredibly convoluted process. The book has sold more than a million copies and was on the New York Times bestseller list for 43 weeks. Adams' presentation of the principle is satirical—facetious but also addressing a real-world concern. ==Comparative principles== The Dilbert principle can be compared to the Peter principle. As opposed to the Dilbert principle, the Peter principle assumes that people are promoted because they are competent, and that the tasks higher up in the hierarchy require skills or talents they do not possess. It concludes that due to this, a competent employee will eventually be promoted to, and then remain at, a position at which he or she is incompetent. In his book, The Peter Principle, Laurence J. Peter explains \"percussive sublimation\", the act of kicking a person upstairs (i.e., promoting him to management) to get him out of the way of productive employees. The Dilbert principle, by contrast, assumes that hierarchy just serves as a means for removing the incompetent to \"higher\" positions where they will be unable to cause damage to the workflow, assuming that the upper echelons of an organization have little relevance to its actual production, and that the majority of real, productive work in a company is done by people lower in the power ladder. Unlike the Peter principle, the promoted individuals were not particularly good at any job they previously held, so placing them in a supervisory position is a way to quietly remove them from the workforce without actually firing them, rather than a reward for meritorious service. An earlier formulation of this effect was known as Putt's Law. ==See also== * ==References== ==Further reading== * The Dilbert Principle by Scott Adams, HarperBusiness (1996) .
