The municipal slogan is \"Vaxholm - the capital of the archipelago\", due to its central location in the archipelago. Its seat is located in the city of Vaxholm. From 1974 to 1984 Vaxholm was united with Österåker Municipality, making up a municipality called Vaxholm, but with the seat in Åkersberga. After the \"divorce\" the new Vaxholm Municipality came out larger than it had been before the amalgamation. The municipality prefers to style itself City of Vaxholm. 64 islets are in the municipality, and also the peninsula Bogesundslandet. ==Localities== *Kullö, 201 inhabitants (2000) *Oskar-Fredriksborg, 692 inhabitants (2000) *Resarö, 2,079 inhabitants (2000) *Vaxholm, 4,887 inhabitants (2000) *Ytterby (mine), a renowned village none|220px|thumb|Municipal detail map ==Demography== ===Population development=== ===Income and Education=== The population in Vaxholm Municipality has the 8th highest median income per capita in Sweden.
