 "text": "Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o (;Archived at Ghostarchive and the Wayback Machine: born James Ngugi; 5 January 1938) is a Kenyan writer and academic who writes primarily in Gikuyu and who formerly wrote in English. His work includes novels, plays, short stories, and essays, ranging from literary and social criticism to children's literature. He is the founder and editor of the Gikuyu-language journal Mũtĩiri. His short story The Upright Revolution: Or Why Humans Walk Upright, is translated into 100 languages from around the world. In 1977, Ngũgĩ embarked upon a novel form of theatre in his native Kenya that sought to liberate the theatrical process from what he held to be \"the general bourgeois education system\", by encouraging spontaneity and audience participation in the performances.Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, Decolonising the Mind: The Politics of Language in African Literature, 1994, pp. 57–59. His project sought to \"demystify\" the theatrical process, and to avoid the \"process of alienation [that] produces a gallery of active stars and an undifferentiated mass of grateful admirers\" which, according to Ngũgĩ, encourages passivity in \"ordinary people\". Although his landmark play, Ngaahika Ndeenda, co-written with Ngugi wa Mirii, was a commercial success, it was shut down by the authoritarian Kenyan regime six weeks after its opening. Ngũgĩ was subsequently imprisoned for over a year. Adopted as an Amnesty International prisoner of conscience, the artist was released from prison, and fled Kenya. In the United States, he is currently Distinguished Professor of Comparative Literature and English at the University of California, Irvine. He has also previously taught at Northwestern University, Yale University, and New York University. Ngũgĩ has frequently been regarded as a likely candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature.Evan Mwangi, \"Despite the Criticism, Ngugi is 'Still Best Writer'\". AllAfrica, 8 November 2010.Page, Benedicte, \"Kenyan author sweeps in as late favourite in Nobel prize for literature\", The Guardian, 5 October 2010.Provost, Claire, \"Ngugi wa Thiong'o: a major storyteller with a resonant development message\", The Guardian, 6 October 2010. He won the 2001 International Nonino Prize in Italy, and the 2016 Park Kyong-ni Prize. Among his children are the authors Mũkoma wa Ngũgĩ and Wanjiku wa Ngũgĩ. == Biography == ===Early years and education=== Ngũgĩ was born in Kamiriithu, near Limuru in Kiambu district, Kenya, of Kikuyu descent, and baptised James Ngugi. His family was caught up in the Mau Mau Uprising; his half-brother Mwangi was actively involved in the Kenya Land and Freedom Army, and his mother was tortured at Kamiriithu home guard post.Nicholls, Brendon. Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, gender, and the ethics of postcolonial reading, 2010, p. 89. He went to the Alliance High School, and went on to study at Makerere University College in Kampala, Uganda. As a student he attended the African Writers Conference held at Makerere in June 1962,Frederick Philander, \"Namibian Literature at the Cross Roads\", New Era, 18 April 2008.Robert Gates, \"African Writers, Readers, Historians Gather In London\", PM News, 27 October 2017. and his play The Black Hermit premiered as part of the event at The National Theatre. At the conference Ngũgĩ asked Chinua Achebe to read the manuscripts of his novels The River Between and Weep Not, Child, which would subsequently be published in Heinemann's African Writers Series, launched in London that year, with Achebe as its first advisory editor.James Currey, \"Ngũgĩ, Leeds and the Establishment of African Literature\", in Leeds African Studies Bulletin 74 (December 2012), pp. 48–62. Ngũgĩ received his B.A. in English from Makerere University College, Uganda, in 1963. ===First publications and studies in England=== His debut novel, Weep Not, Child, was published in May 1964, becoming the first novel in English to be published by a writer from East Africa.Hans M. Zell, Carol Bundy, Virginia Coulon, A New Reader's Guide to African Literature, Heinemann Educational Books, 1983, p. 188. Later that year, having won a scholarship to the University of Leeds to study for an MA, Ngũgĩ travelled to England, where he was when his second novel, The River Between, came out in 1965. The River Between, which has as its background the Mau Mau Uprising, and described an unhappy romance between Christians and non-Christians, was previously on Kenya's national secondary school syllabus. He left Leeds without completing his thesis on Caribbean literature,\"Author Biography\", in A Study Guide for Ngugi wa Thiong'o's \"Petals of Blood\", Gale, 2000. for which his studies had focused on George Lamming, about whom Ngũgĩ said in his 1972 collection of essays Homecoming: \"He evoked for me, an unforgettable picture of a peasant revolt in a white- dominated world. And suddenly I knew that a novel could be made to speak to me, could, with a compelling urgency, touch cords [sic] deep down in me. His world was not as strange to me as that of Fielding, Defoe, Smollett, Jane Austen, George Eliot, Dickens, D. H. Lawrence.\" ===Change of name, ideology and teaching=== Ngũgĩ's 1967 novel A Grain of Wheat marked his embrace of Fanonist Marxism. He subsequently renounced Christianity, writing in English, and the name James Ngugi as colonialist; by 1970 he had changed his name to Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, and began to write in his native Gikuyu. In 1967, Ngũgĩ also began teaching at the University of Nairobi as a professor of English literature. He continued to teach at the university for ten years while serving as a Fellow in Creative Writing at Makerere. During this time, he also guest lectured at Northwestern University in the department of English and African Studies for a year. While a professor at the University of Nairobi, Ngũgĩ was the catalyst of the discussion to abolish the English department. He argued that after the end of colonialism, it was imperative that a university in Africa teach African literature, including oral literature, and that such should be done with the realization of the richness of African languages. === Imprisonment === In 1976 he helped set up The Kamiriithu Community Education and Cultural Centre which, among other things, organised African Theatre in the area. The uncensored political message of his 1977 play Ngaahika Ndeenda (I Will Marry When I Want), co-written with Ngũgĩ wa Mirii, provoked the then Kenyan Vice-President Daniel arap Moi to order his arrest. While detained in the Kamiti Maximum Security Prison, Ngũgĩ wrote the first modern novel in Gikuyu, Devil on the Cross (Caitaani mũtharaba-Inĩ), on prison-issued toilet paper. After his release in December 1978, he was not reinstated to his job as professor at Nairobi University, and his family was harassed. Due to his writing about the injustices of the dictatorial government at the time, Ngugi and his family were forced to live in exile. Only after Arap Moi retired after serving his second and last term in 2002, 22 years later, was it safe for them to return. During his time in prison, Ngũgĩ made the decision to cease writing his plays and other works in English and began writing all his creative works in his native tongue, Gikuyu. His time in prison also inspired the play The Trial of Dedan Kimathi (1976). He wrote this in collaboration with Micere Githae Mugo. ===Exile=== While in exile, Ngugi worked with the London-based Committee for the Release of Political Prisoners in Kenya (1982–98). Matigari ma Njiruungi (translated by Wangui wa Goro into English as Matigari) was published at this time. In 1984, he was Visiting Professor at Bayreuth University, and the following year was Writer-in-Residence for the Borough of Islington in London. He also studied film at Dramatiska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden (1986). His later works include Detained, his prison diary (1981), Decolonising the Mind: The Politics of Language in African Literature (1986), an essay arguing for African writers' expression in their native languages rather than European languages, in order to renounce lingering colonial ties and to build an authentic African literature, and Matigari (translated by Wangui wa Goro), (1987), one of his most famous works, a satire based on a Gikuyu folk tale. Ngũgĩ was Visiting Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Yale University between 1989 and 1992. In 1992, he was guest at the Congress of South African Writers and spent time in Zwide Township with Mzi Mahola, the year he became a professor of Comparative Literature and Performance Studies at New York University, where he held the Erich Maria Remarque Chair. He is currently a Distinguished Professor of English and Comparative Literature as well as having been the first director of the International Center for Writing and Translation at the University of California, Irvine. ===2000s=== On 8 August 2004, Ngũgĩ returned to Kenya as part of a month-long tour of East Africa. On 11 August, robbers broke into his high-security apartment: they assaulted Ngũgĩ, sexually assaulted his wife and stole various items of value. When Ngũgĩ returned to America at the end of his month trip, five men were arrested on suspicion of the crime, including Ngũgĩ's own nephew. In the summer 2006 the American publishing firm Random House published his first new novel in nearly two decades, Wizard of the Crow, translated to English from Gikuyu by the author. On 10 November 2006, while in San Francisco at Hotel Vitale at the Embarcadero, Ngũgĩ was harassed and ordered to leave the hotel by an employee. The event led to a public outcry and angered both African-Americans and members of the African diaspora living in America, prompting an apology by the hotel. His recent books include Globalectics: Theory and the Politics of Knowing (2012), and Something Torn and New: An African Renaissance, a collection of essays published in 2009 making the argument for the crucial role of African languages in \"the resurrection of African memory\", about which Publishers Weekly said: \"Ngugi’s language is fresh; the questions he raises are profound, the argument he makes is clear: 'To starve or kill a language is to starve and kill a people’s memory bank.'\"\"Something Torn and New: An African Renaissance\" (review), Publishers Weekly, 26 January 2009. This was followed by two well received autobiographical works: Dreams in a Time of War: a Childhood Memoir (2010)Busby, Margaret, \"Dreams in a Time of War, By Ngugi wa Thiong'o\" (review), The Independent, 26 March 2010.Jaggi, Maya, \"Dreams in a Time of War by Ngugi wa Thiong'o\" (review), The Guardian, 3 July 2010.Payne, Tom, \"Dreams in a Time of War: a Childhood Memoir by Ngugi wa Thiong’o: review\", The Telegraph, 27 April 2010.Arana, Marie, \"Marie Arana reviews 'Dreams in a Time of War' by Ngugi wa Thiong'o\", Washington Post, 10 March 2010.Dreams in a Time of War at The Complete Review. and In the House of the Interpreter: A Memoir (2012), which was described as \"brilliant and essential\" by the Los Angeles Times,Tobar, Hector, \"Ngugi wa Thiong'o soars 'In the House of the Interpreter'\", Los Angeles Times, 16 November 2012. among other positive reviews.Busby, Margaret, \"In the House of the Interpreter: A Memoir, By Ngugi wa Thiong'o\" (review), The Independent, 1 December 2012.\"In the House of the Interpreter\" review, Kirkus Reviews, 29 August 2012.Mushava, Stanely, \"A portrait of the dissident as a young man\", The Herald (Zimbabwe), 10 August 2015. His book The Perfect Nine, originally written and published in Gikuyu as Kenda Muiyuru: Rugano Rwa Gikuyu na Mumbi (2019), was translated into English by Ngũgĩ for its 2020 publication, and is a reimagining in epic poetry of his people's origin story. It was described by the Los Angeles Times as \"a quest novel-in-verse that explores folklore, myth and allegory through a decidedly feminist and pan-African lens.\" The review in World Literature Today said: > \"Ngũgĩ crafts a beautiful retelling of the Gĩkũyũ myth that emphasizes the > noble pursuit of beauty, the necessity of personal courage, the importance > of filial piety, and a sense of the Giver Supreme—a being who represents > divinity, and unity, across world religions. All these things coalesce into > dynamic verse to make The Perfect Nine a story of miracles and perseverance; > a chronicle of modernity and myth; a meditation on beginnings and endings; > and a palimpsest of ancient and contemporary memory, as Ngũgĩ overlays the > Perfect Nine's feminine power onto the origin myth of the Gĩkũyũ people of > Kenya in a moving rendition of the epic form.\" Fiona Sampson writing in The Guardian concluded that it is \"a beautiful work of integration that not only refuses distinctions between 'high art' and traditional storytelling, but supplies that all-too rare human necessity: the sense that life has meaning.\" In March 2021, The Perfect Nine became the first work written in an indigenous African language to be longlisted for the International Booker Prize, with Ngũgĩ becoming the first nominee as both the author and translator of the same book. == Family == Four of his children are also published authors: Tee Ngũgĩ, Mũkoma wa Ngũgĩ, Nducu wa Ngũgĩ, and Wanjiku wa Ngũgĩ. ==Awards and honours== *1963: The East Africa Novel Prize *1964: Unesco First Prize for his novel, Weep Not Child, at the First World Festival of Black and African arts at Dakar, Senegal *1973: The Lotus Prize for Literature, at Alma Atta, Khazakhistan *1992 (6 April): The Paul Robeson award for Artistic Excellence, Political Conscience and Integrity, in Philadelphia *1992 (October): honoured by New York University by being appointed to the Erich Maria Remarque Professorship in Languages to \"acknowledge extraordinary scholarly achievement, strong leadership in the University Community and the Profession and significant contribution to our educational mission.\" *1993: The Zola Neale Hurston-Paul Robeson Award, for artistic and scholarly achievement, awarded by the National Council for Black Studies, in Accra, Ghana *1994 (October): The Gwendolyn Brooks Center Contributors Award for significant contribution to The Black Literary Arts *1996: The Fonlon-Nichols Prize, New York, for Artistic Excellence and Human Rights *2001: Nonino International Prize for Literature *2002: Zimbabwe International Book Fair, \"The Best Twelve African Books of the Twentieth Century.\" *2002 (July): Distinguished Professor of English and Comparative Literature, UCI. *2002 (October): Medal of the Presidency of the Italian Cabinet Awarded by the International Scientific Committee of the Pio Manzu Centre, Rimini, Italy. *2003 (May): Honorary Foreign Member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. *2003 (December): Honorary Life Membership of the Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa (CODESRIA), *2004 (23–28 February): Visiting Fellow, Humanities Research Centre. *2006: Wizard of the Crow is No. 3 on Time magazine's Top 10 Books of the Year (European edition) *2006: Wizard of the Crow is one of The Economists Best Books of the Year *2006: Wizard of the Crow is one of Salon.coms picks for Best Fiction of the year *2006: Wizard of the Crow is the winner of the Winter 2007 Read This! for Lit-Blog Co-Op; The Literary Saloon *2006: Wizard of the Crow highlighted in the Washington Post’s Favorite Books of the year. *2007: Wizard of the Crow - Finalist on the Long List for the 2007 Independent Foreign Fiction Prize. *2007: Wizard of the Crow - Finalist on the NAACP Image Award for Fiction *2007: Wizard of the Crow - finalist on the 2007 Commonwealth Writers' Prize Shortlist for Best Book – Africa. *2007: Wizard of the Crow - Gold medal winner in Fiction for the 2007 California Book Awards *2007: Wizard of the Crow - 2007 Aspen Prize for Literature *2007: Wizard of the Crow – Finalist for the 2007 Hurston/Wright Legacy Award for Black Literature *2008: Wizard of the Crow nominated for the 2008 IMPAC Dublin Award *2008 (2 April): Order of the Elder of Burning Spear (Kenya Medal – conferred by Kenya’s Ambassador to the United States in Los Angeles). *2008: (October, 24) Grinzane for Africa Award *2008: Dan and Maggie Inouye Distinguished Chair in Democratic Ideals, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. *2009: Shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize\"Ngugi Wa Thiong’o\" Booker Prize Foundation.
