 "text": "Litchfield is a town in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 8,478 at the 2020 census. == History == Prior to European settlement, the area was populated by the Abenaki people. They were skilled with fishing and were adept in agriculture as well. The New Hampshire Archaeological Society has located over 30 Native American sites along the shore of the Merrimack River in Litchfield, with artifacts several thousands of years old being uncovered. left|thumb|Extent of Old Dunstable (dashed line), which included much of modern-day Litchfield Most of Litchfield was part of the large town known as Dunstable, which was organized in the 1600s and included land along both sides of the disputed New Hampshire-Massachusetts boundary, and out of which were carved several towns and cities in both states. The area which became Litchfield was originally known as \"Naticook\". In 1656, William Brenton, colonial governor of Rhode Island, was granted land which included much of present-day Litchfield. The name was changed to \"Brenton's Farm\" in 1729. The town was first incorporated into Massachusetts on July 4, 1734. The first town meeting was held on Monday, July 29, 1734, at 1 pm at the house of Aquila Underwood to choose town officers. In 1749, the land was granted to another group of settlers and named \"Litchfield\" after George Henry Lee, Earl of Lichfield. Litchfield was incorporated into the Province of New Hampshire on June 5, 1749. Litchfield lacks any major population center or central village. Historically farmland, the town experienced steep population growth starting in the 1970s, along with the rest of southern New Hampshire, as a bedroom community and exurb for Greater Boston. The original town hall was located along New Hampshire Route 3A in the east-central portion of the town; the current town hall lies at the town's geographic center at the intersection of Hillcrest Road and Albuquerque Avenue. There are no large commercial districts in the town, though a few small industrial parks, convenience stores, and small restaurants dot the landscape. == Geography == According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and is water, comprising 2.50% of the town. The highest point in Litchfield is the summit of Rocky Hill, near the center of town in Litchfield State Forest, at above sea level. The town is bordered to the north by Manchester, to the east by Londonderry in Rockingham County, to the south by Hudson, to the west by Merrimack, and to the extreme southwest by Nashua, with the Merrimack River separating Litchfield from both Merrimack and Nashua. There is no bridge connecting Litchfield and Merrimack; the closest river crossings are to the south between Nashua and Hudson, and to the north between Manchester and Bedford. There are two islands in the Merrimack River within the borders of Litchfield. The islands have been called \"Minnewawa\" and \"Nunnehaha\", the Naticook Islands, and Reed's Islands. The northern island is located within Litchfield, while the southern island is essentially split down the middle by the boundary between Litchfield and Merrimack, forming the only land border between the two towns. Merrimack owns both islands. === Adjacent municipalities === * Manchester, New Hampshire (north) * Londonderry, New Hampshire (east) * Hudson, New Hampshire (south & southeast) * Nashua, New Hampshire (southwest) * Merrimack, New Hampshire (west) ==Demographics== As of the census of 2000, there were 7,360 people, 2,357 households, and 2,031 families residing in the town.
