 "text": "Palco is a city in Rooks County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 208. ==History== Palco was established in 1888 by Union Pacific Railroad as a train depot on a newly formed line. The town was given the name Palco for railroad officials Palmer and Cole. The post office was moved from the nearby town of Cresson. Cresson (named for Cresson, PA) was granted a post office in 1879. In 1887, rumors circulated that the railroad would lay track 1-1/2 miles to the south of Cresson. Many citizens and businesses abandoned Cresson to form the community of New Cresson along the expected railroad route. When the railroad track was laid it curved to the north missing New Cresson. The town was soon abandoned. An ironic twist is that the northern route of the track passed near the original town of Cresson.Palco Kansas Centennial September 1988, 1988, p.19.
