 "text": "Marshall is a town in Oneida County, New York, United States. The population was 2,131 at the 2010 census. The Town of Marshall is in the southeastern part of the county and is located southwest of Utica. == History == The first settlers were the Brothertown Indians, a group of about 400 people formed from scattered remnants of tribes from New England and Long Island, led by Asa Dick and Samson Occom, who arrived around 1774. They were granted land by the Oneida Indians, for the purpose of creating a new township for Christian Indians. They made their homes around the Oriskany Creek, which provided power for their grist mills. Many Brotherton Indians left town during the Revolutionary War, returning after end of the war to farm. Because Brotherton Indians came from different peoples whose languages were not mutually intelligible, many adopted the English language. The number of Brotherton Indians had dwindled by 1850, with some succumbing to alcoholism, and others selling their land and moving to Green Bay, Wisconsin. The first white settlers arrived in 1794 and settled in the higher regions, in Hanover and the west hills.
