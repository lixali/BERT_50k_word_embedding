 "text": "Arcadia were a new wave British group formed in 1985 by Simon Le Bon, Nick Rhodes, and Roger Taylor of Duran Duran as a side project during a break in the band's schedule. The project was only active during 1985 and 1986 for just one album, So Red the Rose, which was certified Platinum in the United States and included the singles \"Election Day\", \"Goodbye Is Forever\", \"The Flame\" and \"The Promise (ft. David Gilmour and Sting)\". Drummer Roger Taylor appeared in only a few band photographs, in one music video (Election Day), and stated he was only to be involved in the recording side of the project (he also had minor involvement in The Power Station, the other Duran Duran splinter group formed by Duran Duran's Andy and John Taylor alongside Robert Palmer and Tony Thompson of Chic). The name of the band was reportedly inspired by the Nicolas Poussin painting Et in Arcadia ego (also known as \"The Arcadian Shepherds\"). ==Music career== ===So Red the Rose (1985)=== The group recorded just one album, the platinum-selling So Red the Rose. It peaked at No. 30 in the UK and No. 23 in the US, and featured the UK/US Top 10 single \"Election Day\", as well as the top 40 hits \"The Promise\" and \"Goodbye Is Forever\". It also contains the single \"The Flame\" and the promo-singles \"Missing\", \"El Diablo\", and \"Keep Me in the Dark\". Simon Le Bon described So Red the Rose as \"the most pretentious album ever made,\" while AllMusic called it \"the best album Duran Duran never made\". Musicians who contributed to the album included guitarists David Gilmour (Pink Floyd) and Carlos Alomar, pianist Herbie Hancock, Sting (who provided backing vocals on \"The Promise\"), Grace Jones (who provided the spoken-word interlude on \"Election Day\"), bass player Mark Egan of the Pat Metheny Group (whose distinctive fretless sound can be recognised in \"The Promise\", \"El Diablo\", and \"Lady Ice\"), Masami Tsuchiya, and David Van Tieghem, a percussionist from New York. A video collection was also released which featured music videos for the singles directed by Roger Christian, Marcelo Anciano, Russell Mulcahy, and Dean Chamberlain. The band also recorded and released the standalone single \"Say the Word\" for the Playing for Keeps movie soundtrack, which was not included on So Red the Rose. EMI re-released the album as a three disc box set in April 2010. This remastering collected all permutations and remixes of tracks released by the band. The third disc comprised the video collection on DVD, but it does not include the video for \"Say the Word\". ===Band changes=== Arcadia continued the Duran Duran tradition of a slick image. For the Arcadia incarnation of their ever-changing band aesthetic, Le Bon, Rhodes, and Roger Taylor donned an upmarket 'gothic' look of black tuxedos, vintage formal wear, and bow ties. The three also dyed their hair black, as seen when they performed (as Duran Duran, with Andy and John Taylor) at the 1985 Live Aid concert in Philadelphia. By the time the video for their single \"The Flame\" was made in early 1986 (in which John Taylor made a cameo), Rhodes had changed his hair colour to golden blond and Le Bon returned to his regular highlighted hairstyle. ===Other appearances=== The group made a variety of promotional appearances on television, but never toured. When Duran Duran released their Notorious album and toured, \"Election Day\" was included as part of the set as well as \"Some Like it Hot\" from The Power Station. Drummer Roger Taylor retired from the music business for 15 years after the release of the Arcadia album, but returned to rejoin the most famous classic Duran Duran lineup in 2001. ==Band members== * Simon Le Bon - vocals (1985-1986) * Nick Rhodes - keyboards (1985-1986) * Roger Taylor - drums (1985) ==Guest musicians== * Carlos Alomar : Guitar * Pierre Defaye : Violin * Rafael De Jesus : Percussion * Jean-Claude Dubois : Harp * Mark Egan : Bass on The Promise, El Diablo and Lady Ice * David Gilmour : Guitar on The Promise and Missing * Herbie Hancock : Piano * Steve Jordan : Percussion * Grace Jones : Voice on Election Day * Andy Mackay : Saxophone * Sting : Vocals on The Promise * David Van Tieghem : Percussion ==Discography== ===Studio album=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! rowspan=\"2\"| Album details ! colspan=\"6\"| Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\"| Certifications (sales threshold) |- style=\"font-size:smaller;\" ! style=\"width:30px;\"| UK ! style=\"width:30px;\"| US ! style=\"width:30px;\"| AUS ! style=\"width:30px;\"| SWE ! style=\"width:30px;\"| NZ ! style=\"width:30px;\"| CAN |- | 1985 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| So Red the Rose * Release date: November 1985 * Label: Capitol/Universal | 30 | 23 | 35 | 48 | 22 | 14 | style=\"text- align:left;\"| * US: Platinum * CAN: 2× Platinum |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! rowspan=\"2\"| Single ! colspan=\"9\"| Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- style=\"font-size:smaller;\" ! style=\"width:30px;\"| UK ! style=\"width:30px;\"| US ! style=\"width:30px;\"| US Dance ! style=\"width:30px;\"| AUS ! style=\"width:30px;\"| NZ ! style=\"width:30px;\"| NOR ! style=\"width:30px;\"| NL ! style=\"width:30px;\"| SWI ! style=\"width:30px;\"| IRE |- | rowspan=\"2\"| 1985 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| \"Election Day\" | 7 | 6 | 29 | 13 | 4 | 7 | 12 | 18 | 5 | style=\"text-align:left;\" rowspan=\"4\"| So Red the Rose |- | style=\"text- align:left;\"| \"Goodbye Is Forever\" | — | 33 | — | 77 | — | — | — | — | — |- | rowspan=\"3\"| 1986 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| \"The Promise\" | 37 | — | — | 94 | — | — | — | — | 24 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| \"The Flame\" | 58 | — | — | — | — | — | 38 | — | 29 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| \"Say the Word\" | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Playing for Keeps (soundtrack) |- | colspan=\"15\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart |} ==Videography== ===Video albums=== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Title !Distributor |- |rowspan=\"2\"|1987 |Arcadia |Picture Music International (MVP 9911382) |- |The Videos |Castle Communications (CMV 1054) |} ===Music videos=== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Title !Director |- |rowspan=\"2\"|1985 |\"Election Day\" |Roger Christian |- |\"The Promise\" |rowspan=\"2\"|Marcelo Anciano |- |rowspan=\"4\"|1986 |\"Goodbye Is Forever\" |- |\"The Flame\" |Russell Mulcahy |- |\"Say the Word\" (theme from Playing for Keeps) | |- |\"Missing\" (originally unreleased) |Dean Chamberlain |} ==References== ==External links== * So Red The Rose Arcadia archive and fansite Category:Duran Duran Category:English art rock groups Category:English new wave musical groups Category:English pop music groups Category:British synth-pop new wave groups Category:Musical groups established in 1985 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1986 Category:Spin-offs Category:1985 establishments in the United Kingdom",
