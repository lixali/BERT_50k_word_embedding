Drygalski Island was first viewed from the continental Antarctic coast in November 1912 by members of the Western Base Party of the Australian Antarctic Expedition (1911-1914), and observed more closely from Sir Douglas Mawson's ship Aurora on the homeward journey in January 1914. Because Drygalski Island was thought to be \"Drygalski's High Land\", charted by Professor Erich von Drygalski of the German Antarctic Expedition (1901-1903) in 1902, Drygalski's name was given by Sir Douglas Mawson to the island.
