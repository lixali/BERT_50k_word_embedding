As of the 2010 United States Census, the township's population was 1,952, reflecting an increase of 61 (+3.2%) from the 1,891 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 172 (+10.0%) from the 1,719 counted in the 1990 Census.Table 7. Population for the Counties and Municipalities in New Jersey: 1990, 2000 and 2010, New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, February 2011. Accessed June 6, 2013. The 2010 Census population marked the first decennial census in which the township's population exceeded the 1,903 recorded in the 1840 Census, the first recorded population after the township was formed. Hope Township was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 8, 1839, from portions of Knowlton Township and Oxford Township, based on the results of a referendum held that day. Liberty Township was created on March 25, 1926, from portions of the township.Snyder, John P.

Accessed October 26, 2012. ==History== thumb|upright=1.2|left|The Moravian Church in Hope, NJ is now the headquarters for the Bank of Hope. Hope Township is one of the earliest planned communities in the United States, having been established by German Moravians in 1769. They knew what they wanted to achieve, which is shown on several early planning maps, which detail streets, homes, wells, businesses, farms, a school, tavern and church.Antonoff, Paul S. \"The Moravian Village of Hope Is Marked as a Historic Site; A Planned Community\", The New York Times, October 7, 1973. Accessed September 11, 2013. Prior to the arrival of the Moravians, there was no distinct town, but several families farmed on Jenny Jump Mountain, to the south of Hope, in surrounding area and on John Samuel Green Jr.'s farm in the center of what is now the Village. Throughout the 1760s, Moravians from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania traveled through this area on their way to New England to establish new communities. They lodged overnight with the Green Family who were impressed with their religion and way of life. upright=1.2|thumb|Old gristmill in Hope The Moravians were a religious group whose formal name was the \"Unitas Fratrum\" or Unity of the Brethren. They were followers of Jan Hus, the reformer from Prague who protested against the Roman Catholic Church in 1415 and was finally burned at the stake for his rebellion. These followers continued to practice his views in Moravia and Bohemia in what is now the Czech Republic, hence the common name \"The Moravians\". In the late 17th century this group began to be persecuted and sought shelter away from Bohemia. Count Nicolas Ludwig von Zinzendorf offered them refuge on his lands east of Dresden, Germany, and provided a base for them to regroup and pursue their religion. That settlement which remains as the center of the worldwide Moravian religion is called Herrnhut or \"The Lord's Watch\" inhabitants were not only \"under the Lord's watchful care\" but were also to be \"on watch for the Lord\". With the support of Count von Zinzendorf, the Church established over 200 missionary settlements. After a formal survey of the Village completed on November 26, 1774, the community was officially accepted by The Moravian Church and the name was changed by drawing lots on February 8, 1775, from Greenland to Hope.History, Hope Township. Accessed September 2, 2015. \"After a formal survey of the Village completed on November 26, 1774, the community was officially accepted by The Moravian Church and the name was changed by drawing lots on February 8, 1775 from Greenland to Hope.\" The name derives from the \"hope of immortality\" of the early Moravian settlers.Hutchinson, Viola L. The Origin of New Jersey Place Names, New Jersey Public Library Commission, May 1945. Accessed September 2, 2015. After almost 40 years of the Moravian \"experiment\" in Hope, the community was sold and almost all of the Moravians returned to Bethlehem or Nazareth, Pennsylvania. The basic reason for closing the community was that it was never self-supporting and had declined from its height of population of 147 to under 100 people by the early 19th century. The Church in Germany could no longer subsidize such a small village. Moravians worldwide were selling possessions and even some other entire communities to pay off debts incurred years earlier by Count von Zinzendorf, who heavily mortgaged his lands to give them opportunity back in Germany. Disease and a competitive gristmill also contributed to Moravian Hope's decline. ==Geography== According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 18.29 square miles (47.38 km2), including 18.08 square miles (46.83 km2) of land and 0.21 square miles (0.55 km2) of water (1.15%).
