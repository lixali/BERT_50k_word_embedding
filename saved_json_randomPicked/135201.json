 "text": "Gruetli-Laager ( ) is a city in Grundy County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 1,813 at the 2010 census. As its name implies, Gruetli-Laager consists of two communities-- Gruetli and Laager-- incorporated as a single city. ==History== Gruetli was founded by German-speaking Swiss immigrants in 1869. The town was part of a greater initiative-- conducted by an organization known as the Tennessee Kolonisation Gesellschaft-- to establish Swiss colonies atop the Cumberland Plateau in Tennessee.Claudette Stager, \"Gruetli.\" The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved 9 February 2013. Gruetli was probably named after a commune in the Swiss canton of Glarus.Tennessee Historical Commission marker 2E 43 on State Route 108. Information obtained 30 November 2008. Peter Staub, a member of Knoxville's thriving Swiss community, helped purchase the initial tract of land for Gruetli. The land was advertised in Switzerland, where the opportunity for a new start appealed to many families struggling with difficult economic conditions in Europe. left|210px|thumb|Tennessee Historical Commission marker along State Route 108 Although over 100 Swiss families moved to the Gruetli area in the 1870s, many were disappointed by the land's poor quality and relative isolation, and thus relocated to nearby cities. Nevertheless, by 1880, Grundy County had the largest Swiss population of any county in Tennessee. Prominent early settlers at Gruetli included Christian Marugg, who operated an inn along the stagecoach road between Chattanooga and McMinnville, and Melchior Thoni, Jr. (1849â€“1926), a woodcarver whose work was displayed in the old Governor's Mansion and the Christ Church in Nashville.Tennessee Historical Commission marker 2E 71 on TN-108.

Laager was established as a railroad stopover (initially known as \"Henley's Switch\") in 1918.
