Olcott-Newfane Airport (D80) is located south of the village, but is closed indefinitely except for ultralight aircraft. Olcott was known for its Coney Island-like beach attractions and attracted tourists visiting nearby Niagara Falls. Many of these attractions have closed, however, after the decline of the City of Niagara Falls and a prolonged economic downturn which has hard hit all of Niagara County. Slowly, efforts are being made to bring back this economic prosperity that the region once saw, and so far has been a success in Olcott. Heritage tourism has become quite popular in Niagara County, and new festivals include the Olcott Pirate Festival as well as a famous car show that takes place during the summer.
