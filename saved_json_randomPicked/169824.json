The first two games - Manic Miner and Jet Set Willy - were written by computer-game programmer Matthew Smith during the early 1980s. The Willy saga was to be a trilogy and a third game in the series was planned, Miner Willy Meets The Taxman. The series started in 1983 with the release of Manic Miner, and was followed up a year later with Jet Set Willy (one of the best selling video games of all time) and Jet Set Willy II.
