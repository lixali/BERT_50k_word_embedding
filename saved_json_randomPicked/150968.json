Due to its location on the border between Osage county and Tulsa county, Skiatook has been referred to as \"the Gateway to the Osage.\" The town includes the state highway junction of Oklahoma State Highway 11 and Oklahoma State Highway 20. The population was 7,397 at the 2010 census, an increase of 37.1 percent over the figure of 5,396 recorded in 2000. ==History== ===Battle of Chustenahlah=== The Battle of Chustenahlah was fought just west of Skiatook, on December 26, 1861, during the American Civil War. The battle began when Confederate Col. James McIntosh ordered an attack on the Union aligned Creek Chief Opothleyahola's forces. Opothleyahola was travelling with about 1,700 Creek and Seminole refugees following his defeat at the Battle of Chusto-Talasah. After being defeated by the Confederate forces, many refugees were forced to abandoned their supplies as they fled to Kansas. A historical marker commemorates the battle. ===Origin of name=== William C. Rogers, last hereditary Chief of the Cherokees, founded Skiatook in 1872, when he established a trading post in the Cherokee Nation on the south bank of Bird Creek. When a post office was established in Rogers' store in 1872, the place was named Ski-a-took. The word is Cherokee in origin, and means \"Big-Indian- Me\" or refers to something of large size. An Osage trader, Skiatooka is also cited as influencing the town's name. In 1892, the name was changed from Ski- a-took to Skiatook.Anna Mae Henderson, \"Skiatook,\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Accessed April 4, 2015. ===20th century=== On December 18, 1904, a bank was established on the present day location of Skiatook. William C. Rogers relocated his general store and post office to the town and began building near the bank. In March 1905 the Midland Valley Railroad was built through the town and the settlement expanded to include parts of Osage County and the Osage Nation. The route no longer exists, but has been converted from rail into the 14.5 mile Osage Prairie Trail linking Skiatook with Tulsa to the south. Skiatook's first newspaper, the Skiatook Sentinel, began publication in April 1905 and the town was incorporated shortly after on May 28, 1905. Skiatook's first school was also founded in 1905. After Oklahoma Statehood in 1907, construction began on permanent roads and bridges. The first church building constructed in Skiatook was the First Christian Church in 1907. Before this, congregations met in several places in town, including homes and businesses. Cement sidewalks were constructed between 1909 and 1910, and in 1912 Skiatook received water, sewer and electric light improvements. The area experienced much growth in the oil, gas and farm industries. Increased traffic through town warranted better streets, and by the fall of 1919, Skiatook had 15 blocks of continuous cement paved streets. A road to Tulsa was paved in the early 1920s, and with good roads leading out in all directions, Skiatook became known as the \"Gateway to all points North, South, East and West\". In the 1930s, Skiatook began purchasing water from Spavinaw. The completion of Skiatook Lake in 1984 gave Skiatook its own water source. ==Demographics== As of the 2010 census, there were 7,397 people, 2,796 households, and 1,989 families residing in the town.

During the Pioneer Day festival people line the streets along Rogers Boulevard in downtown for the parade; in the past the street was blocked so a dance could be held in the evening, although this is no longer feasible due to the heavy traffic volume through town on Highway 20. Skiatook has a master plan for the revitalization of its downtown. One part is the formation of the Skiatook Main Street Association, a \"Main Street program\" which will help revitalize the downtown area with business growth, design guideline conformity, and deal with various issues that affect Skiatook's main street. ==Arts and culture== ===Skiatook Museum=== Downtown is also home to the Skiatook Museum. The Skiatook Museum was established thanks to the people who kept mementos, scrapbooks, pictures, letters, and artifacts; such as C. H. Cleveland and Mrs. G. B. Epperson, who left the book \"Skiatook 1872 to 1921.\" The Skiatook Historical Society was organized in April 1976. The goal of the members was to preserve the interesting history of Skiatook from its beginning to the present time. In 1988, after 5 moves, the Skiatook Museum moved into the home of pioneer doctor W. G. Phillips. The home, built in 1912, contained his office. In 1910, Dr. Phillips settled in Skiatook and served the community for 50 years. His medical diploma and college graduation picture are on display at the museum. The Skiatook Museum made Dr. Phillips' house its permanent home with the aid of the Oklahoma Historical Society, including grants to refurbish the house and set up display areas within its walls. The museum board conducted a successful building fund campaign in 1999 and completed an addition to the home which has added much-needed space for the display of local historical documents, as well as furniture and other household items of the town's pioneers. Historians, students and all those looking for their family tree, who are searching for Skiatook's past can view the personal papers, documents and photographs of the town's pioneer families, events and places at the museum. Also provided is a microfilm reader to enable visitors to research into newspapers dating back to April 1905, the date the first newspaper in town began publishing. ===Annual events=== Skiatook hosts several events throughout the year, including the Pioneer Days Festival, complete with a parade, fly-in, Chili cook-off, art show, tractor show, car show, delicious food from various vendors, rides, vintage planes, and a rodeo; the \"Fantasy in the Sky\" Fourth of July celebration with concerts, food, and fireworks at the local airport; a Bluegrass Festival; a fine art & quilt show in October; various fishing tournaments; and a Christmas parade. ==Parks and recreation== Skiatook Lake, Skiatook Statuary (Producer of the World's Largest Ornamental Concrete, and the first producer to ship to Russia), Skiatook Museum, The Healing Rock, Civil War Battle Marker (Battle of Chustenahlah), Captain's Cemetery, Hillside Cemetery, View from Javine Hill, Horse and Cattle Ranches, Skiatook Airport, John Zink Scout Ranch, Herbert Pinc Auditorium, the newly constructed arena (the Skiatook Multi-Purpose Activity Center) which will seat 6,000 people, Woodland Christmas Tree Farm, Vegetable and Fruit Market, Pecan and Flower Market, Community Building, Cedar Crest Golf course, CrossTimbers Resort & Marina, and Crystal Bay Marina and finally the hillside cemetery home of the witches grave.

It is one of five projects in the Bird Creek Basin plan recommended to meet the comprehensive water resources needs of the area. The Damsite is located on Hominy Creek about west of Skiatook in Osage County, Oklahoma. The project serves the purposes of flood control, water quality, water supply, recreation, and fish and wildlife management. The total cost of the project was approximately $120 million. It was completed in 1984. Elevated above sea level, the lake has a surface area of about 10,500 acres (42 km2) and of shoreline. Skiatook Lake has brought tremendous growth to the surrounding Skiatook area since its completion. In 2010 Skiatook opened a $2.3 million park that features splash pads, new playground equipment and even a pond and walking trails. Osage Trail walking trail is 14.5 miles long, starting in Skiatook. The shoreline is accentuated by steep picturesque bluffs which offer fantastic views. Boating, hiking, swimming, camping, picnicking as well as hunting and fishing are all popular activities at the lake.

Largemouth bass, black and white crappie, channel catfish, and several species of sunfish are plentiful in Skiatook Lake. Whitetail deer, rabbit, squirrel, beaver, quail, and many more bird species are plentiful around the lake. Even a few coyote have been seen. During the seasons, about 8,000 acres (32 km2) of this land are open for hunting. There are several places open to camping, including Tallchief Cove, Bull Creek and Twin Points campgrounds. Other parks on the lake include Blackdog Park, Osage Park, Quapaw Park, Hominy Landing and Skiatook Point. About 1,800 acres (7.3 km2) of land around the lake have been set aside for public use areas. These areas provide roads, parking spaces, boat ramps, nature trails, picnicking and camping sites along with sanitary facilities. These areas remain attractive to the user and blend in with the natural landscape surrounding the lake. ==Government== Skiatook has a city government with a 7-member city council and a City Manager.
