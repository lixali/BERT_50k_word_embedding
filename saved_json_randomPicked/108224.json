Its location made it ideal for commerce and transportation during the California Gold Rush. In 1868--1869, it was connected to the First Transcontinental Railroad at Sacramento via the California Pacific Railroad (Cal-P) main line, expanding the region's reach across the United States. By 1879 Central Pacific Railroad owned the Cal-P mainline and rerouted the transcontinental overland route through the new branch from Port Costa, via the railroad ferry Solano to Benicia, across the Suisun Marsh to Suisun City, putting the region directly on the overland route from San Francisco to Ogden and beyond. In the 1960s and 1970s, Suisun City experienced rapid growth as the San Francisco Bay Area's suburban ring expanded to the formerly rural Solano County. Also in the 1960s, Interstate 80 was constructed two miles (3 km) outside the city, effectively moving commercial traffic away from railways and water conveyance. ==Transportation== *Fairfield and Suisun Transit *Suisun/Fairfield Amtrak station ==Sister cities== *Naguilian, La Union, Philippines ==References== ==External links== * Category:1868 establishments in California Category:Cities in Solano County, California Category:Cities in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Incorporated cities and towns in California Category:Populated places established in 1868",
