Its seat is located in the city of Motala. In 1971 Motala Municipality was formed by the amalgamation of the City of Motala with some of the adjacent rural municipalities. Three years later more entities were added, among them the former City of Vadstena. In 1980 a new Vadstena Municipality was split off. Geographically, Motala is situated where Lake Vättern drains into the river system of Motala ström, which was of central importance to the massive industrialization of Sweden in the 19th century. ==Sights and museums== *Charlottenborg Castle *Godegård manorhouse with the Swedish Porcelain Museum *Göta Canal with locks *Medevi 17th century spa, the oldest in Sweden *Motala Church *Motala Motor Museum *The Museum of Motala Industrial History *Nubbekullen, birthplace of artist August Malmström *The Swedish Broadcasting Museum with the twin radio towers *Ulvåsa, manorhouse and medieval ruins of St Bridget's home *Varamon beach *Västra Stenby Church and rune stone *Övralid, manorhouse and home of author Verner von Heidenstam ==Localities== Figures as of 2000, from Statistics Sweden. #Motala 30,136 (seat) #Borensberg 2,667 #Tjällmo 562 #Fornåsa 446 #Nykyrka 434 #Fågelsta 334 #Österstad 329 #Klockrike 275 #Godegård 200 The population decreased by approximately 2% in most of the localities between the earlier census 1995 and the one in 2000. ==Industry== The largest employer is the municipality itself, employing circa 3,400 people.
