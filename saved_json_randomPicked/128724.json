Its seat is located in the town of Karlsborg. The present municipality was formed in 1971 when \"old\" Karlsborg was amalgamated with Mölltorp and Undenäs. The area has been dominated by Karlsborg Fortress and military activity throughout the last centuries. Tiveden National Park is partly situated within the municipality. The Flugebyn airfield, home of the Västergötland Skydiving Club (Västergötlands Fallskärmsklubb) also lies in the municipality. ==References== ==External links== * *Karlsborg Municipality - Official site Category:Municipalities of Västra Götaland County Category:Skaraborg",
